[SPEAKER_00]: All righty gang, we're back at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're joined by our good friend Dire Wolf
to talk all things Canadian history,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, trends, the future, so much
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very excited to have him on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us again,
Dire Wolf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure, always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: First question I want to know,
what have you been smoking on today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or have you been smoking today?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you smoking on yesterday?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not been smoking today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working all day, but I'm
actually traveling at the moment all week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to think what I've got in my
travel jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have Ghost of Leroy from Rare
Dankness, which is kind of like a ghost OG
[SPEAKER_01]: triangle cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some Purple Kush, which is like a Canadian
classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got some GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually just got a couple of days
ago from visiting some big commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil friends of mine that gave me
some of the, they've always got the newest
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they gave me gas truffles and
greasy runs and something else I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a good selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does sound really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to jump into a few of those and
hear your thoughts, but just out of
[SPEAKER_00]: curiosity, you mentioned quite a nice
range of genetics, you know, from the old
[SPEAKER_00]: school Purple Kush through to the newest,
you know, greasy runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What stands out the most to you out of the
four or five you just sort of mentioned?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, honestly, that one, to me,
that's kind of a lovely relationship with
[SPEAKER_01]: it because it's so nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you crave it and sometimes you
cringe when you open the jar, but I still
[SPEAKER_01]: think that's a strain all the way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I think I lost you for a second
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the name of that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard everything, just not the name of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was saying the rankness of GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of curiosity, have you ever had
many strains from rare dankness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've actually grown out Ghost of
Leroy myself and thought it was a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good strain, but I feel like you don't
hear a lot about rare dankness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever had much experience with
their genetics or not particularly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not particularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, I only ever bought one pack
from him quite a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was at standout pack where I would
consider it one of the best packs I've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever bought in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like whatever, 10 or 12 pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was two like super, super nice
OGs that came out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one is actually, I think that's
the longest I've of any of the clones that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've held personally that I popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one I was super impressed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the Ghost of Leroy, was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was a Ghost of Leroy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I picked that one myself as
well is because it's so heavy on the OG,
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like TK into Ghost into TK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cool one for if you're looking for
OG in seed form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I actually just picked it randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just at a trade show for something
else and I just randomly bought it and I
[SPEAKER_01]: just wanted to try an OG pack and it
turned out super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a funny strain because that clone,
when I first ran it, it's still the
[SPEAKER_01]: tastiest clone I've ever grown personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was probably like, I don't know,
seven or eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been chasing that flair ever
since and never got it to pop the turps
[SPEAKER_01]: like that one or two times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still super nice, but I know it has
the potential, but I guess I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: the skills to bring it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad you said that because I've had
a similar experience where I'm like
[SPEAKER_00]: chasing that first cycle with like a
different plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good to hear I'm not alone
because I sort of, I'm like, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was definitely a worse grower back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did I make it pop so hard?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess while we're on the topic of
maybe not being quite as good a grower and
[SPEAKER_00]: making things shine well, I'd love to talk
some of the early days of the BC growing
[SPEAKER_00]: life with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the point I'd like to start it
off with is I'd love to hear your
[SPEAKER_00]: experience because we have lots of chats
in the DMs and I value, how should I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like your perspectives are very
honest and unbiased.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to start off by asking,
you hear a lot of people talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: olden days of cannabis and like how it was
so much better, certain strains were just
[SPEAKER_00]: insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it really was like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think we have a bit of rose
shade glasses and you know, like good
[SPEAKER_00]: quality wasn't around as much,
all that sort of stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a hundred percent it's a million
times better today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a lot more varied back
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these days I do find it's like super
limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everything's kind of an OG or
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back then you really, there's
definitely some stuff when I look back and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, that was way different and
there's nothing around like it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also don't lose sight of the fact that
most of it was garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was both the stuff that people were
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could, like, I kind of got
started back in the, I've been around like
[SPEAKER_01]: since the late eighties, but I started
kind of in the growing scene in the early
[SPEAKER_01]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, back then nobody even tried,
hardly anyone even saved good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just popped a pack and whatever was
the biggest yielder, that was your keeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cause you could sell anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I did see some, there was
definitely some nice stuff, but it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say there was a whole lot of mids
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only ones that really, there's a
couple that stand out from back then,
[SPEAKER_01]: but honestly, like if I had to go back in
time, I can honestly think of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was an old NL clone that we used to
have that I would love to get back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen anything like that since.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some other good stuff,
but they're mostly still similar stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like, you know, some of the hazes
were nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can still get similar stuff today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the Northern light stuff was nice,
but to me, I just kind of think like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubba and stuff like that are basically
just modern day, modern lights of the type
[SPEAKER_01]: that I liked, but there was a lot of
garbage back then, honestly, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, people remember the good stuff,
but it was pretty dismal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good to hear that I haven't missed
the golden age of cannabis in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be curious to hear you mentioned
Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the questions I wanted to ask
you was back in like the nineties,
[SPEAKER_00]: say in the Pacific Northwest of the USA
when Northern lights and those sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: colors were really starting to take off,
did they just come up and cross the border
[SPEAKER_00]: around that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was there a bit of a delay before they
made their way up to you, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing they probably did,
but I think most of it was, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the exact dates,
but it was around like, when I kind of got
[SPEAKER_01]: into the growing scene, it was like
probably around 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was around it, but I really,
it was like 91 or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, I just remember when I
started, most of the stuff was second hand
[SPEAKER_01]: from seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like Neville stuff was what I
can tell it was like a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: ordered stuff in around 88 or so that type
of late eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they got shut down by the DA and
you couldn't get seeds anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all you got was basically whatever F2s
or clones getting passed around from
[SPEAKER_01]: people that had bought from the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was probably some stuff
around BC in that, that had come up from
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the reality, if you look back in
Canadian history, a huge portion of it was
[SPEAKER_01]: old seed bank genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also you got to remember where I kind
of been back and forth and I'm originally
[SPEAKER_01]: from like the Toronto area of Canada,
which is, it's kind of always our kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: crew was kind of half based in BC and half
based in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always bumped back and forth
between those two places, but I was mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: in Ontario around Toronto area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was super like the two different
regions of Canada and where I lived,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was super hardcore for like policing
and stuff for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people were pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there wasn't a whole lot of sharing
of anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like whatever was in your own crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then BC was a complete opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nobody had been put in jail in like a
decade or something for, for growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a bit of free for all, but even I
got the feeling like in BC, I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a ton of sharing outside of like
pretty tight networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even there, like you kept your,
your head down pretty good or it was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get lopped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, certainly it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be interested to ask like,
at what point do you think that the laws
[SPEAKER_00]: really started to relax on the East coast
or do you think they still haven't really
[SPEAKER_00]: caught up with the West coast?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is pretty relaxed now, but it's been
pretty recent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I remember even after legalization,
which I'm not like full legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even remember exactly when that
was probably about seven or eight years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in an area that's like a bit of the
big greenhouse area and there was some
[SPEAKER_01]: massive like legal cannabis places and I
own like a big property and the property
[SPEAKER_01]: was still getting flown by the police
looking for people growing plants in the
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard while there was like 20 acres of
legal weed, like a kilometer away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, those hobbits died,
died hard with the Ontario police force.
[SPEAKER_01]: These days it's a free for all,
but it took, it took a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to literally be like, like when
most of the time that I was growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you got caught with a single plant,
you were going to jail period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that sounds really brutal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it was, it was a war zone,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you hear about how the USA
historically had really harsh penalties,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I guess it's interesting to hear that
they weren't really too much different
[SPEAKER_00]: just over the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to ask you, if we roll back a
little bit, what was, I've always been
[SPEAKER_00]: interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did gorilla growing look like in
Canada back in like the eighties and
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties when people were just starting to
really grow flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I guess you hear about gorilla
growing in the States and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in Canada, the conditions are just
harsher, I imagine for a good chunk of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it really limited or like,
what was the limiting factor in your
[SPEAKER_00]: gorilla grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the stealth or the environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of Canada, basically like where I,
most of Canada, it's really situated along
[SPEAKER_01]: the US border of the population,
but there's a giant vast wilderness area,
[SPEAKER_01]: like pretty much wherever you live only a
couple of hours North.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was basically impossible to grow
along the Southern areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was, you just get either busted
or somebody would rip it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone kind of grew up in like the
wilderness areas and there you were really
[SPEAKER_01]: limited, especially back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing you remember about cannabis
or cannabis in Canada in that period is
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics were really locked down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you couldn't get any.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when I, just for reference,
when I started growing, you could not,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was illegal to buy anything telling you
how to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis, it was illegal to buy seeds
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was basically no place in the
world other than you literally had to fly
[SPEAKER_01]: to Amsterdam to get seeds and smuggle them
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically what you got is the
people that were in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, I mean, that's how our crew kind
of got started is we were the good
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and you just kept it on lockdown
and nobody, nobody else could get in,
[SPEAKER_01]: but especially the case with outdoor
genetics, because basically nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: finished out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to be out in a lot of areas,
but kind of third week of September was
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of the magic number and basically
nothing finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a couple of really crappy
Dutch strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really, it was all about,
that's kind of how I got into the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: What end of things was if you're in the
game, you had to like basically breed your
[SPEAKER_01]: own genetics because you couldn't get it
from anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the limiting factor and kind
of, you know, our crew kind of got into
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the earlier stuff was,
which was mostly of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The early stuff was based around a strain
called mighty might.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of like, depending on
the phenol, it was kind of an auto to semi
[SPEAKER_01]: auto one that would finish anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could also get it in before,
like it used to be back in the old days,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the end of the summer, through the
summer, there'd be no weed and you could,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you had weed, you could sell it for
really high prices really, really easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these strains kind of allowed you to
hit that, you know, get it in and also get
[SPEAKER_01]: it in before when all the mainstream stuff
started coming in, then the prices dropped
[SPEAKER_01]: and you could get in early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was definitely genetics and
willingness to do like hardcore stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: to pull it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some of the, I've seen some crazy
stuff to where we used to grow one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: places we literally used to like drive a
couple of hours and canoe about two hours
[SPEAKER_01]: into the wilderness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had like a grow out, we did grows
out in the swamps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could kind of water them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say swamp growing is one of the big
Canadian things because we've got plenty
[SPEAKER_01]: of swamps and no one in the right mind is
going to go in a Canadian swamp in the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the bugs were just, you know,
fears.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a nice little bit of a,
what would you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like human IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they said it was, that's like a
real Canadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Canadian gorilla was quite a
bit different than the US stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was, I don't know, it just seemed
a lot different because a you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: really small plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause in order for something to finish by
September 3rd, you weren't throwing like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, two pounders.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were more like quarter pound was a
good plant and it's mostly rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't dig anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you couldn't dig.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of the big problems is there's,
you couldn't dig a hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to basically either float
something on top of a swamp or they did a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of like whatever you put bushel
baskets on top of a swamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's self water or there's a bunch of
different methods, but it was always
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You stumbled, I stumbled across quite a
few, you know, wilderness gorilla grows
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's kind of before the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how you learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like how people, different people
do is by stumbling on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of patches back then and
stumble onto somebody else and go,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, I never thought of dropping bushel
baskets on my four wheeler and dropping it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a, on top of a wet part of a swamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like raised beds or there was other
ones on the scene on the East coast of
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada where we have these like kind of,
I don't know what the official name is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's like a floating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could actually, it's almost like
standing on a water bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like a surface layer of
soil and moss, and it's just floating over
[SPEAKER_01]: top of a pond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would grow on top of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would just, the roots would just
grow right down into the swamp,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the water roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of crazy methods and
probably a bunch of stuff I've never heard
[SPEAKER_01]: of before because everyone kept it tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, I'd be interested to hear the,
the terroir and the five or the swamp weed
[SPEAKER_00]: literally sounds fun, but I'd love to ask
you, we had a white Buffalo on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: recently and they referenced an early
Canadian strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't, I've heard of it, but I'm not as
familiar with it as I should be,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'd love to hear if you have any
experience with it, the old spice of life,
[SPEAKER_00]: creme sodaka.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have much interaction with that
one at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I actually grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, that was in my opinion,
one of, I think it kind of became an
[SPEAKER_01]: important building block, but honestly,
like just to clarify, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the Canadian outdoor weed has
never been that great with the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in, in some parts of Canada,
you can grow some like kind of more
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor, like regular strains, but most
parts of Canada, when you're limited to
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, for instance, like if you grow
like, I don't know, like a Bubba or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, I personally,
there's like a lot of decent weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't smoked a whole lot of like
really good Canadian outdoor short season
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say no offense to Frieder
Steve, but creme sodaka would fall into
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that probably, so that was like a
early, like it's a purple one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of some of the earlier
stuff we were working with, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I used to work with outdoor
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw this purple stuff that came out of
Holland and it was pretty horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it didn't taste that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't get you that high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking the purple, the creme
sodaka was one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of put it in perspective,
Frieder Steve, when he released it,
[SPEAKER_01]: he immediately pulled it off the market
and kind of regretted it because even
[SPEAKER_01]: though it was a, I think a good like
production strain, it was definitely like
[SPEAKER_01]: lacking in some of those other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, while we're on the topic of
purple cannabis, you mentioned the purple
[SPEAKER_00]: kush earlier and you said it was a
Canadian favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got my brain juices sort of pumping
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had remembered that it was a popular one
in Canada, but I was interested to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you know which cutting of the purple
kush that is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know there's a few and I think the
popular one is like the SR whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it that one or a different one as far
as you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a couple that particular,
that's like a seed line that I run and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's actually based off of a Garberville
one which is Garberville purple kush,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is one that came, which isn't so
it's a California one, not a Canadian one,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's been around Canada for probably
like, I don't know when I first saw it
[SPEAKER_01]: early 2000s or so supposedly got smuggled
up in the door of somebody's car that was
[SPEAKER_01]: fleeing California on charges.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a couple, so purple kush is
kind of a weird Canadian thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, a lot of the purple kush we
have up here isn't actually purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was kind of a, I'm trying to think
this early, kind of weird, especially BC
[SPEAKER_01]: where on the commercial scene,
it was really like, it would be like all
[SPEAKER_01]: one clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be like for like a few years,
I think White Buffalo kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's like these eras and it was like in
the early 2000s, it was like purple kush
[SPEAKER_01]: and everybody was growing purple kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a few different types,
but it was mostly one clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was another era,
it was like the hash plant era.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if you go back earlier,
it was the, there was a Northern lights
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and a big bud and purple kush was a
long, pretty long standing era in the
[SPEAKER_01]: early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they talked to one guy who I'm pretty
sure is the kind of source for,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was actually a California broker
that smuggled up the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was kind of during that OG
kush era.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was actually a kush, we call it
purple kush, but when I've grown out S1s
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff, it pops out OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was basically the first OG
kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look like an OG kush,
but when you taste it, you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's got that kush funk to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you pop seed lines out of it,
not the garber bill, that's a separate
[SPEAKER_01]: one, but the main one that everyone,
I just call it the BC purple kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main one that everyone was
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one I'm pretty convinced was an
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've talked to the, actually talked to
the broker that supposedly brought it up
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm pretty sure it probably came from
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he told me it was a Hollywood purple
kush cross with bubba, which I've never
[SPEAKER_01]: even heard of a Hollywood purple kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of wonder if it's the Hollywood
pure kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, he was a big broker and he was
back in the first early days of that thing
[SPEAKER_01]: in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the BC growers, it was an
export market, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So brought up this cut and gave it to a
bunch of organized crime gangs to grow for
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this whole story totally, I was like,
everything like matched.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've laid that, that's probably what it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it matches what the S1s and crosses
that have grown out come from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing special.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing I was finding funny
about the Canadian purple kush is a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: them didn't really go super purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of have like a little bit of
purple in the calyxes or if you really
[SPEAKER_01]: drop the temperature, it would be like
lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it sounded a lot like the Urkel story
from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many interesting talking points
you dropped there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I've certainly heard of the
Garberville purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Gene, well known breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses that in his work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely some established provenance
behind that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so stoked that you referenced that a
lot of the purple kush doesn't go purple
[SPEAKER_00]: because one of, not the very first,
because I've told this story on other
[SPEAKER_00]: podcasts, like the first good weed I ever
had that really got my mind ticking about
[SPEAKER_00]: weed was some green granddaddy purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the second or third strain I got to
try that was really good was some green
[SPEAKER_00]: purple kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always looked back on it and was
like, fuck, that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, but I don't know if it was actually
purple kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just realised it actually,
like my mate did tell me he got it from
[SPEAKER_00]: like an online Canadian weed seller or
whatever back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like it could well be similar because
it was definitely nice stuff, but that's
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've pulled a lot of those sort of
stories together for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to sort of move to a topic
that's hard to get a lot of info about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned it yourself, that the hash
plant era, it seems like pink kush has
[SPEAKER_00]: been popular for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what White Buffalo told us,
those hash plants and pink kushes are sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of from the same era.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your perspective and recollection
on the hash plant era, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hash plant era kind of start like
right from this, I remember back when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was in like university and like the 90s,
early 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can remember some of those cuts,
like champagne was one of them that came
[SPEAKER_01]: out of that same group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like biker cuts, I think is the,
all the, all the stories point back
[SPEAKER_01]: towards a group of bikers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And champagne was probably the most elite
cut back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we'd never seen anything like it at
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was going around back then,
but it really kind of blew up where we
[SPEAKER_01]: had, I think it was the early medical days
and there was you could get, I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember if it was like there was
mandatory minimums around 10 plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if it was, you could get a medical card
for 10 plants, but for a while it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: these crazy scenes where they would like
drop down these vertical, they're called
[SPEAKER_01]: biker buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be like a hempy bucket or whatever
they call it, like a big five gallon pail
[SPEAKER_01]: and some hydro corn and a super high
powered bubbler in the bottom and with
[SPEAKER_01]: like coolers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like really high tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they would drop these vertical
thousand watt bulbs and they'd have one
[SPEAKER_01]: bulb per plant and grow these massive,
massive beasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there'd be commercial grows that had
10 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to yield in them,
there was only a couple of strains that
[SPEAKER_01]: could actually do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and one was a, it was a hash plant
and the other one was like a BC big,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't, I think the hash plant was
decent quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: The BC big blood cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was their claim to fame.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to grow the 10 plants,
you had to grow like one of these handful
[SPEAKER_01]: of clones, anything else you'd get like,
you know, three quarters of pound of light
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So champagne is an interesting one from a
few perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I feel like you don't hear about
it as much as say the King, but I have
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly heard about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like a, like a kush sort of plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: I never tried it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going back quite a ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, I consider most of those more
of like, I kind of differentiate hash
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and kushes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find like kushes are kind of more,
the more modern like OG type.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's not traditional,
obviously kushes or could be anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I consider those ones more like of a
pure hash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't have, they just tasted like
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like that new, it wasn't like
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big hash plant guy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had kind of up until OG kush and the
purple cushion stuff kind of committed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's my preference for effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm stuck smoking stuff that doesn't
taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: That great because it was just not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just tasted like hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what champagne is kind of like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked good in a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It yielded good, but I would consider it
just like a pretty generic, high quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: but generic hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you ever grow any of these cuts
yourself in the early days or were they so
[SPEAKER_00]: tightly held that like, you just sort of
got buds of them here and there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, definitely not in the early days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a, I've grown, I'd say most
of what's going around up until like the
[SPEAKER_01]: last decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, I got whatever cuts were going
through my kind of extended crew,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was pretty like, it was a tight
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these, I was like rolling with since
like the, since my university days,
[SPEAKER_01]: like since the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those guys were pretty
connected and I'd get whatever they
[SPEAKER_01]: happened to be, which is usually some of
the good commercial cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the stuff was locked down
pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it wasn't, up until pretty
recently, but I did grow a lot of like
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like the grapefruit was the real
famous clone back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could have actually could have
gotten a few times, but I've grown out a
[SPEAKER_01]: crap load of grapefruit crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a good feeling of what,
okay, what grapefruit is like just from
[SPEAKER_01]: growing out 50 or 60 seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the same thing with the hash
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely, I had a bunch of them in
like the actual clone and from
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stuff that I've never, never grown any
of, any of those coveted ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never really grown myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like you still have a really
diverse range of experience, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of curiosity, did you ever try any of
that fabled breeder Steve DJ short collab
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, or was that more of like a seed
release?
[SPEAKER_00]: They did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't necessarily like stuff
passed out to locals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have tried some of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the funny thing about Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know whether it's actually true,
but people are always between,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Ontario and DC, especially most
people live in kind of three main parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know whether that's actually
true in Canada, but definitely within the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed scene, you were never more than about
three people removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of had, I actually had like two
groups, separate groups of friends that
[SPEAKER_01]: were all like one person removed from that
breeder Steve crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually one of my friends was
actually involved in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually tried the, it was something
crushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't really think it was blue crush or
something came out of that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the actual name,
but it was crushed for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a giant blueberry DJ short fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly respectable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my taste of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did try some of that and it actually
grew some of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, sorry, I did, I know that I
think back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew a bunch of, I think I grew a bunch
of time or crossed with that blue,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, true blue blueberry male.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used in that, that actually came from
Reddit legend seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew that outdoor for a few years too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely tried a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just mentioned legend seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people are probably
unaware that DJ did that collab with them
[SPEAKER_00]: and a few cool lesser known strains came
out of it, like, you know, red eye bride
[SPEAKER_00]: and a few other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Toe jam and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever have much of a positive
impression from those ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how come you think they don't get
recognized as much?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're gonna remember about that
time and frame in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: The export market was all about it had to
look a certain way, almost no hairs,
[SPEAKER_01]: really dumb criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think back, it was like,
it had to be super light green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was the main limit that exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of that was to me, that was like
commercial weed is decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's definitely good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really, I grew a bunch of it and
it wasn't something that I would keep
[SPEAKER_01]: around personally, but it was definitely
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that you've done, um,
some different cultivation writing over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years for cannabis Canada and cannabis
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that experience like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And would you ever consider doing more of
that sort of creative writing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that was a moment in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically going to my, my history is
that I always worked in the uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: since I was a little kid, I worked in like
the commercial greenhouse industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was kind of, I went to kind of the
top ag or top ag or horticulture school in
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of at that time I was
doing like a lot of dead shows and I was,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, so I was hanging out with like kind of
dead, dead crowd in that university.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my roommates was a big
wholesaler and I think just the,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was like the Holy Trinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whatever you call it of things where
that my friend, the wholesaler kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: knew everybody in town.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our house was kind of like a,
I don't know what you'd call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like anything good weed wise was coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was coming through town was through our
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so all the growers would come there
and he just kind of knew everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all through like the dead scene
largely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and just because I had all that
commercial greenhouse experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of always got sucked in with a lot
of those guys because I kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, came from commercial,
uh, greenhouse flowers and veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out of there, somehow I ended up
working on the side for, uh, cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada, which was part of the time it was
the same magazine, cannabis, cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada had turned into cannabis culture
eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really like an activist
magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was back in like the dark days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You weren't allowed to really do anything
there and love him or hate him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mark Emory was the guy that owned that
magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did, I don't particularly like the
guy, but, uh, he, there's no question he
[SPEAKER_01]: did a lot of major bid for Canada's
cannabis laws and some, and some other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he was really pushing the boundaries
and that was his magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where, if you hear people
talking about Emory seeds and that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: all sold out of the magazine, but it was
very much like, uh, uh, it was an activist
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was really about, you gotta
remember that, that, if you frame that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think a lot of people realize,
but at that point in time, BC specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: was kind of with BC and Amsterdam were the
two epicenters of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the, in the world, California was still
really, this is kind of like late
[SPEAKER_01]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, California was still locked down
pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone was not, it wasn't even though
it was a major player, nobody was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about any international scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, BC was kind of the centric and
Mark Henry's kind of a big egomaniac.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's kind of used that to promote his
stuff, but I'm super proud of being
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it really pushed the boundaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so basically kind of my niche
there was I kind of just took what I was
[SPEAKER_01]: learning from working in work,
going to school and being in the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial industry, mostly from being in
the commercial greenhouse industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting it into cannabis and just taking
like, I kind of brought like diff was a
[SPEAKER_01]: new thing back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of, you know, write an article
at diff and, uh, a bunch of stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but basically taking just general
horticulture things that was kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: forefront of the, you know, floriculture
vegetable industry and bringing it into
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the same time, Mark Henry had
this giant seed catalog, which was at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time, the only place in the world that you
could buy cannabis seeds from without
[SPEAKER_01]: flying to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like this real hot, um,
commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, who knows how much money he made
off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely a lot, but, uh, yeah,
that magazine, I mean, high times was
[SPEAKER_01]: always the biggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were the next biggest room up
to like quite a few million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the circulation,
but it was a substantial circulation all
[SPEAKER_01]: through the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that was kind of, but as that,
I was thinking it was a moment of time
[SPEAKER_01]: where a lot of that stuff, it was kind of
before the internet was big, internet was
[SPEAKER_01]: around, but a lot of that stuff just got
replaced by, it was good information at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time that I was putting out,
but it really quickly got replaced by like
[SPEAKER_01]: overgrow and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, it was a crazy,
it was a crazy time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we had kind of reached a crescendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was 2003 or 2004 that this kind
of gives you an idea of like who he sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of running this for.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just total activists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Dana Larson is the guy that I really
have a huge amount of respect for that
[SPEAKER_01]: nobody talks about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, he's the biggest activist in
Canada ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just kind of, you know,
kept his head down a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it kind of reached this, uh,
crescendo when at the time the DEA had
[SPEAKER_01]: just opened up an office in Canada because
they were concerned with all the exporting
[SPEAKER_01]: going on and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'd opened up a, uh, office in
Vancouver, which is where cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_01]: at the time was called was based and Mark
Emery and Dana, and I can't remember a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of other people from the magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the drug czar had actually come up to
Vancouver and was going to give like a
[SPEAKER_01]: drug czar, whatever speech or something
like a private function.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys actually bought a table at
it without people realizing there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of activists in the front row and
heckled the drug czar through the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the time when I definitely
regretted being part of that organization
[SPEAKER_01]: because I didn't sign up for heckling the
drug czar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so the drug czar was at the time
that I don't think knew who any of them
[SPEAKER_01]: were, even though Mark Emery was shipping
seeds all over the U S like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, from what I can piece together,
went home and said, who the heck are these
[SPEAKER_01]: people that heckled me through the whole
thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, Oh, that's, you know,
Mark Emery and Dana Larson, the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: seed sellers in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they sell over America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they started a big DEA, you know,
investigation of the whole magazine
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine organization that ended up in,
uh, Mark Emery going to jail and a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of, uh, crazy stuff that went around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anyone knows exactly what
happened, but it was definitely a little
[SPEAKER_01]: heart raising.
[SPEAKER_01]: I added, I had a situation at that time,
like I'm sure it's not, I'm still not
[SPEAKER_01]: positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what's happened, but I'm pretty sure
it's what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the time, like I said, I was based
in, uh, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the articles I was writing were
coming from, uh, we're just being
[SPEAKER_01]: transmitted digitally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time we didn't, I just knew
they'd done this thing with the drugs are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, like, I don't like the
sounds of that, but nothing, everything
[SPEAKER_01]: was kind of going smoothly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been operating for quite a few
years with no hassles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, all this wonky stuff
started coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was going back and forth between
Dana was the editor at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was sending him articles and he kept
coming back and going, I didn't get the
[SPEAKER_01]: article.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this bunch of wonky stuff where we
couldn't transmit emails, which looking
[SPEAKER_01]: back was clearly, we know that the DEA was
on the servers, like looking through
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure it was something to do with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I used to send them all through,
uh, like from an internet, whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: call them cafe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it couldn't get traced to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was usually, I was pretty paranoid
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always move around a little bit,
but I guess, I don't know, I get
[SPEAKER_01]: complacent and I kept every Friday
afternoon or not every, but that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like a specific time, kind of,
you know, whatever four o'clock on a
[SPEAKER_01]: Friday afternoon, I'd stop by the same
internet cafe and transmit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The article or whatever we were
communicating about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so one day I'm sitting there and
I was the only person in the cafe and all
[SPEAKER_01]: of a sudden bang, the door comes open and
this cop looking guy comes in and he walks
[SPEAKER_01]: right past, you know, the 50 computer
terminals and goes right to me and like
[SPEAKER_01]: looks over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, that seems a little
sketch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he laughed and I was like,
okay, well, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was probably being paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, two minutes later, Ben and he
comes again with another guy that looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like a pop and they come straight for my,
like where I'm sitting, there's nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: else there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of got up and super paranoid
back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was, I was, uh, parked about three
parking lots away in kind of a busy area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just, I first started walking and
I was like, Holy cow, like they're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually like coming after me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it ended up with me running through
this parking lot, you know, dodging cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was in a movie with these two,
you know, undercover cop looking people
[SPEAKER_01]: chasing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got away and thought it's kind of
like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sure felt like that was like the DEA or
something, but it seemed so crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like be staking at an internet cafe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then like two weeks later,
they arrested, they took down Mark Emory
[SPEAKER_01]: and arrested him and extradited him and a
bunch of other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it probably was, but we'll
never know for sure, but it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, something I'm totally proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was instrumental in changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Canada and the U S laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always a big believer in genetics of
just that was always the limiting factor
[SPEAKER_01]: of there wasn't enough genetics or at the
time, know-how of how to grow stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really believed in just spreading
genetics, spreading the know-how of how to
[SPEAKER_01]: do stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think that in the U S that's
under, I don't think they realized how
[SPEAKER_01]: much that probably made a difference
because you couldn't get seeds other than
[SPEAKER_01]: from that organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really, for I don't know how many
years, it's probably like six or seven
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really just flooded the world with high
quality, um, cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm super proud of the super proud of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super proud of really being associated
with Mark Emory, but whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: he did some good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that like, uh, for a good
chunk of time, say five, six years,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you said, um, you know, Mark was really
the one flooding the world with genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'd be interested to hear,
do you feel like a lot of what he stocked
[SPEAKER_00]: was good quality and was what it says it
was?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I always remember back to that Brita
Steve story where he rocks up with the
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet skunk and Mark was like,
whatever, we'll just call it sensey big
[SPEAKER_00]: bud or like sweet skunk or like whatever
it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe it was a bit more like,
you know, just whack a name on whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: or like, what was your take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it was pretty above board or
it was a bit like just whatever works?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think it was a bit of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was mostly, uh, like,
so how that started from what I remember
[SPEAKER_01]: is Mark, he was originally, everything was
just coming out Amsterdam and he had a
[SPEAKER_01]: guy, um, I won't say his name,
but there was a guy that was working over
[SPEAKER_01]: that there was living over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of, uh, um, I don't know
what exactly he was doing there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he was shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just buying seeds and, and moving
them to Mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he was just reselling,
you know, like at the time it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: Sagamatha and sensey and, uh, Dutch Pat,
all the original kind of Dutch ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that guy was actually one of the
guys that came back, I believe,
[SPEAKER_01]: and started the BC seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a bunch of stuff like that,
but there was a whole lot of knockoffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was basically Mark started off
selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Dutch genetics and any,
I think just figured, Oh crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, um, just knock off this stuff and
then sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody really cared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people didn't really know enough to
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just were like, Oh, it's Northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah, I think a whole lot of it
was just like F2s from a 10 pack,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there was definitely some good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like reader Steve definitely did some real
work, but I mean, to put it in context,
[SPEAKER_01]: I always not said at the, at the time,
I remember like, this is way back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: early days when Steve first getting
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember we kind of used to laugh at
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it had in the, in the write-up,
it was like, you know, his breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: operation under two, 400 watt lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it literally said it in the,
in the breeding, in the company
[SPEAKER_01]: description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so that's how stuff started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he definitely, you know, just breeder
Steve, I think the guy did some,
[SPEAKER_01]: some massive work, but that was kind of
the context is like, how big were these
[SPEAKER_01]: places?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the average size for grows back then
was tiny compared to what we're used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where I was from, like before lighter
was pretty much as much as most people ran
[SPEAKER_01]: 10, 10 lights was definitely, unless you
were like organized crime, a 10 lighter
[SPEAKER_01]: was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you are out in BC,
10 lighters were a little bit more common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was definitely like some 30 or
40 and some big ones, but I would say the
[SPEAKER_01]: average grow at that time in Canada was
four lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, how much breeding was
actually, you know, how much real breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: was actually going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think there was definitely some
interesting stuff came out of there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there was also a ton of like just,
um, knockoffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came out of pretty small population
sizes, but I would say like, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely some unique Canadian genetics
that got spread around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like mighty might that I already talked to
that came out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Texas out of time work, which is a,
you know, was a super to me, instrumental
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor strain, um, UBC chemo,
which was one of the early that pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: sure it was like a Canadian bread,
you know, not related to Dutch genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely some interesting stuff
that came out of there and got spread
[SPEAKER_01]: through that seed bank for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was also a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of just generic crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of great stuff came out of
that generic crap too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've, I grew out the best Northern
lights I've ever, um, grown just came out
[SPEAKER_01]: of one of those packs and I'm sure it was
just a F2 from Neville stuff or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of curiosity, have you been
following any of the Northern lights
[SPEAKER_00]: re-releases from say Todd McCormick or
inspector slash Matt ride and have they
[SPEAKER_00]: piqued your interest at all or not
particularly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, I followed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested, but I also remember,
I think people realize one of those ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that people view through rose colored
glasses that most Northern lights at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time it was, it was totally like the,
what did they call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The state of the art modern indoor Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, but if you compare it,
if I had to take most of the most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern lights was pretty generic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm really interested to see what
comes out of that because I definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: tried some, a couple of really good
Northern lights, but I also, I grew a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of different Northern lights during that
early nineties period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of them were just, we'd call them
mids these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they weren't anything special.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just like the ash ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm interested to see what comes
out of that, but I know I'm not buying any
[SPEAKER_01]: backs of seeds anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Hey, you've just piqued my
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I, uh, it is a weird situation,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I put a gun to your head and I
said, you have to buy a pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, like what ones are you going to
get like in terms of like, what,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would you get if you were going to
get one?
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what interests you right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I really, I'm actually a fan of like
some of the stuff, CSI Humboldt got going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really a, I love that elite currently
elite or elite clone S1 stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably try like, um, probably maybe
some of the, I'm kind of like not the dog
[SPEAKER_01]: headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the sound of some of the headbands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried some really good headbands and
you gotta remember in Canada, it's gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot better, but we generally don't get
most of the elite clones are our BS,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's a cookies clone and you get
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, this is anything even
remotely cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's gotten better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's gotten illegal that some of the
real cuts are going over, but generally we
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't get any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've tried a lot of cam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never tried the actual clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried a lot of girl scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never tried the actual girl scout
cookies clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I could, might've,
might've, there's a lot of stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I was going to buy seeds,
it'd probably be something like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: A headband, um, maybe one of the a five
type things it's going on a five haze,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it would probably be like a headband
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, also one of the articles,
the one I've never tried that I've always
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to is a, is some of the articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'd really like to see how that
relates to a lot of the Canada purple
[SPEAKER_01]: cushions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I would lay bets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: CSI has been doing some cool stuff with
his FEM stuff and I myself have a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: the, uh, the headband cross lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Headband cross Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on the same page, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was specifically the one that I would
probably go for if I had to, but I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: buy a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get, I'll never go through all the seeds
I have in a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, I just basically go through
clones and stuff that gets gifted to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to hear that you got a nice
little stash there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could just loop back to a point you
made a bit earlier, um, just to clarify
[SPEAKER_00]: for myself and anyone listening,
um, it sounds like you're sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: thought that, uh, that, that heckling with
that drugs are at that talk may have been
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, the sort of catalyst that
started the whole demise of Mark Emory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that sort of what you're getting at?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no quite, if you look at the
timeframe, it was literally a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what, uh, happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no doubt at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was some other stuff,
which I don't want to get into cause it's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of hearsay, but I wouldn't be
surprised if there was actually like an
[SPEAKER_01]: undercover agent and dropped into that
organization at that time too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, I don't think most people
realize like how much of a threat that
[SPEAKER_01]: group was really perceived by the DEA at
the time, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but no, there was zero doubt that
heckling the drugs are absolutely was the
[SPEAKER_01]: start of Mark Emory's demise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit brazen, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, interesting stuff to
hear for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something which we hear a lot about in
the American history is how beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: that the forums were to the scene,
how it promoted a lot of sharing of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really heard a perspective on
how it affected the Canadian scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that largely speaking,
it was the same as the U S in that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like groundbreaking, you know,
you could get all this info, people
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing genetics, or would you say like
less so of an effect than what the U S
[SPEAKER_00]: saw?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the information was definitely
groundbreaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was, I can totally remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was kind of around since the,
I was never a giant forum dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I was, I was on there and I was right
from the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I literally remember, I can remember
the first one over grow launched.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember being, there used to be another
forum called, I think it was called weed
[SPEAKER_01]: base and it was on a server.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was on something called
laughing moon, which was, I believe owned
[SPEAKER_01]: by advanced nutrients at the time before
they were advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a real low key forum,
but that was the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the biggest cannabis forum in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember going on there one day and
there was a post that said, you're all
[SPEAKER_01]: going to jail, um, read this and get out
or something like something crazy where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, and it was, I think you're
paranoid back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I remember clicking on it and it was
shebang that basically was the guy that
[SPEAKER_01]: started over grow was who posted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, don't hold me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure it was shebang.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was directing you to this new site
over grow.com and saying, this was the
[SPEAKER_01]: safe place to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember going on it then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could literally go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was at the time that I was kind
of writing for cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you wanted to like keep up on all the
latest, what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember over grow was so small at
that time that I could click through in
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, 45 minutes and check every
post that had gone on like that week or
[SPEAKER_01]: something in all the different
subheadings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then within like, from what I'm
remembering, it was literally like a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just like exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you couldn't even like follow the posts
in like one sub forum in a evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there was a ton of information
cause that was just, that was the first,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone was locked in their own little
bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my whole cannabis world back then was
about 10 people, maybe 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you didn't even tell, like you can
even tell like your best friends that you
[SPEAKER_01]: grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was, it was really tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the internet was kind of this
weird thing where you could tell it just
[SPEAKER_01]: gave some anonymity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd be like, Holy cow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these other people are doing this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I would say for me, I was already,
cause I was always kind of on a dead tour
[SPEAKER_01]: during that time period or just in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I already had connections with way more
people than the average growers had
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'd meet all these Americans on,
you know, on dead tour that were,
[SPEAKER_01]: were into weed, but the average person
like you, like whatever a couple of your
[SPEAKER_01]: local crew and, and that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, that was absolutely game-changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I basically that's that in the DEA
involvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason I stopped writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was like, this is irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once overgrow blew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this writing is totally
irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It basically made magazines like that
become like, you know, reader's digest or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but no, I think they were absolutely,
and I personally, when I look back on that
[SPEAKER_01]: time period, I think two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Affected cannabis laws more than anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was the internet specifically like
overgrow cannabis world, that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, just spreading the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two was people like Mark Henry seeds,
just dosing the world with high quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly think those were the two
pivotal things that pushed legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of curiosity, do you believe that
the forums would ever be able to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: comeback?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen a lot of people pushing for it
and a lot of people criticize the sort of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, constant feed of Instagram,
but at the same time, it doesn't seem like
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the forums have really got a lot of
traction taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think we'll ever go back or do you
think Instagram sort of here to stay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we'll ever go back to the
forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do definitely miss parts of it where it
definitely, um, I don't like the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: with Instagram where stuff goes through so
quickly where you used to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance, I know that there's a thread
on purple push there that I always
[SPEAKER_01]: remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, that was like classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a bunch of them like that,
but they were just classic threads where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, it was like a thing on BC
purple push.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a bunch of people,
you know, posting and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was sitting there, you know,
active for probably a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got some good information on it
where now if you said something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like it's a 24 hour discussion and
then it's, it's just gone into the IG
[SPEAKER_01]: abyss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I have a, I kind of feel like it
was a moment in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still like go on there every once
in a while and there's still some
[SPEAKER_01]: discussions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it's kind of some of the
older dudes that never moved on to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be cool to see them come back,
but I'm not entirely sold myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but given we are in the sort of modern
legal, uh, climate, it'd be good to talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you've transitioned your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over to the legal market, working in the
Canadian cannabis industry, shall we call
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what's that transition been like for
you as someone who historically was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, doing their own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and now suddenly to be working around
people, it's all legal out in the open.
[SPEAKER_00]: How has that been for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that a lot of the American
guys, especially some of the big players,
[SPEAKER_00]: even to this day, they still really
struggle to sort of act in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: reflects how legal it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're always still like sort
of looking over their shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big fan of the commercial world
because of just the experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say you've had a similar
experience or is it a bit more casual for
[SPEAKER_00]: you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to be clear, like I kind of
haven't been in a commercial scene for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of one of those people that I've
been around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most people know me just cause
I've been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, and I rolled with a lot of some of
my friends were pretty, um, hardcore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always kind of kept my head down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a long time since I was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actively involved in the, in the
commercial scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my kind of thing is I've kind of always
been around it on different levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I've never been like, it's been a
long time since I've been like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, a baller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I've kind of, I've worked in the
green as industry on both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've kind of seen watch this kind of,
I think, uh, what's it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Arms length observer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't, I didn't really have anything
invested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't taking, I wasn't making a
living from the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wasn't hurting me seeing the legal
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I like, I really like seeing people not
going to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think you can't lose sight of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen so many people's lives over the
time, just completely destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one of my second, my second closest
friend committed suicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, um, as far as I'm concerned as
a fallout from being arrested and just
[SPEAKER_01]: having for growing at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a 600 water and he was on the front
page of the, like basically a personal
[SPEAKER_01]: growth front page of the newspaper for a
week or two, the tax people coming out by
[SPEAKER_01]: haunting them for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they destroyed his life over a 600
watt, um, garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he ended up killing himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw so many stories like that,
that I just think it's important that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone keeps that in the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of lives ruined.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still people sitting in jail for
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I just, I do find it, it doesn't,
there's a lot of stuff that I don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of said I work, um, I don't work
for one of the facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of work in like supplying and
consulting some of the facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've seen pretty much most of them
across Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing I think that stands out the
most to me is what saddens me about it is
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in BC, there's a lot of cool
places to live in British Columbia,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, like that don't have any jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but traditionally, like basically
since back in, you know, back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: seventies, but especially since like the
late eighties when the indoor stuff took
[SPEAKER_01]: off, that's what paid for people to live
in these beautiful spots, like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Kootenays, which is like the interior BC
or up on the sunshine coast, which is like
[SPEAKER_01]: North of Vancouver or Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no jobs there, but you could
make a living running a 10 lighter or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty much done.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still people doing it,
but it's getting really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I find is that saddens me for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that was a really great part
of like Canadian culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've seen, I've seen firsthand in
some of those areas that were kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: black market centric spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the big, uh, licensed producer
opens up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys went from making,
you know, a lot of people weren't getting
[SPEAKER_01]: rich in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were making like, you know,
80 or a hundred thousand dollars a year or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that tax free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden they're making,
you know, $50,000 and paying tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their wages just kind of got cut in a
quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, this is the money's
not going into the local economy anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: The money's going somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that I really find, um,
saddening, but, um, overall, like I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty positive about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it kind of went through a bit of a
dead zone off the start where it just went
[SPEAKER_01]: really corporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's kind of a second wave
coming where I've got like, I've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of good buddies that run licensed
places that are doing okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like legit dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they, I think they really love what
they're doing and they're not super
[SPEAKER_01]: corporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least nobody's going to jail anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, uh, actually a really relevant
point I've been trying to talk to people
[SPEAKER_00]: about, because you see a lot of sentiment
these days about people feeling really
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated that, uh, as you said,
you know, they can no longer pull a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred K from their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them get really frustrated
about that and complain about the laws
[SPEAKER_00]: and, oh, we should have never gone legal,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you said, at the end of the day,
keeping people out of jail or sadly,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the case of your friend, you know,
committing suicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know that that's not entirely
related, but keeping people out of jail
[SPEAKER_00]: should be the number one metric of
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it is unfortunate that people's
livelihoods are affected, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, yeah, it is good that we can hopefully
keep people from being put in prison for
[SPEAKER_00]: just growing a plant really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you got to keep it in
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, why were people able to go make,
you know, make a whole bunch of money,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, living in some cool spot where
there's no jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because that's what you were paying
for, you know, the risk and the risk is
[SPEAKER_01]: gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it wasn't because they were master
growers or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the time it was because they
were, you know, risking going to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of them lost,
um, you know, lost sight of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you saw a lot of people that also,
you know, I have a couple of friends that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're kind of genetics geeks
and they've always got all the most elite
[SPEAKER_01]: clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they really thought everybody
and they do have some of the nicest weed
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they really thought everybody
was buying from them because they had,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, these super elite cuts and they
were great grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they found it real quick was
90% of the people were buying from them
[SPEAKER_01]: because they had wheat and there was a lot
of people just don't care about me as much
[SPEAKER_01]: as you or I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just like, whatever's
cheapest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those guys went down pretty,
uh, pretty quick side, but whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, that's kind of what the world's
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, it's about evolving
with the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still see a lot of people who are
able to, you know, um, diversify their
[SPEAKER_00]: income streams and still stay in the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be interested in hearing that you
referenced how some of the big,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, companies that initially invested in
the Canadian scene, uh, sort of went
[SPEAKER_00]: defunct and now there's like this second
wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it like now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that a lot of the big ag has
realized, look, we can't just come in here
[SPEAKER_00]: and make a bajillion dollars like we were
hoping to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a sort of a technically
challenging operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that we're going to see like
a scaled back corporate version of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that people will come in,
buy out these defunct facilities that are
[SPEAKER_00]: now for sale, like, you know, pennies on
the dollar and they'll try to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you foresee the Canadians in going
forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think I'll probably be driving
around showing my grandkids one day,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's rusted out old greenhouses and
warehouses and telling them the story
[SPEAKER_01]: about how this, you know, the crazy
cannabis boom that never really
[SPEAKER_01]: materialized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think just to be clear, if you can
look at what actually happened in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of it wasn't big egg money or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was investment money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, um, like the,
the, you know, some of those big ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, um, they came on and it was,
uh, it was, it was investment thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, for instance, the town that I
grew up in, um, or didn't grow up,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've lived in for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was a big facility opened up
there and people started in bed and I knew
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of people that literally became
like billionaires or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: invested, you know, a hundred thousand
dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden they're sitting on 1.2
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they just blew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all their friends are like,
Holy cow, like Neil, this made a million
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars on the $30 million investment with
this LP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they all invested their money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really driven by just the
average person all trying to cash in on
[SPEAKER_01]: this jackpot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I was one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a bunch of money off the start and
I lost it off the longterm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that's kind of what drove it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a lot of like big money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a whole bunch of average Joe's
dumping their money and not knowing what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're investing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think what happened is these
people just had, you know, he was,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember, I never followed it that
closely, but it was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the one place, you know,
just one of their facilities was worth
[SPEAKER_01]: $150 billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had like, you know, three of that
size and all of them are shuttered,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there was just, it didn't make any
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I remember, um, myself and one of the
other guys had kind of been around not
[SPEAKER_01]: from the cannabis world, but just in that,
you know, the horticulture greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: world for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were doing the math and I was like,
I dunno, I'm thinking maybe 40 acres could
[SPEAKER_01]: supply all of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was, I think at one point we
were like over a thousand or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't make any sense, but nobody was
really thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just like, well, we've got,
you know, a billion dollars to spend that
[SPEAKER_01]: all these investors gave us that we better
spend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were trying to, I think there was
a lot of fight for whoever had the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: production space was going to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's really proved out is those
people all failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the second wave is kind of still
investors, but it's a lot of stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: oil and gas decided to, you know,
put, you know, put some money into these
[SPEAKER_01]: much smaller facilities or some of the,
um, the first nations, um, like the native
[SPEAKER_01]: Indian bands, you know, have some cash
have put it in more stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're much more realistic,
like they're smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're not so ridiculous with all the
regulations and it makes much more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second wave, but I think for sure,
a lot of that first wave is just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: like rust or maybe it was going to grow
cucumbers or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what they're going to do
with some of those facilities,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely like, it was kind of
like the gold boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That type of thing happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking.com boom, but you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the gold rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or.com or.com same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of parallels there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess from your sort of professional
experience, when you go to large
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities, what are some of the big
issues you see that are stopping them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not the ones you visit, but just in
general, like what are some of the hurdles
[SPEAKER_00]: that a large producers going to come
across that are going to get in the way of
[SPEAKER_00]: them producing top quality product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm assuming they're all coming in
going, yeah, you know, we're going to run
[SPEAKER_00]: these greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all going to be like the triple A
plus the best on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe it doesn't pan out that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the issues they have to
overcome?
[SPEAKER_01]: The issues now are a bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like before they first started,
you'd go in and you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they literally didn't have a clue
what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them, um, like it was horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now I would say most of them are
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue that I see the most is it's just
age.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the, the pro it's the difference
between all the black market guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: not to diss my black market brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but they're all, you know,
those legal guys don't know what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, I'm like, I've been in the black
market guys, places more than most,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've been in the legal ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, a lot of those legal stuff
looks better than the black market when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the facility, like I said,
they've just got great facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have, I just had literally a place
that I was at this week that I have seen,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would consider the top grower in Canada
for the legal place, like just absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: gorgeous product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it come down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it on the dry table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, this looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is unbelievably, high quality weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go to the legal store and buy
the exact batch that I bought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the difference is mostly age
where it's just by the time, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they cure it and send it out for quality
tests and THC tests and get the results
[SPEAKER_01]: back and then get it up into the,
you know, the pipeline, the distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then somebody, you know, the middleman
buys it and then the end store buys it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it sits in inventory in the
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the end user buys it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long that cycle is,
but it's definitely way longer than the
[SPEAKER_01]: black market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I see it, I'm like, this,
this looks like old weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like no different than good weed
that I grew and stuck in a jar for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a year or a good weed that my
friend was a black market grower did the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looks like old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for sure, I think that's the number one
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe there's stuff like, you know,
flushing it with, you know, nitrogen gas
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just oxidized weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of other stuff in
there, but that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, the top one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other one, I'm just like,
for God's sake, somebody grows something
[SPEAKER_01]: other than like wedding cake crashers or
nothing, not to diss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are great strains,
but it's just like, everything's the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's not a whole lot of unique
stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you could definitely,
they could widen the palette, but I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: they just do what the market sells,
but growing wise, a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get, I get, I think they get unfairly
smashed these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of curiosity, what are some of the
really popular strains in the facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't even bother keeping
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I just call them like glitter
cookies, just all different versions of
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies, which I, you know, I like cookies
and I'm dissing it, but to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost a hundred percent of it just like,
like different versions of cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, by cookies, I mean also all
the, I don't keep track of all the gelatos
[SPEAKER_01]: and wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just consider all that coming out of
that, you know, cookie family type stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but all that, you know, purple dense
glitter weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely just seems to center on
there, but I honestly, I'm not the best
[SPEAKER_01]: person to ask about the legal market
because I've literally bought from the
[SPEAKER_01]: legal market about like two times in my
entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just seen, I've seen a lot of it
grown and I've seen the occasional thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that one of my friends will buy,
but my whole, most of my like crowd is
[SPEAKER_01]: highly insulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I see it all the time,
all my, all the stuff I generally smoke or
[SPEAKER_01]: my friend's hook is all black market or
just home grower stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping the, the home ground strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I would love to ask you, cause I've
been following this myself, so I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: others are keen as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done some killer looking GMO sweet
skunk hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you created them yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be able to give us a bit of info
on how those turned out?
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a great cross of like your
new school meets old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was kind of my plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just, I said, um, I really liked
some of those old lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just for any of your listeners,
like sweet skunk is debatable,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's a NL five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for sure, sweet skunk comes back to
about 1994.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just kind of like back in the,
um, Neville days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know for sure it had Northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern lights, haze sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, maybe it has great freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It maybe doesn't depend who you ask the
official story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came from breeder Steve's camp,
but it's regardless of what's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern lights, haze sea, um,
haze dominant hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been around, I personally
consider like one of the most elite clones
[SPEAKER_01]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you look at like the crews that
it came from, it came from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder Steve's crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, you look at the people that
still hold that cutting around and they
[SPEAKER_01]: had access to Romulan, all these crazy
genetics and sweet tooth and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't see any sweet tooth clones
still going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see any Romulan clones still
going around for most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a whole lot of people that held
onto a sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I kind of just, to me, I just kind
of, to me, that's a classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Canadian heirloom and I like sativas,
but I don't, I'm like kind of like some
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom end to go with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really like the, I kind of like
some mercy and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like some, uh, flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like kind of some of the modern flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just threw, I just reversed,
uh, sweet skunk on to just all the clones
[SPEAKER_01]: that I had and happened to have a GMO in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't actually my plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of threw out the progeny of a
bunch of different stuff that I had in the
[SPEAKER_01]: GMO one is the one that really clicked
some of the, um, I was just basically
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for, uh, to pull a really nice
haze dominant, you know, personal cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, the, I think, which is kind
of in line with what you hear with a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of haze stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet skunk puts out a lot of junk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's kind of the story of
haze is I don't know that anyone's ever
[SPEAKER_01]: going to release like a really great haze
seed line that you pop like a haze
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant seed line, pop like a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, this is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the keeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like you pop like a hundred and
find one that's really nice and a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty mediocre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of the story of a sweet
skunk, but it definitely, there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: nice stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also a bunch of, uh,
really midsy stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I got the ones I kept three out
of, I think about 150 that I popped that
[SPEAKER_01]: are all, uh, um, super nice, but a lot of
them went right in the, in the hash pile
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no room for the week in the stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of curiosity, what sort of project
would you want to work on next given,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you've, you've done a lot of the
sort of haze type stuff with this sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want something different or you
like more keen to get down the rabbit
[SPEAKER_00]: hole?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I kind of, I'm kind of, I've been
around, like I said, I've been around a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of between the, I've traveled a
lot, so I've kind of got to experience a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of what's going around in the U S a
lot of what's going around in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've gone to the Netherlands quite a
few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've tried everything and I kind of
know, what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've kind of taken and said,
I'm not a commercial breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no interest in doing, I kind of
just breed for my own head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it kind of just comes into a few
camps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I like purple fish stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, um, stuff like the, you know,
haze stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I like some of like the Bubba
stuff and I've kind of got a pretty good
[SPEAKER_01]: stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, kind of think the only thing I
actually plan on doing is that that haze
[SPEAKER_01]: project isn't really done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both, most of the stuff I probably
don't have a lot of plans for that sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: spoon project was kind of the first stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things I always really liked
that stood out in history to me is
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I bought a quite a few packs back in
like the, I think it was around 2000 or so
[SPEAKER_01]: back when Neville and Shanti released
their original Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's the same now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally doubt it, but for sure the
original Neville's haze, which was the
[SPEAKER_01]: haze a male, um, I can't remember the
exact mix, but it was a, the two male
[SPEAKER_01]: hazes, haze A, haze C and Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was like jungle weed,
but they had some crazy phenos that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would consider in that class, the best
that I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never seen anything similar to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that was, and the thing with haze
is if you want to find a really good one
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want, it's pretty expensive to be
buying all those packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I really think you need to buy like
a hundred to find something really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so I kind of went at it from
another point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of like, okay, that's the haze C side was
the sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found something that I really liked
kind of modernized with a bit with the
[SPEAKER_01]: GMO, like just above the Terp and the
potency up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I want to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I really wanted out of this kind of
one of those incensey Neville's haze type
[SPEAKER_01]: of types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I, right now I just reversed,
uh, that Band-Aid haze number seven on the
[SPEAKER_01]: really late flowering, like 17 week
flowering, uh, haze phenos of that sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll probably try to find some other
stuff that's got that haze A side in it to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring it in and then just sift through
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't really, I guess they're
technically breeding projects to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just sifting projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a, I kind of look at cannabis
genetics a little bit different than a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of look at, I used to be down the
same line with everyone, with all the IBLs
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like when they breed like trees
or strawberries or these other,
[SPEAKER_01]: like really out-crossing species where
it's just like, you kind of whack an elite
[SPEAKER_01]: clone and an elite clone and grow a whole
crap load of seeds and take the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes the combination more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't really consider much of a
breeding project is just like a genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: sifting project, but that's about the only
thing I'd probably plan on, on,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, working like to make some more
productive use of my space, just growing
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the clones that have sifted over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm incredibly jealous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that some of those are Neville's
haze onto the, uh, the 16, 17 week sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk phenos would be some beautiful stuff
for all of our sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be interested to hear you just,
you just referenced it yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, flaring out some of the
clones you've sort of acquired over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the one clone that you used to
have that you really wish you could get
[SPEAKER_00]: back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not many of them, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I guess the one that stands out,
I really liked, um, there was,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, when legends used to have,
uh, that legends ultimate Indica,
[SPEAKER_01]: which that was this Ortega clone that
actually came from, uh, Ed Rosenthal,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, crossed with the sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, I'm not a sweet tooth fan at
all, but, uh, that popped out these crazy,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Jurassic looking Indica phenos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to run like back in the early
2000s or whenever, whenever that was
[SPEAKER_01]: Friederstein was really pumping all that
stuff out from Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran quite a few packs of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of them, I didn't like they're
really sweet tooth dominant, but they
[SPEAKER_01]: popped out these crazy Ortega phenos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, those I really like, they don't
stand up like today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor definitely wasn't the same,
but they just had super insane,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, mercy in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just so heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't think, I think it was a fairly
flat profile compared to like an OG or
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies or something like that,
but they were just really heavy Indicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I really prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that one I missed, I used to have a
really good Ortega clone, um, or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: the Ortega phenoclone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably the biggest one is a couple
of Indicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I used to have an old Northern
lights, number one clone that was really
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also used to have a Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it was in Northern lights,
number two, but that's the one that really
[SPEAKER_01]: stands out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, we got it like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those stories, it was like from my
friend's uncle who had it since like the
[SPEAKER_01]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was, if you, it was one you
could actually trace back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, okay, like that literally
came from like 1988, 1987 kind of period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like this super, um,
it's actually, I got the very first
[SPEAKER_01]: picture I ever posted on Instagram is from
that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was like this super squat
Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looked a lot like the, a lot of the
Northern lights you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the turf profile was just off the
hook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and I've never tried anything
similar to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of stuff today that I think
is like comparable, but way different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I really like to get that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's me always stood the test of time
that, you know, people didn't keep clones
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot back then for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was just whatever someone would
grow for a year and there would be like
[SPEAKER_01]: police pressure on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they shut down and not keep their
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was hard to get stuff back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one, I remember like losing a
bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time I went to look for it,
you know, over like a 10 year period,
[SPEAKER_01]: I could always find a friend of a friend
of a friend who still had that old NL
[SPEAKER_01]: clone that came out and came out of
Squamish in BC, which is a real small
[SPEAKER_01]: place North of Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, I mean, I think that thing
was like, I don't remember, like we had it
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I lost it maybe 10 years ago and
it was from like 1986 or 87 or 88,
[SPEAKER_01]: something in that definitely late
eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I've never seen anything similar
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably like, and then some of the
insensi nevels he used to have,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the stuff like I would kind of,
that's kind of what I find interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: about genetics is the stuff just kind of
repeats like that old famous Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: lower that Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one clone that, that I really liked
from back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty darn similar to Bubba and
Bubba's got basically everything it had
[SPEAKER_01]: plus like some better flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think we lose a ton of the
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of think a lot of it just gets a
little bit improved and the name gets
[SPEAKER_01]: changed over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I get more experienced with the NLs,
I see a lot of Bubba in it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's cool to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you see that as well at this point,
I think it'd be good to, to run through
[SPEAKER_00]: some of our quick fire questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a little alternative list of
questions for you in case you had prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: some answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to keep you on your toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your opinion, what do you think is the
most underrated Canadian clone or genetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, the Canadian, it's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Canadian gene pool is actually pretty
shallow and it's mostly American genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, underrated one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I could go with an under,
under, no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked the death Bubba,
which is like a modern one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty commercialized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally think that's like,
that's one of the clones that I would,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I had to pick a couple, I'd pick death
Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the, um, I think sometimes
just because it's super popular doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: mean it's not also super good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be interested in hearing,
how does that differ from Bubba?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have heard and seen a lot of it,
but never really read too much specifics
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I have never, I've smoked a lot of
like Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: From seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't smoked any of the like pre 98 or
like the ones you're like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the legit cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't smoked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's to compare it with what I can tell
is just a, it's a really nice Bubba,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's got some fuel to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a little bit more fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like, uh, I think if I had
to guess it probably originally came from,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, pips weed from souvenir seeds or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the story was, it was, cause he's the
only guy ever seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a death star or one of those death
things that came out of Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it was like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a Choco, uh, sour diesel cut
cross with that sensing star.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a sensei star that was around that
Ohio area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, crossed into one of the Bubbas and
maybe it wasn't from, from hips,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I know he's made a lot of that stuff
around that time period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually came into, it was one of
the dispensaries and kind of that gray
[SPEAKER_01]: market scene before it got legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like a, for a while,
it was like, the top clone going around to
[SPEAKER_01]: BC and it was locked down hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not even sure what I have the most
common one that's going around,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's the actual original,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I really like it from my personal,
um, thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like those narcotic narcotic Indicas,
but I just consider a Bubba with some,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, with a bit more fuel to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Hey, I'm going to have to keep an
eye out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like it's a pretty nice,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's got a bit of sour D and sensei
star in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, that's it's actually an
American, it's actually American genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just goes around in Canada,
like most of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, I know people say that,
you know, pink cushions had its day in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had it that much, but I think
it's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you rate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's like, we're done with it
or what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, so I'm kind of the opposite to most
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: How I do is I don't pay attention to the
hype at all usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go like, I think, Oh, I think I told you
before, like, Oh geez, we're going around
[SPEAKER_01]: for like at least a decade before I even
bothered trying them because I'm just so
[SPEAKER_01]: just been around so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually the hype isn't that isn't actually
worth the hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've just wasted a ton of time chasing
that crap when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I kind of just don't even pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when something like death,
Bubba is a great example where that BC,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually the really good stuff floats to
the top and it stays around for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I see stuff staying around,
I'm like, Oh, maybe I'll try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pink Kush definitely just passed that
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally think it's super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't consider it as good to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I consider it very similar to like an OG
and I consider OG better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I think it's like the same type.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally think that OG is a higher
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Pink Kush probably yields better
and it's a nicer growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's probably going
anywhere, but I personally thought to
[SPEAKER_01]: choose between an OG and I think Kershaw
choose OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a reflection of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, how little I've tried Pink Kush is why
I still like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of our normal quick fire questions
we ask people, what is your most favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis experience you've ever had?
[SPEAKER_00]: So be it like, you know, just trying a
certain strain, a certain hit of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what really stands out to you as one
of the most memorable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, most memorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, some of these ones,
it's like, I don't know, was it really
[SPEAKER_01]: that great?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just because you were an
experienced smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I grew up, it was all hash,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, you got, it was all, I grew up
when it was just imports around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got, you couldn't even smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't even sell homegrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you wanted to sell whatever skunk,
number one, you had to like press it into
[SPEAKER_01]: a brick and make it go all prowner and
sell it as Mexican or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of grew up around the import and
the part of cannabis family was all hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of it was Afghan hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or, you know, that border ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty, some like the, you know,
Afghan Pakistan area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every once in a while we get something
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this actually, when I look back,
it seemed like really low quality hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like a blonde Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in hindsight, that was
probably not that I would consider
[SPEAKER_01]: Lebanese like a super it's a sativa,
but it's not like a whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a haze or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I totally remember being at like
a, whatever, like a bush party,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, um, on the side of this cliff
and smoking this Lebanese hash for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the few experiences that
I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is way back when I was like 18 or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the few cannabis
experience that I would like compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: like taking acid or mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was very, um, psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, maybe it was just the fried
growing up smoking these like super heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghan hashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that was just one of my first
real sativa experiences, but that one
[SPEAKER_01]: really stands up in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a crazy flavor and this really
intense cerebral high where I was,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember sitting off by myself on
the side of this cliff going into like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep, deep introspective thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that probably is the one that stands
out the most still.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a beautiful experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very jealous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I've ever had proper Lebanese
hash maybe years ago in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like, who even knows what that was
really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it is not very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we're going to drop you off on an
island.
[SPEAKER_00]: What three genetics are you going to take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be clones or seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do some seed sifting yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we going to leave you with?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'd probably take clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've popped a lot of seeds in my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm getting older.
[SPEAKER_01]: My retirement is when I grow clones really
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would definitely, I said,
I'm not a big sativa guy, but I really,
[SPEAKER_01]: the one I actually, I like kind of this
heavy, heavy Neville's haze types,
[SPEAKER_01]: but other than for like what I would
consider like a classic sativa,
[SPEAKER_01]: the only one I really smoke regularly is
that, uh, Robert's Creek Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely take that even though I
don't really smoke it a ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like having it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: For, uh, if you ever want to smoke in the
daytime or anything, uh, probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: death Bubba and something purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a purple Kush or, uh,
I like those almost like almost that
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies type, but once I didn't even know
what the turf profile is, that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: funky purple cushy lavender, like a little
lavender turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that try a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that lavendery stuff, but those are
probably the three, some, one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: purple lavender types, the Congo and,
uh, some death Bubba for nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our final question, I'd love to ask
you, if you can go back in time,
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere, any place to get one genetic or
cut or whatever it may be, where are you
[SPEAKER_00]: going?
[SPEAKER_00]: When and what are you grabbing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm not a much, I know everyone
talks about like their landry and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go back to Afghanistan and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do actually travel a lot,
but I don't really have a lot of interest
[SPEAKER_01]: in traveling to other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like traveling around North
America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would probably, and I also like
people doing other, like a lot of sifting
[SPEAKER_01]: for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably go on dead tour
somewhere, um, both to catch some good
[SPEAKER_01]: dead shows and to catch some, some,
that was a dead tour back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was really, to me, I look at it
as like a funnel point where all the best
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics or all the best weed going around
in the U S ended up on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would probably take like,
dead tour, maybe back in like the eighties
[SPEAKER_01]: sometime, maybe just before the seed bank
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like definitely something in the
eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think you can catch the combo
of like, what was going around there
[SPEAKER_01]: before, you know, Neville just blew up the
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I think that's really one
of the nuclear events that happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is Neville, like just not
necessarily that he was like the be all
[SPEAKER_01]: and end all, he just spread so much of
very similar genetics everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like to maybe go in there,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like mid eighties or early eighties before
that was around, but I think there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of domestic cultivation on dead tour
and, uh, catch some bread, Brent,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Midland shows while I was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he was an awesome guitar or awesome
at keyboardists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a good one to pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before, I definitely want to give you
an opportunity to give some comments and
[SPEAKER_00]: shout outs, but make sure you also let
people know where they can find you on
[SPEAKER_00]: social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: On social media, I just, I'm just on IG,
which is direwolf.og.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really do much stuff outside of
that these days, uh, in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and shout outs, just all my,
uh, all my black market people,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, they're still rocking on trying to
survive or moving on into the new market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the luck to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, thank you so much for coming on
the show, giving us a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done down on Canadian history,
on the legal markets, the futures,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a bit of your own plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, again, direwolf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thanks for, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always good, uh, having conversations
with you.
Thanks for having me.
