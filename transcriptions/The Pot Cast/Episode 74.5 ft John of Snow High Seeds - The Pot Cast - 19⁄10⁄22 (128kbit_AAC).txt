[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all right, all right,
my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're back for part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of this special installment with Snow
High, the incredible genetic genius behind
[SPEAKER_00]: Snow High Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoyed part one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't heard it, go back and jump
into it before you hear this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll make more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just referenced the OG and the
Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard rumors of a few different
Skywalkers going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard one that it's like just a
straight OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've heard that there's another one
that goes around that's actually like the
[SPEAKER_00]: original one, Crosstabubba, or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also called Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know, the one you're fond of,
is that like the very straightforward OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does it seem a little different to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when I was growing these and
breeding these, this was like the height
[SPEAKER_02]: of the OG Kush crazes, you know,
as far as the medical clubs having them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like the height of the medical
club scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, you know, I got them before they
were like super-populized.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Skywalker also, a lot of people
thought there was one done by like
[SPEAKER_02]: Barney's Farm or something, which is like
blueberry and something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mazar with blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not Skywalker OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skywalker, it was this meant as,
you know, a high-flying OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's why it was called
Skywalker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not because it was part of like some Dutch
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skywalker and some of the OGs,
they're different than each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like the Triangle Kush out of
Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's OG Kush out of Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is the Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all look different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is happened is these are all
familiar, these are all strains that are
[SPEAKER_02]: very familiar to each other because the
genetics are very similar, but they are
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look differently and they smoke
differently, but they have similar
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of what people call OG Kushes are
different minds that are similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they are Afghani-Pakistani in
lines with maybe some tie-in involved in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to say exactly, but the
Skywalker grows and looks differently than
[SPEAKER_02]: the Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tahoe looks similar to like Pierre Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: The San Fernando Valley looks similar to
Bubba, but they're different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Master Kush looks similar to San Fernando
Valley and G13.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, there's different varieties
that are very similar to each other,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're definitely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem is a lot of stuff that was
popularized was from bag seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people got bag seed and they
grew those out as a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that was what most people got
their hands on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even with, you know, bag seed,
the plants will look different,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, than the mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have different variations,
or it came from impromptu fertilization of
[SPEAKER_02]: different lines that were growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it hermed on another,
you know, clone that they had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he has some like
multi-polyhydride hybrid of a,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a Kush variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the problem is there was no real
breeding done with a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's hard to say what it
was, what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's why I breed with certain
landrace and heirloom lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I create lines that I know the,
you know, the pedigree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise a lot of people are arguing
like, oh no, that's my clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all hearsay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, and I don't want to fight
with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no point to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to create something,
create it from original, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there's, it's just,
at this point, there's been so much mix
[SPEAKER_02]: that they call, you know, OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: But OG Kush is actually several different
varieties that have the same effects and
[SPEAKER_02]: same looks and tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm wondering, you know,
can we expect to see you then work with
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the other more sort of modern
strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've done a cross with cookies
before, but I haven't seen any runs or
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think you'll incorporate more of
the popular stuff or just stick to the
[SPEAKER_00]: more old school?
[SPEAKER_02]: I could do the other lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've always had, like, go to
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew the first cutting available at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call it panty dropper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't release the seeds much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people got some packs, but there's
the panty dropper and the panty dropper
[SPEAKER_02]: special edition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's grilled scout cookies with
the two males that created the true
[SPEAKER_02]: gangster Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the panty dropper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the special edition is the panty
dropper with the Hell's Angel line,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is the OG Kush with the true
gangster Kush line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those need to be revisited and kind of
worked out because the instability of the
[SPEAKER_02]: grilled scout cookies was, it was,
you know, driven poison and OG Kush with
[SPEAKER_02]: the cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was some bag seed issues,
you know, it was created from her method,
[SPEAKER_02]: did a reproduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unstable to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not kind of great for,
you know, creating lines from.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to stabilize the line and then
release it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm going to use a cutting,
I'm going to grow it out and then see if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's worth, you know, the trouble like the
pink panther was kind of a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unstable line, but trying to breed with it
to stabilize it some for the qualities
[SPEAKER_02]: that it had was worth the time because it
produced some medicinal get smokable
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the flowers turned purple and
red and had a beautiful grape liqueur
[SPEAKER_02]: smell and taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like a great OG Kush,
but it grew better and yielded the better,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it also has some CBD to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it had some medicinal qualities that
were similar to the anti-seizure CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: strain called Charlotte's web.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had the same ratio of like three to one
CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was medicinal at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there may be some in the future,
some of the modern stuff, but why
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody else is doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need another person doing it
unless there's going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, an increase to the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to improve it in some way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like with the East coast, sour diesel,
there was so many sour diesels on the West
[SPEAKER_02]: coast that there were shit to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't worth growing because they
didn't have the full flavor of the sour
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they didn't have the sourness,
the smell, the taste, the aroma,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they were sour diesel ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was what was going around as
clones for sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It yielded well, but you know,
it didn't, it wasn't sour diesel like it
[SPEAKER_02]: should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: The East coast sour diesel clone was
tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't yield well or root well,
but it had the smell and flavors of the
[SPEAKER_02]: great perfect high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically I wanted to work with
something fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I self did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I created a couple females from
that, picked the best one, the first
[SPEAKER_02]: generation with the Neville's Hayes purple
thyme male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, they're 50, 50, sometimes
they're, they're, there's some good
[SPEAKER_02]: females and some of them are kind of,
you know, not so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had to pick the best, um,
plants from that first generation into the
[SPEAKER_02]: F twos and F twos is what I released as
the West coast purple diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you get those, you know,
qualities, the East coast, our diesel with
[SPEAKER_02]: those good traits, the smell, the
sourness, uh, that fantastic, high resin
[SPEAKER_02]: production and aroma, but with good
rooting, big plants, big buds,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd want from what was supposed to be
sour diesel, but without the problems,
[SPEAKER_02]: not to say that recessives won't pop up,
but you're going to have a more stable
[SPEAKER_02]: line, which will give you all the
characteristics that you love from sour
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be the only reason to kind
of revisit some of these lines that are
[SPEAKER_02]: popular with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in general open to like S wanting
old clones and just sort of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: revitalize them like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us more.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I, I don't, I don't like,
uh, selfing anything because if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to sell something, it should be true
breeding because if it's not, you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be inviting problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're selfing or, you know,
feminizing plants that aren't stable,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you grow them out, you can have all
kinds of issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to be exact replicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, if you're going to do that
might as well, just make regular seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, because you're going to invite
instability and, um, inter intersex traits
[SPEAKER_02]: into a plant, uh, which is unstable to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to be having people
that aren't expert growers, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: that are stressing out the plants,
uh, creating more plants from the intersex
[SPEAKER_02]: traits that are going to invariably pop up
from these unstable plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's just a mess that I don't
care to get into unless I'm trying to save
[SPEAKER_02]: a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, if there's only like one
plant, then there's ways of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: selfing them, going to those lines,
finding the males and females from the
[SPEAKER_02]: selfing process, and then slowly breeding
towards something that is stable from
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, uh, selfing of that line
that's, you know, lost or, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: extinct, you know, if there's only one
plant left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've come into that problem where I
had only, um, you know, a few plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: then those plants that were with it,
that were the same line died, only one
[SPEAKER_02]: plant left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had to breed similar plants
like the Acapulco goldmine I bred,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was two different Acapulco
goldmines, but I could have selfed them
[SPEAKER_02]: and then, you know, hoped for males to
breed with the females to eventually make
[SPEAKER_02]: a more stable line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that, in those cases, I am,
uh, I think selfing it has its place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for tired lines, uh, like there
was a strain called Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was grown for like 30 years in Kansas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, when you're breed with that
line and make seed, um, the seeds don't
[SPEAKER_02]: last as long because they're from a tired
old clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the viability of those seeds is
even shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, creating an S one of
that, and then breeding would might be the
[SPEAKER_02]: way to do it, but you know, growing from
that old clone, uh, these clones are just
[SPEAKER_02]: replicas, you know, copies of copies of
copies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take a copier and take a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets blurrier and blurrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing happens with these clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not the same as it once was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they need to be refreshed once in
a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to grow from a new seed and be
refreshed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise they're just very tired old
seeds, uh, or old seed lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, there's issues to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had guests in the past say that
one way just speculated that, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be able to sort of revitalize
these plants is to let them veg under the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're indoor plants at all,
I guess, given your library with so many
[SPEAKER_00]: old school clones, what do you do to
maintain those old mothers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there any special tips like the
sunlight one you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, it depends on where you live.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're, um, you know, far enough
south, you can actually grow plants all
[SPEAKER_02]: year round outdoors, um, depending on your
environment or with the help of a
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse to extend your growing season,
you just need to use a little nitrogen to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of put them back into veg chemically,
and then, um, leaving enough growth on
[SPEAKER_02]: them to, you know, maintain growth until
the, um, the sun is into a place where it
[SPEAKER_02]: starts vegging again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you, I've had plants growing
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one of them is chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ran for three years outdoors,
uh, but I've had, uh, what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I had another one that went for seven
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's kept growing it outdoors,
um, you know, to see how long I can grow
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that happens like in Nepal,
you get these plants have been growing for
[SPEAKER_02]: decades and they get to be, you know,
three, four stories above the house,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in Nepal and huge plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't just happen over like one
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens over, you know, years and years
of it growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but as far as maintaining the plants,
uh, it's hard to keep a library of all
[SPEAKER_02]: these different plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I think that you should make a
line that is, um, strong with males and
[SPEAKER_02]: females.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can preserve the line of seeds and
then that way you don't have to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: clones of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can keep the special plants,
but it's really difficult to keep a
[SPEAKER_02]: library of, you know, all these different
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too much stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have health conditions like
myself, it's almost impossible to do
[SPEAKER_02]: because you might have days or weeks where
you're not able to, um, tend to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, things happen, you know,
as far as dust plants and you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody to tend to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, the other thing is, is micro,
micro property.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more people should try to get into
that where they can maintain things with a
[SPEAKER_02]: little plant, let a little stem and
maintain plants that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that'd be a good way
moving forward for people to have large
[SPEAKER_02]: collections and a smaller place,
um, you know, to be able to maintain those
[SPEAKER_02]: things, you know, um, seed, full seeds
will be able to be, um, germinated a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: easier with those types of methods as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, try to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get lost seeds, seed lines that
aren't able to germ any other way is to
[SPEAKER_02]: propagate them that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like some cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people have been chasing
the, what is it, the artificial embryo
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of for well and truly sort of dead
seeds, but in your personal library,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the oldest seeds you have and
what are some that you're sort of keen to
[SPEAKER_00]: look into that get you excited?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seeds that are back from the
sixties, sixties, seventies, eighties,
[SPEAKER_02]: nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a bunch from different periods of
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have old, I have old Panama reds,
you know, those, and I've got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: other old Mexicans that are just,
you know, who knows how old they are,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they need special, um, you know,
propagation methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, there's a lot more and I just
not telling you everything, but there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of cool stuff that would be great to
revive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, I'm working on methods
to try to, um, revive those old lines so
[SPEAKER_02]: that we could all enjoy them again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but basically they're extinct to this
point until, um, the method is made better
[SPEAKER_02]: to attempt to bring those back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the processor, it's, it's a work in
progress at the moment, but I've been able
[SPEAKER_02]: to work on old seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been able to germinate 30,
30 plus old seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's, you know, that's not an
easy thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 year old, 20 year old seeds is not a
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of, you know, typical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people are finding it's
definitely becoming more challenging to
[SPEAKER_00]: pop seeds that are getting older.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any tips for people who are
trying to pop some old seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another method to the seeds that
were created from organic methods,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning they were like sun grown seemed to
last a lot longer than seeds that were
[SPEAKER_02]: chemically made, like with chemicals
indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people find viability of like
seeds that were created indoors,
[SPEAKER_02]: usually like chemicals, but only lasted a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, with sun grown seeds, you can grow
them six to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: No issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they've been stored well,
we can even grow them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: keep them for longer periods of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for germinating, for old seeds,
um, it's sterile methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, same thing is like the scarification.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can use, there's lots of different
methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them might work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them might not, but the only thing
that kind of pushes things past dormancy
[SPEAKER_02]: is, um, jubilic acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem with jubilic acids is,
uh, that if you use too little,
[SPEAKER_02]: it does nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you use too much, you end up killing
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and if you find the right amount,
you're still dealing with like elongation,
[SPEAKER_02]: like long, you know, um, sprouts,
um, in issues that way, which,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if you got an old seed,
that's no big issue, but, uh, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: find the right ratio to germinate seeds
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if you only got a couple of seeds,
you could end up killing the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's almost not worth it, but I'd say,
um, softening the seeds with like a
[SPEAKER_02]: disinfectant, like hydrogen peroxide 50
50, um, and then pulling off the seed coat
[SPEAKER_02]: after two to three days, uh, taking the
embryo and then doing a vitro would
[SPEAKER_02]: probably be the best method after you've,
um, you know, disinfected it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then you need, uh, certain augers
and hormones to be able to, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, uh, germinate those seeds in a
auger solution, like wood tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very high tech answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, this is a bit of a curve
ball one, but I thought you'd have a
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a good take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's like the most wildly unexpected
results you got from popping like a land
[SPEAKER_00]: race or like an heirloom sort of line just
really left a field.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found I've popped seeds that had like
double embryos, like it was, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: two plants in one seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, like getting two different,
uh, germination sprouts out of one embryo
[SPEAKER_02]: seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, um, usually one is weaker
than the other, you know, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, it'd be interesting to see how those
would turn out, you know, from beginning
[SPEAKER_02]: to end, if, you know, one was more potent,
if one has certain traits or if one was
[SPEAKER_02]: more female and the other was male,
I've had like a, a Lao strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: which, um, it topped itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on one side of the plant,
um, which is what we had one, one root,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it basically went up and snapped in
half.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one side was all female with
female flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other side was male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like a monatious plant on one
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, you know, one sex on the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't intersex, but it was male and
female on the same plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: self pollinating itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I found that to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's really neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: First germination processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I don't know, there's
nothing real special about germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, um, I like to pull them
off and, you know, I use like a pinching
[SPEAKER_02]: motion to kind of pinch off the,
the films, um, off the, uh, the embryos.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you pull off the seed shell,
there's a, there's a film which you can
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of pinch off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then, you know, it basically comes
out, you know, you had the little sprout,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a little embryo sprout.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say, don't be scared of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot of more people should be popping
their seeds and removing the seed shells
[SPEAKER_02]: because you can get a higher percentage to
germinate once you've, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: removed the shell.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is it's kind of a,
you know, it, sometimes you end up
[SPEAKER_02]: squishing them or destroying them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if you don't, if you wait too
long, more than like three days,
[SPEAKER_02]: the embryo will become too soft anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will just, you know, mold or squish
very easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to do it within the two to
three day period.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a small window, which you can
actually move them in, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the whole together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but sowing those, uh, in a sterilized,
uh, soil will improve germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you, you'll get maybe, you know,
a few more plants and sometimes you get
[SPEAKER_02]: all your plants germinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if you didn't, you'd only get a few
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I'd say people should practice on
seeds, um, that aren't as valuable to them
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, practice removing the seed
shell and then removing the film and then
[SPEAKER_02]: sowing those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that people should do,
um, for all their seeds after a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise you're going to rot in the soil
or dry up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I digging up the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, if you sow the seeds directly in
the soil, um, you should also dig them up
[SPEAKER_02]: after two to three days and, uh,
do the same, clean them off, remove the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed shell, remove the film, and then sow
them back in the same spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were, uh, or in fresh soils,
because sometimes if they're, the soil is
[SPEAKER_02]: too moist, uh, that you'll need to,
um, um, you know, provide another
[SPEAKER_02]: sterilized soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is providing a little fans
over, uh, the, uh, germinating places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have, uh, seeds in a starter
tray or in beer cups, you should have a
[SPEAKER_02]: little fan providing circulation over
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of dries them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise the heat from the lights or the
sun and the moisture in the soil will
[SPEAKER_02]: cause molding, which will cause a damp
off, which will kill the plants or the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having a little, a good aerosol
circulation is very important,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, for germinating seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot of people don't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then their seeds die and then they,
you know, blame the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I agree that people need to learn to
become their own little seed surgeons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like yourself have saved the number of
seeds that probably wouldn't have made it
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, while we're on the topic of
saving plants, I wanted to know what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: oldest plant you've managed to save and
how do you hang onto?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have like a super like 30 year old
cutting?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've had old cuttings given to me by
other people, but, um, I typically like to
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve a line and seed form,
um, because it's easier to store and
[SPEAKER_02]: travel with, um, because it's just too
much energy to maintain clones for years
[SPEAKER_02]: and years and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there should be a reason, you know,
unless it's something special that you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to keep around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, majority of stuff, uh, I like to
preserve and seed form just because,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, if something happens,
you've got to back up that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, otherwise you got to spread those
clones out to friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't give you out your clones to
friends, then you lose that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, just like I lost the chocolate tie,
um, during my, my aunt's, um, passing of
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if I had been able to pass it out to
people, I would have been able to possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: get that back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sharing is actually a good way of
keeping the genetics and even be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: get it back at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned that myself in the past,
unless you share it out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you risk losing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some sage advice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're on the topic, one of the
fan submitted questions we got said,
[SPEAKER_00]: please ask Snow High to talk about
Darwal's chocolate tie and the golden
[SPEAKER_00]: dragon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden dragon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know anything about any golden
dragon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, oh, uh, gold dragon, my strain,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, the, the dro, dro is, is my
friend's, um, name backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's his name backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Howard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Howard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, Howard is, he went to my,
uh, my wedding.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Howard, uh, these came from chocolate
tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: These came from chocolate tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so what people don't realize is
chocolate tie was named by the sellers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here it looks like, you know,
what people have is chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got the, uh, I still have some of
that, uh, chocolate tie stick left too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to pull that up and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's got a musky aroma and tastes
like tobacco and chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's got a euphoric effect,
a body effect, but it's also has the tie
[SPEAKER_02]: soaring effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, um, kind of like, uh,
Punto Ro, Colombian Punto Rojo,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's like the tie equivalent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's got the, the body effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, uh, theory theorized that the
chocolate tie has, was a lowland variety,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, because it's got like, um,
indica characteristics, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's got a chunky larger flowering,
uh, bigger buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's got the characteristics of,
you know, muskiness, uh, like a purple
[SPEAKER_02]: tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also purple tie Finos in it,
but it's not as common.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, uh, that chocolate tie was from
chocolate tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it should be grown out in,
um, larger selections done on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's been a conservation of a
chocolate tie stick line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it is a great and super potent
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it may not look like much growing and
that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have is like, they expect
this narrow leaf highland tie looking
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, and it doesn't grow like that,
especially when it's in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause with a lot of, uh, sativa and
tropicals and equatorial plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the leaves are solar panels.
[SPEAKER_02]: They in veg, they are trying to produce
stem and growing the plant structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it flowers and starts to flower,
the solar panels, the leaves will go from
[SPEAKER_02]: like seven to five to three to two to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, three to one, typically not two to
one, but, um, basically the, the C the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the lease will narrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll get narrow and there'll be less
leaves and production will go to producing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Resins, um, turpins, that type of thing,
and less growth of the, uh, flowers and
[SPEAKER_02]: stem is done in that period of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so people don't realize that when they
see these plants in veg, they'll have
[SPEAKER_02]: broader leaves because the plant is
creating, you know, it's roots and
[SPEAKER_02]: structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not, it's not yet producing
the flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as it flowers, then they thin out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some of them are naturally thinner
than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some varieties like the highland varieties
will have thinner leaves, but there's so
[SPEAKER_02]: many different varieties of leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, some of them are super long,
like, um, like a eucalyptus or a weeping
[SPEAKER_02]: willow, um, you know, or long banana
leaves will be thick and long,
[SPEAKER_02]: or they'll be really thin and long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but people have this thing in their
mind that these type varieties are very
[SPEAKER_02]: narrow leaf thin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and not, there is some like that,
but they're not all like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they come in different sizes and
shapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the, the, that is a chocolate tie
line derived from seeds from imported
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolate tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the drill chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a euphoric high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's colorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a day brightener.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, your shittiest day will be happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you'll, you'll feel a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's colorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be really intense at first,
but they kind of, it lightens up a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit, but it is a wonderful high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very resonance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a sickly sweet smell and taste to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's divine, but it doesn't look like
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when you're growing it, it looks like
it's not impressive, not at first,
[SPEAKER_02]: but as it further goes into flower,
uh, it becomes more impressive as it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're first growing it,
um, even a veg and midway through flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just not, it's just not an impressive
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of lines, you know,
a lot of lines you go like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's going to be great,
but, um, not all plants are like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can't judge a book by its
cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that is a very impressive line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, a lot of people,
you know, uh, think, Oh, it, it's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: pure line, but, um, in Thailand,
there's hybridization done.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's low land varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's highland varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, there is a bottlenecking of
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many things that go on with
plants that some of this has been done in
[SPEAKER_02]: the past and people look at it and go,
Oh, there's some modern characteristics to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, especially if grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you see a plant grown indoors,
it may look, you know, kind of like a
[SPEAKER_02]: modern plant, but if you took that same
plant and put it outdoors, the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, the sun, the wind,
everything will make it look more like it
[SPEAKER_02]: should.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see these, you know, very tall,
upright high looking plants that are kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, bamboo like, um,
or, uh, you know, uh, Japanese maple
[SPEAKER_02]: looking, you know, the different
structures outdoors really brings out what
[SPEAKER_02]: a plant should look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoors it's a controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're only getting one aspect of what
that plant really could be, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people are flowering out these
plants with different light sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using LEDs, plants end up being
more chunky, shorter, and, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: they, they branch out differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you're using fluorescence,
they kind of, um, you know, will branch
[SPEAKER_02]: out, look, you know, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they just won't be as dense using a
metal halide and they get very resonance
[SPEAKER_02]: and.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good plants and using HPS, they get very,
um, you know, squat and branchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you just, it just depends on the light
source you're using, uh, for the looks of
[SPEAKER_02]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not only that, um, indoor versus
outdoor, um, you know, it all matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and the length of time, a lot of
people are using too much light to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: their plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think, oh, more light, the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not necessarily true.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants are like humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's circadian rhythms.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the darkness and the light,
they need sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to have the restorative sleep
where they produce near these,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, precursors to create cannabinoids or,
you know, these things that protect
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves from, you know, pests or
whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they're, they're created when they
sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they need a dark period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't use like 24 hours of light
and think they're going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, resting the plants will
actually be improving on the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to have the right ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have too much light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you have to have something right in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why, um, I've developed ratios
of light and darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 10 and a half hours of light and 13 and
a half hours of darkness is kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: the sweet spot for most all varieties
around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want something to work for
everything, that ratio works for flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if you're doing it from
seed, if you're starting off that way,
[SPEAKER_02]: even better, um, veg seed, uh,
anyway, it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can give people breakdowns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've written a documentation for
anybody that's wanting this, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they want to, um, contact me by email.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to look more into it
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to ask those sort of based on
what you were saying there, what's your
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on autos given they don't get,
uh, much darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they'll ever be able to get
to a point where they're comparable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause people espouse that as the
aspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it is possible for auto
flowering cannabis to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: say as good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, auto flowering, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, they're, they're,
it's just a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're using something that flowers
early.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an early flowering hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, auto flowering is kind of a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to use a lot of stuff that's
hemp variety auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're basically using stuff that's,
uh, flowering early.
[SPEAKER_02]: So photosensitive varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you can take anything that's
photosensitive and make it grow well,
[SPEAKER_02]: as long as they're using good breeding
practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so what, one of the common questions
we got from a lot of different listeners
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact was they were wondering if they
could get some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a lot of people want to try to grow
some of these like really wild stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I, but they're indoors and they're
like, how do I do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know if it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any tips?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the problems is that a lot of
these like books and stuff that people buy
[SPEAKER_02]: is, oh, uh, you take a plant and you
basically veg it for a few days and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you flower it right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way they're shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is that's not good because you
don't have enough roots that can deal with
[SPEAKER_02]: stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to grow something,
you need to veg the plant long enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're growing a plant,
grow the roots, train the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by doing that, um, making, you know,
more main stems by topping it,
[SPEAKER_02]: forcing the oxygen to create more roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can kind of put some focus on the
roots first by doing that and then
[SPEAKER_02]: repotting them, you know, pull off the
bottom of the pot, look at the roots,
[SPEAKER_02]: use beer cups at first that are clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the root development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, examine the roots,
kind of make sure that the soil isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: overly moist and wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use a moisture meter, you know,
check the plant, you know, check this,
[SPEAKER_02]: the container several different places,
make sure that it's.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, dry enough to actually water
because a lot of people over water and
[SPEAKER_02]: then there's no root development.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, it stunts the plants and it pisses the
plants off where they herm on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, mold and then die.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the problem is, uh, root development,
grow those roots first and then flower
[SPEAKER_02]: them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you have the right ratio,
uh, you can save several weeks on these
[SPEAKER_02]: long flowering varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're doing what a lot of these
magazines and magazines and books will
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you to flower 12 off, you may never,
ever finish your plant or it will take
[SPEAKER_02]: forever to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that light regimen doesn't,
isn't, uh, in nature, it's not something
[SPEAKER_02]: that happens on earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's no 12 hours of light and
12 hours of darkness anywhere on the
[SPEAKER_02]: planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why would you do that in an indoor
grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so basically you have to have the
right ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you use, um, you know, the right
amount of darkness, you can flower plants
[SPEAKER_02]: faster and, and sex them faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're vegging plants and then
growing the roots, you can sex them and
[SPEAKER_02]: then revert it back to your veg period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can sex your plants, know which
males, females you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can either clone the ones that
you like, um, or grow those plants into
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants that you want to a certain
size, or you, you kill the plants that you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want and the pot more seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need more of a certain type or more
numbers or males, of a certain type.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a killer, killer overview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really keen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, I noticed,
um, your strain epic haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do anything different when you have
those ultra long flowering types?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or again, same thing, just expected to end
up a little bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Majority of the plants will finish in 14
to 16 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even some of the longer flowering
varieties will finish in 16 weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is not so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be longer flowering varieties
that will take longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can always take things earlier,
but patients, um, you know, why grow
[SPEAKER_02]: something for eight or nine weeks,
uh, that will finish better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 14 weeks, um, why take something
earlier?
[SPEAKER_02]: If, if the quality is not there,
um, you'll find that, uh, something like a
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian that grows, you know,
for 20 to 26 weeks in a greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, finishes in March or April
outdoors, meaning like it takes a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: year of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then flowering to finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will finish indoors faster because
you're able to manipulate the lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if you're using a greenhouse,
those last few months, the colors will
[SPEAKER_02]: come out, the, the reds, the oranges,
the purples, all those, that beauty in the
[SPEAKER_02]: line will actually present themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: The resins that take long weeks to grow
will, will be, um, more present.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get these, um, turpentine and
cannabinoid profiles that are just amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: psychedelic and very great expressions of
cannabis, you know, very delectable
[SPEAKER_02]: connoisseur herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if you harvest it too early,
you won't get those expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other issue is you need to know the
variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some varieties will finish faster than
others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you wait too long, then it's,
um, oxidized and you have more of an
[SPEAKER_02]: inferior product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some Mexicans will finish fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, once they have the peak THC
content, you know, the trichomes are fully
[SPEAKER_02]: developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should harvest the Mexicans because a
lot of times if you wait too long,
[SPEAKER_02]: then it starts to oxidize and then they
kind of get dried out and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: loses its quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you just need to know the variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, if you have the right variety,
then you, they need a harvest earlier at
[SPEAKER_02]: peak concentration, or you wait the time
it needs to finish to, to get the best
[SPEAKER_02]: qualities out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just, it just depends on what time
you're, you're willing to put into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then grow the variety that you're
willing to put in that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're not willing to put in
20, 24 weeks, don't get a pure Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, some Colombians will finish
faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but majority won't, you know,
these equatorial lines are at the equator.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not as photosensitive as something
that is, uh, grown in the Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but Mexico is kind of something that's
more northerly higher latitude and will
[SPEAKER_02]: finish faster, but it's also longer
flowering, but you know, may finish in
[SPEAKER_02]: October versus December, January,
February, March.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that certainly makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, picking according to what you're
willing to do as well as all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: little amazing tidbits of info there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I would love to quickly ask you
though, do you feel like you have to put
[SPEAKER_00]: any consideration into what we might
broadly call the commercial viability of
[SPEAKER_00]: your strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you said, you know,
people need to go into this sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what they're getting into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that ever hold you back?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you feel like you just make what you
want and, you know, let it go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't pick strains that are,
uh, fast flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not picking strains to finish fast
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be strains that will finish
faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm picking for quality and potency
above all else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those, those are my criteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a person's coming with, to me that
they want a seven or eight or nine week
[SPEAKER_02]: strain, I'm going to have some things I
could show them, but they're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: limited if their constraints are the
timeframe because the best qualities take
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're constrained to like needing
to harvest something in eight to nine
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, then you need to probably look
somewhere else because you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not choosing things to finish fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm choosing for quality potency and those
take a little time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically you not to say that you can't
find those faster phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are varieties that will finish
faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just the majority of the quality,
uh, phenotypes take longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just the nature of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone were to take a look at sort
of your overall back catalog of work,
[SPEAKER_00]: to me, it seems obvious that there's more
of a predominance of sativas than indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a reflection of just your personal
sort of preferences in regards to flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, things like that, or is it more a
case of like just the stock you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with and you know, other factors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the majority of them is sativas
because there's more sativas, tropicals,
[SPEAKER_02]: equatorials than there is indicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, that's the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just more of that than there are
these other kinds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and the reason why I'm working for
certain varieties is I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve varieties that may be lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm putting more emphasis on Mexicans,
Hawaiians, uh, Colombians that the seed
[SPEAKER_02]: stock is in short supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a long time to grow these lines
and they're almost lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to save these lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my, my focus may not be on exactly what
I want to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I'm trying to preserve it for the
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's where my focus is at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise I'd, I'd be growing a lot of
these faster flowering varieties and
[SPEAKER_02]: pumping them out and trying to make a lot
of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which would be nice, but I'm trying to
preserve these lines that take longer
[SPEAKER_02]: because if I don't, they're going to be
lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and unfortunately, because they take
longer, um, instead of popping out
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I could grow within a short
period of time and, you know, make a
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand couple thousand seeds,
hundreds of thousands of seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in a quick period of time,
I'm taking, you know, years to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: something that may not produce very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that's where people don't
understand is, is that you're unfamiliar
[SPEAKER_02]: with how long and how much work it takes
to create these lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that there's a lot of time involved,
not just the flowering, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the selection process, the growing,
the vegging, um, and, uh, you're just not
[SPEAKER_02]: making as much seed and takes a lot longer
to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, things take longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they cost more because the time
takes a lot more to produce them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all very lucky to have someone
like you ensuring the preservation of
[SPEAKER_00]: these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, I have to admit, I sort of
engineered that question well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wanted to get to this next one,
which was that one of, uh, one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: guests asked, they said, look,
you hear a lot about Afghan Indicas and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe, you know, a bit of Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, but you really don't hear too
much about Indicas in the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And occasionally, you know, Chinese little
blip on the map, the Yuan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what's your experience with Indicas
outside of the conventional Afghan
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistan?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts, unsung heroes,
anything we should keep our eye out for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Lebanese should be, uh, I'd ask some
of the best, um, Lebanon, uh, has one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the oldest cannabis cultures.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a, um, um, a temple there to,
um, the, the mysteries, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for like wine production and the ancient
past.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but wine in the past was used as a
vehicle for preserving, um, not only the
[SPEAKER_02]: alcohol, but other medicinal plants like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were able to take their canvas
plants and, um, preserve them in wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, in that area, they were able to
grow, um, cannabis and preserve them in
[SPEAKER_02]: the wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the winter, they were able to
have their cannabis along with their wines
[SPEAKER_02]: because they weren't drinking water.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were drinking wine, uh, because it
wasn't safe to drink water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, that, yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and in Lebanon, they have an ancient
cannabis history or, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that goes back once.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're selected for generations in the
Levant, which was like the Phoenician,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, stronghold of that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically that area is, um,
you know, they had the ziggurats,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Sumerians, there was ancient cannabis
culture, the area, which is, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: the bulk region of Afghanistan was a
Zoroastrian area, which isn't too far.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was pilgrimage pilgrimages from
other areas like Lebanon, Syria,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, which had hash plants, um,
Egypt also had hash plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indicas, um, you know, parts of,
uh, Kashmir, um, different parts of
[SPEAKER_02]: Pakistan, they all had these Indica
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Iran has ancient Persian history.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had something similar to Soma.
[SPEAKER_02]: India had the Soma, which was,
uh, cannabis, but the Persians,
[SPEAKER_02]: ancient Persians and Zoroastrians had,
um, the, uh, Haoma, which is basically,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had their Vedic, um, type books
as well, uh, indicating, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: this ancient, uh, cannabis, um,
you know, sacrament.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unsung Indicas around the world,
uh, there are Indicas in different places
[SPEAKER_02]: like Mexico, uh, has hash plants,
uh, Columbia has hash plants, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: different places around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it just depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: China has some, uh, the Yunnan province,
um, there's a, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: variability, not only due to, um,
its placement, but it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, altitude as the lowland variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some of them were able to,
um, look a certain way in some of them,
[SPEAKER_02]: as they went up higher in elevation,
they would look, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lowland varieties tended to be more
broadly because they're trying to capture
[SPEAKER_02]: more light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then the highland ones were
actually more elongated and stretchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, because they were getting a lot more
like they had to deal with like high
[SPEAKER_02]: winds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had to be able to be a bit more
bendable and different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it, it all depends, you know,
your environment plays a role on how the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants acclimatize change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, some of these Indicas may
be, um, uh, tolerant and resistant to,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, humidity that is from a cold,
uh, dry environment or a cold humid
[SPEAKER_02]: environment or hot humid environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people say, oh, this line is,
um, you know, resistant to humid
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, you know, is it a hot humid
or cold humid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you grow the wrong thing,
it'll mold real easy and you won't be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow certain varieties, you know,
on the coast, for instance, that grew in
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawaii, uh, in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it, it just depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these different things of climatization
matter and they affect the, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: qualities of these terpenes and the way
they evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I don't know how we're going to get
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to have to really
bluntly put it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's, uh, the old school big bud like,
was it ever good, like objectively,
[SPEAKER_00]: or was it just big yielding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it was big quality wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was old school Mexican, uh,
Afghani is what I figure it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the, the Mexicans were large,
the early, well, the stuff even up into
[SPEAKER_02]: the eighties were large plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, some of them would have the
colas de Zorro, which were, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: tails, uh, the, the Fox, so Fox tails.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody's colas get this,
the name from the Mexican word for colas
[SPEAKER_02]: de Zorro, uh, the Fox tails, but they're
only saying the tails portion,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Mexican word for it, Spanish word for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but they used to, you know,
a majority of the Mexicans produced,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, big bread loaf looking spear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have these big spear looking plants
that were like candelabra style or
[SPEAKER_02]: upright, or these big Christmas trees,
you know, like giant pines, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: that were 20, 30 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, uh, the big bud was a crossing of
some of these larger yielding Mexicans
[SPEAKER_02]: with, uh, some of the, um, early Afghani
stuff that was coming along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how come you think it died out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm sure some people are still growing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had it for a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost it, but as anything, um,
somebody's usually has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hiding out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look on the topic of someone
usually has it, there's a huge push within
[SPEAKER_00]: the community to find the roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think someone has it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some seeds that are old school
skunk, but, uh, they're old.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to germinate those,
bring them back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I had roadkill skunk back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last time I had it, uh, offered to me was
back in the nineties, 97.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it was on the border of
Canada and Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that stuff stunk so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super hashy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The joints has kept putting themselves out
and it's stunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, you ran over a couple of
skunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the juice is like that really
nasty fucking skunk and it got you really
[SPEAKER_02]: stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Credible weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the stuff that people know is like
skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one is it's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different, something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what I think the, the, the old skunks
were, were Mexican Afghani hybrids or,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, Mexican Durban or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but there was skunks before,
uh, that the, the labeled skunk number one
[SPEAKER_02]: was available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I'm working on, uh, I've got some
other skunk lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I did the fester skunk with,
but I'm trying to grow out more of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, uh, I've got some Afghanis that have
the skunk properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, if anything, I'm going to recreate
my own skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's in the works as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you got me wondering, what are some of
your favorite Afghanis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one of my favorite is the Petrolia
headstache.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there, there was, um, one that was,
it was an Afghani line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from the guy that created,
um, marijuana, he was a Steve Tuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the guy that actually did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That Steve Tuck made the seed line,
uh, reproduced it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the guy who made it was in Ukiah,
uh, California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but this guy was growing Mexican,
um, Mexican varieties in Colorado before
[SPEAKER_02]: he came to, um, uh, California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, at the time, uh, the Afghanis
came in, they basically killed all the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexicans that they were growing and
started growing these Afghanis,
[SPEAKER_02]: which were medium sized bush, um,
cataloger style, bushy Afghanis that
[SPEAKER_02]: turned red and purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and he showed me pictures of these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the, the Petrolia headstache that
I grew was like fruit punch, like Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, super tasty, um, euphoric body,
uh, body effects and stone and high at the
[SPEAKER_02]: same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like a clear, uh, Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, that's what people should
want to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a, you know, it's not a narcotic
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's basically, you know,
what people would say, like Oji Kush is
[SPEAKER_02]: like a sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like got that up high, but it's got
the stone and body effects at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a concert clear, um,
you know, effect, which is very pleasant,
[SPEAKER_02]: euphoric.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of like what most Afghani
should be is like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the Petrolia headstache,
there's one that was done by Reefer man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one isn't the same as the inbred
line that I had had of the Petrolia
[SPEAKER_02]: headstache.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're either two different lines
or that's something different,
[SPEAKER_02]: or it's a hybrid of something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the Petrolia headstache that I had
was like Hawaiian punch, um, or fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, this delectable wish I had that
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, anyway, that, that's, that's what you
want is, uh, one of those, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanis that has that, um, quality high
in that, you know, kind of sticks out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it isn't like a cloudy stony,
a narcotic drug type, um, effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I got to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have tried heroin, maybe not an original
clone or who knows, wasn't verified,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also some really nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heroin is, uh, there's a lot of variations
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's because so many people
got their hands on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to say what's what.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think that one's killer new Haven
and the Petrolia headstache.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know how much of the Petrolia
headstache is really in there or which
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, if I can talk to the breeder
again, maybe I'll see if he's got any
[SPEAKER_02]: original seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm supposed to bring him some special
Afghanis, um, that he's been looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, he's a, an old head that's
been in the know for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Oh, that's very exciting to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully something comes with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it will.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's easy to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, he's, he's in the
middle of, uh, Mendocino there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and he's, he's not a seed producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't, he doesn't breed, you know,
most people don't even know who he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just, he's just a guy that,
um, tailors to the community and they
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't even know that he is,
uh, you know, old school breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's the same that goes with a
lot of these guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: That don't seek recognition, but,
um, you know, they've been doing their
[SPEAKER_02]: work for years and helping out the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just people don't realize that they're,
you know, the doctors, their business
[SPEAKER_02]: people, their, you know, their gardeners,
they're different people and they're all
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I wish they would share their
stories and either they share them with me
[SPEAKER_02]: or, you know, get that, you know,
get that story out there because a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: this had stories to go along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've really got to document it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise it just gets lost to time,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people that, um, should deserve,
you know, um, you know, deserve credit,
[SPEAKER_02]: should get the credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, God, I, I, you know, I think this
first was like hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my sister had hash and I probably
smoked some of her hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably my first experience with
mushrooms and hash, but the, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the true first variety that I had was a
Colombian green that, um, my friend got it
[SPEAKER_02]: from his father and this Colombian green
was, um, grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and it was super resinous,
but it caused, uh, that Colombian choke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and if you had this old Colombian,
you know, because basically it takes the
[SPEAKER_02]: wind out of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke it and you're just coughing up
along this, um, makes immense clouds of
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you're barely touching, um,
you know, with the flame, the bud,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're, you're getting through the
resin profile, but it's a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a pure Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, man, it was, it was
incredible stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was just so potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: After a couple of hits, you're just,
uh, you're just kind of, uh, you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want anymore, but you're just so high that
it's, it's, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that was some Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like the first variety that I
had other than Mexican varieties,
[SPEAKER_02]: which were plentiful and many,
um, and all that was brown, but when I saw
[SPEAKER_02]: the green bud for the first time,
I didn't even know what that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I was like, wow, that's some green,
but that's some cool looking stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, the brown, but is what,
you know, I was majority familiar with
[SPEAKER_02]: brown or red or had different hair colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, green bud and brown bud was
the majority of what I grew up on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the killer green buds came in
with the Afghanis, um, that was something
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those, there was a lot of,
uh, variations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them were good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them were so hashy that,
uh, they were ass rid and off putting,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, because there was no selection and
they were getting all these land race
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, they were just trying
to find, you know, the good ones to grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we were getting like, you know,
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them were not always good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're doing selection,
some of them are got perfumey and sensey,
[SPEAKER_02]: ass rid, skunky, uh, those ass rid ones,
uh, were just super hashy, not tasty,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, very hard to consume.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you know, that's, that's what
happens when you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them are kind of off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what was the progression from sort
of that experience to thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I started growing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mexican seeds that I used to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I used to dig holes in the
backyard and the, the bag seat I would get
[SPEAKER_02]: for the Mexican varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause my cousins are Mexican and we used
to get different lots from their cousins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all their different cousins and family
were bringing different types of Mexican
[SPEAKER_02]: weed up from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, visiting family members.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd grow it out in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we're in Northern California,
you know, 14 miles away from Mendocino
[SPEAKER_02]: County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was a perfect climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I dig, um, holes in the hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I take, um, greenhouse roofing,
which was semi clear and laid across the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I dig big holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's doing these greenhouses that were
in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a helicopter, a camp helicopter
would come by and look down, all this
[SPEAKER_02]: thing is like, you know, trash or,
you know, a greenhouse, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that's just on the ground or in
piles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they wouldn't realize there's,
you know, being plants being grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, underground in like holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was, um, I'll grill a whole grill or
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was my first growing experience
of these varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them would be above ground,
but, uh, I did a lot of stuff indoors or
[SPEAKER_02]: in the ground for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did, uh, I grew on a roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, growing plants on a roof was kind of
sketchy, um, cause the planes,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, but I tried to put them near trees or
something like that to kind of avoid them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they were Mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were pretty tall and other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd grow next to pine trees and they
would get, uh, the size of pine trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, within a small amount of
time, you know, with the hot California
[SPEAKER_02]: sun, things would get really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get really tall of really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, one week you'd walk by
the plant and it's a couple of feet tall
[SPEAKER_02]: the next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fricking, you know, 15,
20 feet tall with, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: branches that as long as a human,
you know, 14 feet long distance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these things get just as wide as they
get tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they're, they're, they're massively
crazy big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I miss those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to find those old Mexicans like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting to hear how you
did it back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember when the first sort of,
uh, brand name strains started rolling out
[SPEAKER_00]: like strains with names or, uh,
was it sort of a progression?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I, in high times, I remember,
uh, you know, there was in ties and
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexicans, Durban's, there was those type
of branding the brand names were like
[SPEAKER_02]: Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think skunk was known.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I don't think Northern lights and that
stuff hadn't been around yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not till later.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there was, there was Hawaiian,
there was Maui Waui.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there was Panama red, aquafocal gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Colombian was colors, a lot of stuff
with colored weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was, you know, there was a
Mexican red, there was red hair.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, um, uh, you know, Colombian
green, there was Colombian brown,
[SPEAKER_02]: those Colombian gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there was Thai chocolate, Thai things
had names or places where it came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the majority of what stuff was
coming on when there was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, seed lines, the stuff in the
seed banks started coming around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I think Northern lights,
skunk, I think those ones were the first
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Northern lights with skunk haze,
skunk, you know, Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was all combinations of the
same stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the first, um, like cannabis cup
brought some of those seeds being sold
[SPEAKER_02]: over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I, I don't remember too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all, uh, tutti frutti names.
[SPEAKER_02]: People made up, you know, that was those,
but the seeds that seed blind seed banks
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember until later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In those early days, were there any
breeders who you sort of looked up to,
[SPEAKER_00]: or were you so insular that like,
you just hadn't even heard of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, back then it was so, uh, everybody was
so paranoid that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, you had to like have family members
and know people within the family to like
[SPEAKER_02]: get anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really paranoid, um, very
stringent, um, you know, anti cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: laws and you, you know, you didn't want to
be busted with anything at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, uh, so everybody kept to
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was really a lot of paranoia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's a snitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, people got busted for,
you know, seeds and stems and not a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, no, a lot of people just try to
keep to themselves or they get busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you, if you didn't know
anything, you couldn't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much understandable given the harsh
penalties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I'm wondering, A, how did you
get the name Snow High?
[SPEAKER_00]: And B, when did you decide you wanted to
start sort of formally breeding and giving
[SPEAKER_00]: your seeds out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, his name, his name Snow High came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend, uh, Dustin, um, and I,
he was growing the snow cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got, um, one of the first clones out of
Fort Bragg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the growers in Mendocino were
done growing it and no one else was
[SPEAKER_02]: growing it in Lake County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so when I was, uh, it came online in
the early 2000s, um, it was just the
[SPEAKER_02]: strain that he had been growing that,
um, I was selling down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I just used the name to see how
many people were familiar with the strain
[SPEAKER_02]: to see how prolific it was around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not many people had known about it,
not at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so it just happened to be the name I
used at the time with the, the strain I
[SPEAKER_02]: was selling, which was a really tasty,
good strain, uh, at least the first
[SPEAKER_02]: version of it that came out because it
soon became hybridized and the taste and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything went downhill.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the, the real true snow cap was
mentholated, minty, menthol, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: candied, um, you know, winter green type,
uh, smell and taste and flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, tropical candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very tasty and resonance,
uh, had a great, fantastic high,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and grew nice big spears and this,
you know, it was a, it was a good,
[SPEAKER_02]: good plant, but, um, it was really good at
being, um, able to deal with humidity and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people were growing it in Fort Bragg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my father's uncle or cousin was
growing it in the town of Mendocino and
[SPEAKER_02]: the fog bank was so thick and Mendocino,
the town of Mendocino, that the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: were dripping with, um, with condensation,
just dripping because the sun was blocked
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could barely see the sun because it
was like a little, uh, ring of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a little bit of light,
but it was so thick with haze and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, moisture on the coast of Mendocino
because it's right off the coast of
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern California with all the redwoods.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but these plants, these, um,
snow cap hybrids were growing under like
[SPEAKER_02]: pure condensation and he was taking a
bleach water solution, spraying the plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's how he was able to grow with
like almost no light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing, but those hybrids became
more, uh, prevalent and the majority of
[SPEAKER_02]: people that got what they thought was
like, um, snow cap was this hybridized
[SPEAKER_02]: version.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of, the real stuff kind of wasn't
available to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that's the, the high was basically
a snow cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, me saying snow high,
I guess I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just adapted the snow highs,
no caps, no high thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that Bodie convinced me to,
um, to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was basically, you know, selling to the
clubs and doing my own preservation work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, doing stuff for fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and my family's homes were,
uh, being, you know, the, the banks were
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to collect from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, family went through some, uh,
times where they were in the hospital and
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't able to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I tried to save my family's,
um, properties by selling herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did that for a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of got me into selling the
herb to save their homes, um, which I was
[SPEAKER_02]: able to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, seed stuff just kind of
evolved with that as well, but mainly kept
[SPEAKER_02]: in place for fun and, uh, trying to do
preservation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there a difference between
legendary genetics and snow high seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, uh, legendary genetics was supposed
to be for, uh, California and snow high
[SPEAKER_02]: for the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when the, uh, you know, clubs went
legal, the problems with COVID,
[SPEAKER_02]: COVID kind of destroyed all the,
the business that was going to be done and
[SPEAKER_02]: established at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of, um, the work that Bodhi,
uh, Kagyu and coastal seeds and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, myself, we were going to be,
uh, in the clubs in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, unfortunately COVID happened right
when we were getting into all these clubs,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the clubs went out of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the seed stock that went into these
places was lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so all that time money, an effort was
lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but there was supposed to be a,
uh, a separation of the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could do something here in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then something for the world that
was already done previous to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, COVID destroyed a lot of
stuff and, um, trying to, uh, get back to,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, work is a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people had to do that,
you know, start over, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: deal with their losses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I've had health problems,
um, along the way as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a double whammy when you're not
well and trying to do things that,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, take effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the questions we got submitted
quite a fair bit from the viewers across
[SPEAKER_00]: both Instagram and Patreon was that they
were wondering these days, how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: source new genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find it's becoming increasingly
more difficult to find good sources for
[SPEAKER_00]: stock?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've always been the type that I help
out my friends and my friends helped me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I try to be good to people and then
people are also good to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it's kind of a karma thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, if you're just trying to do,
uh, your intentions are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, you should get something
back with the good intentions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I don't find it hard to find new
genetics, but it's also, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics that just need to be preserved
already that still need work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so there's no, there's, there's no
time to lose.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of work to be done and not
enough time to do it.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, would you advocate that
people should be open to the idea of like
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe traveling to some of these native
zones where they come from and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing their own little expeditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you feel like overall it's,
it's probably too diluted and like maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to find real stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on what kind of person you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some places that are, you know,
historically cannabis producing places
[SPEAKER_02]: have been dangerous for some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on your level of,
um, danger, uh, your ability to deal with
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases, um, lack of food, uh,
lack of services, um, may affect your
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to go and get some of these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, other times you can even go on a trip
and find certain things, but it just
[SPEAKER_02]: depends on, um, how you're trying to
source things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you trying to get it from a reseller
or are you trying to go directly to the
[SPEAKER_02]: grower up in the Hills?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sometimes going directly to the Hills
won't work because they've already sold
[SPEAKER_02]: what they had to the resellers that sell
them at the beach, let's say in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you go to the highlands of Oaxaca,
you may not find anything there because
[SPEAKER_02]: they've already sold everything that has
been sold that, you know, uh, the local
[SPEAKER_02]: beaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then the, the cartels are
something to deal with because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you could end up with,
uh, your body's head cut off or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that because you're in the wrong
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's a, this depends on the country,
uh, the place you're trying to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I mean, a lot of these,
there's a lot of countries and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: places that a lot of the varieties are
disappearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were historically trying to help
these people, uh, documentation,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and, and helping them is a way that
people could do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, we're trying to figure out
ways of doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are trying to help the people
by providing, you know, vegetable seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, a way to sell those, uh,
those foods and try to make something for
[SPEAKER_02]: those communities so they can be
preserved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, unfortunately a lot of, um,
cannabis producing areas have gone to like
[SPEAKER_02]: poppies or other things because they're
just trying to survive because of drought,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, because of the, um, the laws,
um, or the, the racism that's gone on that
[SPEAKER_02]: kills like indigenous peoples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, so we, we need to say what's here
before it's lost because every year things
[SPEAKER_02]: lost even a few years ago, uh,
certain places that are producing cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: are producing cannabis anymore,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so there's, there's, there's a lot of
loss and these people need help and their
[SPEAKER_02]: history needs to be preserved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I'd say you could go to certain
places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, um, sometimes you may be going to
a place that, uh, you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to find anything anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to do your homework and,
um, there's gotta be ways that we could
[SPEAKER_02]: actually help each other and help these
indigenous peoples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I think eventually we're working
with like-minded people around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we can help.
[SPEAKER_02]: These communities a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and maybe like a global seed bank,
which the funds will actually trickle down
[SPEAKER_02]: to the people actually should get it,
not just the people at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that something like that will
happen or it might be like difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of get people on board?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I, I think it should happen and it
could happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it just has to have the right people
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on
the recent legalization by the Thai
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've often sort of in recent weeks sat and
wondered to myself if there would be like
[SPEAKER_00]: a resurgence in sort of Thai terroir
produced landrace and, and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if the quality of it would be any good,
or do you suspect like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people over there just going to grow like
modern, you know, stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the terroir type stuff would be
beneficial on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be good for the people, uh,
along the borders.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you have the indigenous people
that were, you know, growing these
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they've been forced from place to
place anyway, um, for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, there should be protection for
these people and there should be,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, ability, ability for these people to
grow some things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they're growing hemp on an island,
uh, you know, and destroying the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the lines that were indigenous to
that area or acclimatized to that area,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, it's kind of be like counter-defeating
the issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, like anything, the people
that are going to be able to grow these
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties, usually the ones that have
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's a tough thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be kind of like, um,
a protection as well as, um, like a
[SPEAKER_02]: historical type thing where we have
preserved the knowledge of the people as
[SPEAKER_02]: long with the strains, because it's like,
um, you know, it's like growable history,
[SPEAKER_02]: these varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so there should be protection and,
uh, the legalization will impart good
[SPEAKER_02]: things and bad things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm certainly interested to see how it
plays out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be, um, it'll be really cool to see
if they started pumping out like some,
[SPEAKER_00]: like really intentionally farmed Thai land
race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what, what a treasure that would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm actually trying to work with
some of the people there, um, that are
[SPEAKER_02]: there now on, you know, things like that
as we speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the stuff I'm growing right now
is from some of the resurgence of the Thai
[SPEAKER_02]: lines there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Preservation ties, uh, analyzing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is being worked on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I hope that we can do more of it and
then make it so that they are preserved
[SPEAKER_02]: and not just, you know, it's just a,
a, a graph of genetics because it's more
[SPEAKER_02]: important than just the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the people, it's the history.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's more to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I hope to, to be able to help
some of that as if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I'm sure you're going to have a
monumentally positive impact in it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of curiosity, would you look to go in
there and want to sort of try to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: tie that's there that might be available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you want to bring in like some of
your own stuff that you think,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this may not even exist there anymore?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's, there's always that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's enough Thai varieties
there that they have enough, but there
[SPEAKER_02]: might be a few that maybe need to be
reintroduced, but the majority of stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: they already have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some places around the world,
I've tried to introduce stuff that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: lost, like in New Mexico, a lot of the
varieties that they once had needed to be
[SPEAKER_02]: re reintroduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've tried to, um, send seeds to places
that, um, these varieties originally came
[SPEAKER_02]: from and try to get them reestablished in
the property.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same thing with Hawaiian varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to send, um, Hawaiian
lines to people in Hawaii to get them to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow these lines again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know if it's, um, naive or
not, but, um, you know, hopefully there'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be some kind of resurgence for these
varieties being grown in a place of
[SPEAKER_02]: origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawaii is kind of like not the same thing,
but, um, the idea is to bring back old
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties like gold and the greros and the
mutual cons and have them grown by the
[SPEAKER_02]: people that have lost them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them have tried to get them out of
the country to save them because the
[SPEAKER_02]: cartels have basically forced them to stop
growing, uh, these varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but they're trying to get them out to
preserve them or protect them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the cartels are usually like young
kids, like, you know, 12, 13, 16 year olds
[SPEAKER_02]: all methed out and, you know, they create
like their own gangs, like Zetas and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these are just young kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, unfortunately, and they, they get all
methed out and they go attack other groups
[SPEAKER_02]: and kill each other and they get savage
because they've been on meth for so many
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks and months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but they also destroy, you know,
the canvas production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they go to poppies or something
else that's, you know, quick to make
[SPEAKER_02]: money, unfortunately, but these,
these lost lines need to be reintroduced
[SPEAKER_02]: and saved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I think the only way to do it is
to kind of reproduce them somewhere else
[SPEAKER_02]: and then bring it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hopefully when things have
stabilized somewhat, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: have it spread to more of these farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that should be done in Thailand and
other places, but, uh, some of it should
[SPEAKER_02]: be maintained and, you know, you shouldn't
be bringing things, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: like if you're on a strain hunting,
uh, so far you shouldn't be bringing your
[SPEAKER_02]: hybridized Dutch varieties and giving it
to the locals because it just pollutes the
[SPEAKER_02]: gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm so glad you touched on that
because that was going to be the next
[SPEAKER_00]: question about our Dutch friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I would love to quickly touch on,
because I, we've had this discussion with
[SPEAKER_00]: a few people in the past, but someone
mentioned, you know, what are you,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you meant to take them if you're
not going to take them seeds and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should delve into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegetable seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it depends on that place.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like in Nepal, Bodhi was trading
them vegetable seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: something that they can grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not bringing in an invasive
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get the seeds there locally,
um, but you're just providing more of
[SPEAKER_02]: what's already there to farmers that have,
you know, no money or little money and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're providing something that can grow
for food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, food's always something that's,
you know, we take for granted because we
[SPEAKER_02]: have supermarkets and most places around
the world, they don't have supermarkets,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, even in Italy, you have like
markets, but they don't have like what we
[SPEAKER_02]: do in the United States or in other
countries where you can have these big,
[SPEAKER_02]: huge places with all these different foods
and meats and availability.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just live so much higher, uh,
lives than a lot of people do around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take for granted that, you know,
seed stock of vegetables is, is desirable
[SPEAKER_02]: and much needed and food in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, that would be one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, you find something that could be,
um, used by them that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't take up a lot of room seeds,
as long as they're not, um, brought in
[SPEAKER_02]: from another country and have diseases or
pests, which can be negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you don't want to bring stuff
from your country because you can bring in
[SPEAKER_02]: invasive insects like stuff from China.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people are getting seeds from China,
a lot of those have like weevils and mites
[SPEAKER_02]: and different things that could destroy
your seeds and destroy your stocks stocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, freezing your seeds before you
bring them in would be important,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you should do that for all kinds of
seeds that you're bringing in from another
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's why they have these,
uh, sanitation certificates.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you're supposed to use when importing
seeds from other countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important because you know,
you're bringing in pests and you could be
[SPEAKER_02]: the one that was responsible for a plague,
uh, you know, insects that are bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: that certain fungus that's killing all the
different citrus fruits or trees because
[SPEAKER_02]: you bought in Canada seeds from somewhere,
you know, that has this, this type of
[SPEAKER_02]: insect that has this type of mold with it,
you know, or this virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's all connected, but if you get
something from that country, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: usually safe and, um, you can buy it in
bulk, you know, it's not too expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you bring it to the people or you
find something that you could trade with
[SPEAKER_02]: them that they want, but those would be
better things than providing genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: that, um, can pollute their, what they
already have.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they have sources to, you know,
uh, international genetics already,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, they can also import them themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they can import that and dilute
their, their, uh, gene pool by themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need the extra help from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There definitely are people out there in,
uh, these land race areas who are keen to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow some California and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess there needs to be some
acceptance of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a follow up to the last one,
if you were, you know, totally relieved of
[SPEAKER_00]: all responsibilities and were totally able
to go anywhere, do a land race expedition,
[SPEAKER_00]: where would you want to head off to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, before the, uh, the government went
haywire, I wanted to go to Myanmar,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, what was previously Burma and explore,
uh, all that because, um, there are so
[SPEAKER_02]: many, uh, temples and there's quite a
large country in, you know, between India
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, you know, Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so it, you know, a lot of explored
varieties could have been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of different indigenous
peoples groups that are kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, been cut off from the rest of
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like a, um, we call it
like a time capsule, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: these people, uh, are living in decades,
you know, or hundreds of decades behind
[SPEAKER_02]: some of us in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, finding some interesting stuff
there would have been pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, Africa going to the Congolese
Basin countries, uh, a lot of that stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: has been, uh, pretty, um, pretty hard to
get into.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, as far as the diseases and,
uh, just the unruliness of the guerrilla
[SPEAKER_02]: type, um, you know, armies in there,
uh, it's it's really a hard place to get
[SPEAKER_02]: into.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that's been kind of, um,
strange because the Belgian people had
[SPEAKER_02]: gone there and tried to take over the
Congo years ago and they had, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of hemp varieties that
were escaped cultivars into the Congolese
[SPEAKER_02]: Congo and the Congolese Basin countries
that surround it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so a lot of people that think these,
there's indigenous sativas there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it might be, uh, escaped hemp
cultivars that, um, you know, acclimatized
[SPEAKER_02]: to the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, another place would be some of the,
um, South African or South American
[SPEAKER_02]: countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I definitely like to go back into
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, been there a couple of times and
trying to find things, but Mexico,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, would love to find some more stuff
down there, down to Columbia, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: Bolivia, Peru, uh, that all be,
uh, fun places to go looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you touched on, um, you know,
a magical talking point, which was that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to ask you about what's your
opinions on the Congolese, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't see them represented too much,
but they are some really special strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the, there is, um, there's the,
there's the pygmy peoples there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's several different groups of
pygmies that are in the Congolese Basin
[SPEAKER_02]: countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I'll, I'll, I'll make this
reference in Egypt.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had their gods and one of their gods
was named Bess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bess was a pygmy, um, dark skinned pygmy,
and he was a fertility god.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in their fertility, um, bases,
they would find, um, cannabis residue and
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the pygmies were from the Congolese
Basin country.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't from like where Egypt was
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so they must've seen that these
indigenous pygmies were consuming,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they were using it for child
birthing, you know, for the pain and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were using it in the ancient past
for that purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the other people that were,
uh, a close relative to the pygmy people
[SPEAKER_02]: were the Kalahari Bush people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are some of the oldest known,
the oldest, like people living on earth
[SPEAKER_02]: that are closest to modern humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you know, still a distant,
um, human, and these people are closest
[SPEAKER_02]: related to the pygmy people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it seems like these, the Kalahari
Bushmen, um, have a cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but their, their genetics go back to a
very old age.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it seems like they left,
um, Africa, um, maybe 76,000 years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: up to 130,000 years ago, and then went
into like Southeast Asia and then back to
[SPEAKER_02]: South Africa, um, during like floods of
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we're talking about a timeframe of
like 130,000 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then you see in their genetics,
if you see a picture of a Kalahari
[SPEAKER_02]: Bushman, you see that they have Asian um,
features, like from China or Laos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then I, and in the early nineties
or early two thousands, I was looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: DNA because they did the whole genome
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found that these people have,
um, Asian descent back, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: from like 70 to 130,000 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically the genetic testing confirmed
what I saw in the pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I also looked up the phonetic words
for cannabis that were similar to these
[SPEAKER_02]: Kalahari Bushmen, uh, for the same use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I looked it up phonetically,
then I looked up the pictures of these
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I backed it up with genetic
sequencing, um, that they left,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, Africa and then came back,
um, you know, at one point, which was kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys have time, look up the San
people or the Kalahari Bushmen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see that they have like Asian
descent, but these are black indigenous,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Africans, and there's supposed to be
like the oldest living, uh, people on
[SPEAKER_02]: earth, um, that are like, you know,
been in the same place, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: from time immemorial, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my thoughts are that cannabis left
Africa with them or with other indigenous
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how it spread around the world
is from Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, went to the Americas,
uh, went through, uh, Africa through the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle East up through the Khyber pass
through Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan up into China up through India
and Southeast Asia, and then down through
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia and then land bridges to
America's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's a lot of, um, knowledge and
genetics that show, uh, travel during the
[SPEAKER_02]: low, um, the times when the waters were
lower and there was more islands that
[SPEAKER_02]: there was more, um, trans Pacific,
um, migration of peoples, like some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: people that are in Mexico kind of like,
uh, they look like some of the Africans
[SPEAKER_02]: from, uh, Western Africa around Senegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and these are some of like the oldest,
um, Mexican peoples and the, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Americas basically attract all these
old people, ancient civilizations and
[SPEAKER_02]: found a lot of cannabis history among
almost all of the ancient civilizations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's in the book I wrote, which I'm
still trying to finish up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a book on all this craziness as
well, but it needs to be finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any idea of when, you know, mine sort of
be looking to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hopefully next year or so,
but maybe sooner it's been done,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the, the, the publisher said it was
too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I separated it into two books.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first book is called, uh,
the tree of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically, um, talks about the
two, um, the trees that were in the garden
[SPEAKER_02]: of Eden.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was the tree of knowledge and one was
the tree of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I based the tree of knowledge being the
varieties that give you, um, knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the tree of life being the
varieties that give you, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: life, like, uh, you know, healing
properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of separate the two and the two
books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of like psychedelics and cannabis
sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're both cannabis, but more of
like, uh, the, the varieties that give you
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge and the ones that kind of have
more healing properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've kind of separated them like the
Indica hash plants into one book and like
[SPEAKER_02]: this team is tutorials, Mexicans and all
that to another book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of splitting up the cannabis
genome into kind of two different
[SPEAKER_02]: sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something to look forward to in the
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully as long as my health keeps up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, yeah, that should be,
uh, something to kind of put my knowledge
[SPEAKER_02]: down on paper and kind of give people some
interesting history to, uh, to look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause everybody loves history as long as,
as well as cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much there that people are just
not aware of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, kind of highlighting some of
it's kind of a cool thing to do to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during your answer, you referenced,
uh, you know, the, the migration of things
[SPEAKER_00]: down to Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'd be interested to know is earlier
on in the interview, you also referenced
[SPEAKER_00]: Muller Madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on Muller Madness?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you know if it has any relation to
old mother Sativa or if they're quite
[SPEAKER_00]: different?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't, I haven't grown old
mother Sativa, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but a lot of those lines were,
there was a lot of Thai varieties,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, Colombians, uh, that were,
uh, grown in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of Southeast Asian
varieties grown there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so from the Muller Madness,
it has a certain, um, growth structure
[SPEAKER_02]: that was, um, similar to, uh, the,
the Neville's haze that I saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that's why I was coming up with,
you know, thinking that Muller Madness
[SPEAKER_02]: might be the source of, um, like the
Neville's haze instead of it being like,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, like a haze variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, the, the Muller Madness,
uh, has this upright structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to take some pictures of it and
you can see it's got a certain growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: similar to Zamal where it's kind of like
an upright plant, lots of shoots,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, lots of smaller flowers coming up from
it, but it's got a certain growth look to
[SPEAKER_02]: it, um, when it's flowering out,
like an upright plant, um, just unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so maybe it's coming from some of the
Thai varieties that, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but Australia's got some very good,
uh, varieties, you know, from the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Thai lines, the, the, the closeness to
Papua New Guinea.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of varieties from Papua New
Guinea, um, the surrounding islands,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, Malaysia, uh, there's a lot of small
stuff that's, you know, been through
[SPEAKER_02]: Indonesia that, you know, because of the
drug laws, they're so stringent that not
[SPEAKER_02]: much of it gets out of there, but like
Sumatra and Indonesia, Malaysia,
[SPEAKER_02]: there were some good varieties,
but they don't get any, um, knowledge of
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the drug laws, you know,
and you don't want to be came to death.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not, not a cool thing for smoking
cannabis or having a couple of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but there's a lot of cool stuff that,
you know, Australia do the proximity has
[SPEAKER_02]: been able to get, um, and create some
really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you look at the, the size of the
plants that grow in Australia,
[SPEAKER_02]: the trees, the trees has some growth with
the eucalyptus and some of the other trees
[SPEAKER_02]: that grow so large, so fast that cannabis
that grows there also has some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so acclimatizing stuff to Australia
and then growing them elsewhere would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: great thing for, uh, some of the cannabis
breeders because of just the, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the environment, um, of Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard it guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy some of my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kidding around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a nice, uh, pool of fans
submitted questions here, but before we
[SPEAKER_00]: get into them, I wanted to ask you this
one might be hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe should have given it to you earlier
to think about, but how would you rank the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall hierarchy of hazes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say that, I mean, heck,
you could just say like Colombian at the
[SPEAKER_00]: top or something, but you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the people who say they like haze,
what's the hierarchy for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the number one?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how would you sort of rank them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a really tough question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know if I can answer it,
uh, honestly, because, uh, I just,
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's a good answer as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in, in depending on the
phenotype or the plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they could be a little bit different or
something special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, uh, especially like the purple haze,
um, phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I like the, um, the profile,
the turpins, because they have this,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, uh, this port wine, you know,
this grapey port liqueur, um, turpent
[SPEAKER_02]: profile, which kind of, um, like a
blackberry port wine liqueur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, aroma and taste, but, uh, the high is,
um, luxurious, transcending, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: mind expanding psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it just, the flavors and tastes
just, uh, you know, make it luxurious and
[SPEAKER_02]: the effects it, it just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, um, the old timers hazes,
which is not like real haze, but it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like a haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those Colombians are very special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but some of the hazes that were,
uh, like original haze are very good too,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's a different type of effect,
but they're also very special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry for the shitty answer guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did notice in your catalog, you had,
uh, the black raspberry haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little more about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the black raspberry haze,
it was, uh, it was just called black
[SPEAKER_02]: raspberry at one time, but I didn't
realize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bodie had, um, a black raspberry,
um, he had named his right before mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put the haze because it has the
purple tie nevels haze in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's basically the Maduro,
which is Oregon purple tie line braid,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, done by, um, RC Colas in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he basically, uh, bred the Oregon
purple tie traits out and made them more,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, uh, forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the line and he grew the line out of,
um, a blue moonshine and then another
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon purple tie variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then pulled out the traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Maduro is an Oregon purple tie
dominant, um, variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used, um, a couple of phenotypes for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they turned purple and blue and red,
um, when I was growing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were the mothers I used for the
black raspberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the male I chose, um,
was the one that has the purple,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, trichomes on the, the sepals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the male flowers that have the little
pollen sacks had, uh, standing trichomes,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, which is not too usual for male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were purple coloration of the
resin glands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I use that male on the Maduro
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's Oregon purple tie, uh,
with the Neville's haze purple tie male
[SPEAKER_02]: line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's an F3 Neville's haze with the
purple tie and the Oregon purple tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a real special tie Neville's haze
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, the black raspberry haze,
um, grows into these pink and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, purple red, um, colored buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get these nice pink purple buds,
but the resins that extracted from it have
[SPEAKER_02]: that color too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They retain that color.
[SPEAKER_02]: So extracts will have this like raspberry,
um, you know, raspberry color,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, like, um, sham board, you know,
that raspberry liqueur has that color to
[SPEAKER_02]: the extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can make extracts that have this
raspberry, uh, color to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes a wonderful, uh, awesome high
and the tasty, um, delectable,
[SPEAKER_02]: sweet candied, um, like raspberry taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's got that nice haze high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one person said it was the best high
you ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I said, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the, the color and the special
trichome resins that it produces is very
[SPEAKER_02]: special.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's a very good line to have in
order to smoke, great for breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: great for smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of those you want to keep to
yourself and share with special friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just while we're talking about the
backstory of hazes quickly, I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: this one's not made by you, but I have a
feeling you might be able to give me a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of the backstory, but can you tell me
about the metal haze?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's not a ton of information
about the backstory and you have used it
[SPEAKER_00]: for a few different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, metal haze was done by Dutch
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's a very potent line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there was, you know, a couple of
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the phenotype that I got was one
selected by the rev.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he got the seeds from my friend for
dragons, um, and he got them from the
[SPEAKER_02]: auctions and there wasn't many packs sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there wasn't much metal haze that was
actually available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, uh, rev only, uh,
um, selected the one female and then,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, called the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so there wasn't any to breed with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried to take some F2 metal haze that I
had to breed it with F1, but all I had
[SPEAKER_02]: was, um, uh, females.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never got a male, so I wasn't able to
breed the F2s to F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the metal haze, when I've looked at
it and growing it out, um, and seeing the
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions through recessives,
it looks like it's supposed to be a mix
[SPEAKER_02]: of, uh, a bunch of their sativas or haze
plants that they were growing under metal
[SPEAKER_02]: halide, uh, lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but what I saw from growing it out,
it, it looks like it's got Mexican,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, Punto Rojo in there from the leaf
structures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think some of the, the metal haze,
um, with the special parts that is a
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexican Punto Rojo, but that's just my,
uh, interpretation of the leaves and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, some of the aspects they get
from the stems and the coloration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just from, you know,
years of growing different varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be off, but that's what it
looks like to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have one called Dr. Doom,
which is the metal dragon, which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: metal haze with the Burmese, um,
and purple Vietnamese, which is a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: purple phenotype, which is Vietnamese with
Vietnam black.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, the Mexican Punto Rojo traits
seem to be pretty dominant in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's going to be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some growing this year, so it's
going to be, can't wait till those are
[SPEAKER_02]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we'll move on to the, uh, the fan
submitted questions before we finally wrap
[SPEAKER_00]: up with the final five.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give people the first one we got is a
good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone must be paying a lot of attention
because I didn't even know about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they said, can you ask Snow High if he
can tell us a little bit about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rare hemp seeds he has specifically?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he has some Fujian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Fujian it's a, there's a province in
China.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there it's not Fiji.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from, uh, it's a province in China.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I've got a lot of different hemp
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I've got, uh, maybe 120
different hemp strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them from China, a lot of them
from, you know, um, uh, Hungary,
[SPEAKER_02]: Romania, um, some from the Congo,
um, some from, uh, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, all the different Russia, I have stuff
from Siberia, um, um, Mongolia,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a lot of different hemp all the
way to like Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's Southern Italian varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, um, um, Slovenian, Slovakian,
there's Czech, there is, um, French,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, Spanish, um, there's Latvian,
there is, um, yeah, basically I've got a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of different, it's Turkish,
all these different hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, even I have some from North
Korea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You managed to get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were collected, um, in the 1950s,
um, or before the, right before the Korean
[SPEAKER_02]: war.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two varieties and they need to be
preserved because, uh, they may be getting
[SPEAKER_02]: unviable at this point, but, um,
I, yeah, I was trying to do, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, a preservation of hemp varieties as
well, because I think I like all cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and can, there's so many different things
we could do for the world with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, as far as medicine or,
um, you know, supplements or, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: building materials, um, plastics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's so much in these hemp
varieties will be, uh, just as valuable
[SPEAKER_02]: as, you know, these drug producing
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not only that you could have,
um, you know, disease, resistance in some
[SPEAKER_02]: of these hemp varieties that may be lost
in some of these, I know, drug varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: and that you can incorporate some of those
resistances, um, and pest resistances into
[SPEAKER_02]: these, you know, drug types that might be
favorable to certain places in the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: or we can produce a hemp variety that will
grow in a tropical place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, um, heat tends to make even
drug cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, hemp cultivars into,
um, like ganja, uh, because the heat
[SPEAKER_02]: changes the, the environment, it
acclimatizes to that environment and then
[SPEAKER_02]: it produces THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what happened in the Congo with,
uh, Belgian varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's really cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't really heard that expressed
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the next questions we got is,
uh, someone says right now from sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the menu, the current offerings that
Snowhi has, what's his favorite and why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, um, too many favorites, but one of my
favorites right now is for a long time is
[SPEAKER_02]: called the devil's tit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, basically when I first smoked the
parents, uh, the devil came to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: whispered in my ear and told me what to
call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, devil's tit is Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was from a, a clone from Mendocino that
I got from, um, guy that was an old
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder that, uh, bred heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he, he didn't have that, but he,
his friends had the Durban that I got it
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So associate of that person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, uh, this Durban poison was,
uh, some of the most potent herb I've
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked to date.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it turns purple, has orange hairs,
red stems, and the, the devil's tit has
[SPEAKER_02]: imparted those properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, extracts from it are so powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've been in fetal positions because
it's been too strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I've heard that from a lot of
people that the, the, it's just too potent
[SPEAKER_02]: for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, and that, that's not
necessarily a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke less and sometimes, you know,
you just need to dose yourself a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit less and you're fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the fourth effects, the, the taste is
like strawberry lemonade or cherry
[SPEAKER_02]: chapstick, or there's a skunk phenotype as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, all very, uh, rich in terpenes and,
um, THC doesn't seem to be too high in
[SPEAKER_02]: that, in the test results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's something else in that that
makes it extremely potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know it's THCV or what it is,
but something in the devil's tit,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, makes it very, very potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and not all lab tests are conclusive
because, uh, you know, when I was testing
[SPEAKER_02]: things at the animal cup, they weren't
testing for THCV and some other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a problem with a lot of labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't always test for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, unfortunately, but, um, that was one
of my favorites because it's, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some faster phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it yields well, it's got, you know,
the, the looks and smells and tastes,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything wants, and it's, it's got the
potency beyond and it's got a quality to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it can be a roller coaster,
but it's a fun roller coaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that description.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question we have is someone wants
to know what strain do you have that's got
[SPEAKER_00]: the most unique terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow up, what sort of terpene
profiles are you most interested in at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, unique terpens.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a Mexican variety, um,
called El Primo, which is a Mexican Punto
[SPEAKER_02]: Rojo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, uh, it's got what I believe it's
got this, um, the simple terpene profile
[SPEAKER_02]: that is a fuel like aroma profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's, it's basically what I think
when people smell the chem lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: they smell this simple terpene profile and
that's what they love out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the unadulterated mixed up what
they love out of the chem lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that fuely smell, but it's not,
it's not a sour diesel or any smell like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just got that simple fuel terpene
profile, which is very unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's, um, psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very luxurious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's in simpleized form.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's the building block for what we
love, um, in some of these lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's coming out of that Mexican Punto
Rojo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's surprising because it's coming
out of a Mexican cultivar and it's unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's, you know, what a lot
of people, you know, been digging around
[SPEAKER_02]: for and can't find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's in one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So El Primo is, um, the line that,
um, I found it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, if people are looking for,
to recreate some of the chem lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's where it's from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I also think I have, um, what,
created the, uh, the chem lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: the dog, but, uh, I think my friend made
it and he, um, he just didn't realize
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what he made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He called it something else, the mongrel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was also renamed the, the,
the dog, but, but he called it the mongrel
[SPEAKER_02]: because it was a mix of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that may just be one version of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I have the seeds and I try to grow
them out and see what it comes out of
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're older, so we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did he describe it as the plants sort
of how were they like Indica sativa?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indicas and sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're a mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he said it was like five different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: He called it the mongrel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have the mongrel seeds and I have the
dog, but seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, uh, you know, and these dog,
but crosses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll see if any of those will,
um, we'll make it, we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: germinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what comes out of them if
they're similar or what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wait with bated breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, if you had to guess the
exact sort of genetics that were in chem
[SPEAKER_00]: dog, what would you say it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'd have to say that there would
have to be some Mexican in it from my,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, finding this Mexican Punturojo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some Mexican, um, Afghani, um,
probably Pakistani, uh, probably some kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of Southeast Asian in there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, something that I've been
discussing more with people like Skunk VA
[SPEAKER_00]: and some of the people who are very
associated with the chem dogs is that a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people will talk about them as if
they're like this most hardcore indica,
[SPEAKER_00]: but many of them do have a decent amount
of sort of sativa like traits to them and
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects to the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just so potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sort of sometimes feel like it's
indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mexican comes along and it's super
potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the chem qualities, but the
Afghani kind of, I would think would go
[SPEAKER_02]: along.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you wanted to reproduce the chem
line, um, with that Mexican Punturojo and
[SPEAKER_02]: add some certain specific Afghanis,
you'd have something pretty close,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the mongrel, I think was like five
different things, but, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's the, I'm sure more than one person
may dog, but the whole thing is no one is
[SPEAKER_02]: claiming this and nobody knows where it
came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why not my friend that did some work
around the same time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people got seeds from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot of people got seeds from him and
then he, because he got busted,
[SPEAKER_02]: he kind of went out of the, um,
you know, from growing for a while and he
[SPEAKER_02]: had heart, he's got heart conditions and
issues like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it'd be interesting if that's what
it is, but you know, who knows,
[SPEAKER_02]: there might be some other person that
created dog, but, and there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: other dog lines out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's dog shit and there's, you know,
lots of people come up with the same name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wouldn't be unlikely that more than
one person created the same thing or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that was named the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not saying it is, but, uh, I might dig
down the hole and see what comes out of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I'm keen to follow your progress and
see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question we got was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the most paranoia inducing weed
you've ever bred?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of your strains, someone wants to
get paranoid by the sounds of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paranoid inducing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there was, um, one I grew that has
Senegalese with haze and, um, Oh God,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was Angola red with the tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did one with Senegalese haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, um, Angola tie with Angola red and
it was Angola red tie, um, Senegalese and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, like, uh, Neville's haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that was one of the strongest
paranoid inducing ones mostly was,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, from African sativas, equatorial
blinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you don't really see too many people
playing with them outside of like yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe GUI breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: GUI is not too far from, you know,
from where I grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the same area, Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever grown mom GUI at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, GUI is very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I did some work with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to grow out some of those seeds,
but yeah, it's definitely a producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got some wonderful buds on there and
yeah, it's, it's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good stuff to grow and breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question we had was what's
your thoughts on the Makaito and how was
[SPEAKER_00]: the strain collected?
[SPEAKER_00]: Makaito?
[SPEAKER_02]: God, you know, I heard that was,
it was like a Scunk Northern Lights haze
[SPEAKER_02]: combination, kind of like Jack hair,
but other than that, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely strong and it's got some
unique traits to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, look, I feel you on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, someone says, can you give us some
insight into your process of harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichomes from seeded bud with dry
ice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, very easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, um, a lot of people are
like, I don't, I can't try my,
[SPEAKER_02]: my, my strains because I seed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you're, if you seed your lines,
you basically take a seeded buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you use dry ice with, um,
say, um, um, the, the, the, the bubble
[SPEAKER_02]: bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you use, uh, I think 130 trichomes,
uh, sorry, millimeters high, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: centimeters, uh, micro mesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 130, uh, micro mesh bag, and you put it
in, put your seeded buds in there with the
[SPEAKER_02]: dry ice crushed up and you take like a
packet and you flip it upside down and
[SPEAKER_02]: shake that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, over, um, you know, something that you
can collect the resin glands out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can basically separate even fresh bud,
um, fresh bud works great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because then you have like,
uh, you know, that fresh, um, dry,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, sieve and it's, it's, it hasn't been
decarboxylated yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you can use fresh buds,
which are great, or you can use the dry
[SPEAKER_02]: buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The good thing is you can separate the
seeds and they're clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got this nice, um,
fresh resin that you shake off from,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I use the 130 because it kind of,
you know, like gives you the smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: microns and the larger, um, mesh,
you know, it kind of takes out the dust,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it allows you to get the resin glands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you collect that with, um,
you know, um, a credit card or some kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of other card.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I, I usually shake them over,
you know, a plastic drum that used for
[SPEAKER_02]: like collecting oil or something,
some big plastic thing you can kind of lay
[SPEAKER_02]: down and collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna have to try that next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can, you can shake out your resin
glands within a few minutes, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and collect them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a fast way of collecting resin
glands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you separate your seeds
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, if you wanted to separate the
seeds from all the trash and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can use, um, a two liter Coke bottle,
cut up with strips and a vacuum,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, uh, connected to the back end of the
two liter bottle and the bottom cut off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you kind of, um, can feed off the,
the trashy, uh, sticks and everything that
[SPEAKER_02]: are associated with your seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what will be left behind are the
seeds because they, they have a density
[SPEAKER_02]: and weight to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a good way of cleaning your seeds
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cleaning seeds right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to implement this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you a picture of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, um, you know, I'll show you what
it looks like and kind of explain to you
[SPEAKER_02]: how the breakdown, it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of build a little adapter to put
on the back end of the vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can use your vacuum with it fastest
way to deseed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onto the last few fans submitted
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is what's the most unique
land race experience you've had?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unique, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got me stumped on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I love the, oh, the Thai buds,
you know, it's the sweet taste of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Thai, uh, like the dry, you know,
it looks like, you know, what we used to
[SPEAKER_02]: get as Thai sticks or Thai buds,
the sweet taste, the high was just your
[SPEAKER_02]: fork and soaring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just that wonderful, um,
this high and it tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Thai buds are just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, compared to other stuff,
but, um, you know, I love Mexicans as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's the psychedelic potency,
the quality, the giggles, the happiness
[SPEAKER_02]: from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd say it's a draw between Thai Thai,
Thai, Thai sticks and Thai, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: and Mexican, um, stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had some stuff from Veracruz that
was a so psychedelic and potent,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, that it, it can be annoyed inducing as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very paranoid inducing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember being in Cancun and,
um, smoking a big old, uh, joint outside
[SPEAKER_02]: the window.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when the, uh, federal is the
guys, the cops there, uh, shined his
[SPEAKER_02]: lights and at me because I was smoking
outside the window.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he was trying to scare me and
fuck with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got me all paranoid because I was
smoking this, you know, strong ass weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that ended up flushing the rest of it
down the toilet after smoking half the
[SPEAKER_02]: joint, but it was legal at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I was just, uh, you know,
got overtaken by the paranoid inducing
[SPEAKER_02]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You touched on the tie there because one
of the questions we go is, have you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: found any interesting terpenes in the tie
lines besides the standard sort of spicy
[SPEAKER_00]: haze or the lemon that you commonly see?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, I mean, there's juicy fruit tie,
which has got like a different fruity
[SPEAKER_02]: aroma and taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows different too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it's more of an upright,
um, bilateral, like it grows, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, what I would consider like a golden
tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some of these golden, the stuff with
the gold, the golden tie, gold king tie,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, it's grows in like a, an upright
straight plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some of these ties, I don't,
it's hard to say they're kind of like a
[SPEAKER_02]: bean pole.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow straight up and they have,
um, branching that's, um, um, basically
[SPEAKER_02]: they grow perpendicular to each other,
alternating perpendicular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like perfect alternating form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's straight up and back and forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the, the taste is more of a
fruitiness, um, you know, ripe fruit,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like a mango or, you know,
juicy fruit gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then there's, uh, the mango ties,
which I think are very in the same family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's another Highland
variety and those were a lot of the tie
[SPEAKER_02]: sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there's lemon ties, which are this
Highland ties and those could be purple or
[SPEAKER_02]: green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and those have like a lemon aroma or
high limonene aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and those are, there's lots of
different lemon ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, you know, it's, it's hard to say,
uh, there's the, um, grassy varieties,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are like some of the Highland
varieties are grassy and they're more
[SPEAKER_02]: jungly, uh, like the Chiang Mai.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's the chocolate ties,
which I think are mainly low land,
[SPEAKER_02]: low land varieties or purple, purple tie
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I'm, I'm trying to narrow down the
specific varieties that, that make up the
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolate ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some of the sixties were some of
the purple Highland ties or some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Lao varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, those were like some of the first
sixties chocolate ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think the later chocolate ties
were some of the, um, uh, lowland Lao or
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the other, uh, lowland ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they also had purple traits to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think those ones are musky,
euphoric coffee, tobacco tasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and there's also the red ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's ones that red, red pigments,
um, or like, um, brown and those ones
[SPEAKER_02]: have, uh, anthocyanins, the, the red
traits, the, the carotenoid traits that
[SPEAKER_02]: seem to turn them red, uh, red stem,
red, uh, flowers, um, which also turn into
[SPEAKER_02]: like a purple as well when dried,
um, kind of similar to like a Panama red.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those would kind of have, um,
what is very similar to all the,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the purple traits in those types of
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are kind of like the blackberry
port wine ish, grape ish, but not like a
[SPEAKER_02]: candy grape, more of like a, a Likord,
um, turpent profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but many of them have sweet tasting
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's hard to say, but there's so
many different ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I'm trying to get my hands around
a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we're going to be able to see all the
different differences, but there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's many different fruit flavor types,
um, as well as the sickly sweet types,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, highland, lowland.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then you have the stuff that are
more ganja varieties and more of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, and what they use for tie stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of the, um, indica types
that are like Thai indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, that's something you don't hear every
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're, they're, they're not in the
true form, like an indica, but they have
[SPEAKER_02]: the, you know, the hasher plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're thicker, um, larger,
you know, they look like hash plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're, they're ties, but they're
pure ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just, you know, tied derivative
indicas, if that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they, it would be nice to see what the
chemo type compositions are.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they have CBD in them or, um,
you know, if they're similar to you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexicans or other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is some of these lines
were imported from Mexico, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: during the, um, tie stick lines,
the guy named Brian Daniels was an
[SPEAKER_02]: importer of a lot of tie sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: His wife was married to, well,
he was married to a Thai woman and her
[SPEAKER_02]: family, her father was part of like the,
the head of police in Chiang Mai.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they, they got indigenous
tribal people to wrap the sticks and grow
[SPEAKER_02]: them on different, um, little pieces of
land.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they were able to transport the
sticks down to the water and avoid,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, police by, you know,
paying them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, basically this was done for like
20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they would import sticks into
Sausalito into like a San Francisco area,
[SPEAKER_02]: into Australia, into different places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so a lot of the stuff was brought in
from other countries like Mexico to speed
[SPEAKER_02]: up the, the, the gross rates of some of
the ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the hybridized ties that were
grown in Thailand and, and Cambodia and
[SPEAKER_02]: Laos were probably like Mexican seeds or
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the Colombian seeds were brought
to Columbia, um, and produced a line
[SPEAKER_02]: called sky blue blonde because some of the
tie lines were the tie varieties were
[SPEAKER_02]: shorter flowering than the long,
uh, you know, coming gold varieties,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, ties are extremely long,
but Columbus were even longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you can't grow a lot of Mexicans
in Columbia because they can't deal with
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the extended, um, you know,
um, daylight hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had to find varieties that would
grow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: What a detailed tie back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't expecting to get, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make me wonder how many other ties
there are out there that just sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get any mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, what people grew there,
there, you know, they, they'd call it one
[SPEAKER_02]: thing and then they, they rename it as
something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was Highland ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lowland ties, um, stuff that was purple
tie, maybe renamed here in the States is
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, lowland Laos could be renamed as
chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some of the mango ties could be sold
here as golden ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, some of the juicy fruit ties could
have been renamed as like golden ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some of the Buddhist sticks could have
been renamed as, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: from some of the lowland Laos or
Cambodians, uh, you know, it is resellers
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to make money off some of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know in 1988, I, we bought a chocolate
tie out of San Jose for, um, it was 80
[SPEAKER_02]: bucks for an eighth, which was a lot
because most eights were, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10, 15 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 80, 80 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite a bit or 75 bucks for an
eighth for chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the final fence move question we have,
which is actually a really good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they have asked, what is it that keeps
you up at night in relation to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the most concerning aspect of the
modern cannabis scene or culture in your
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the loss of, um, genetic germplasm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're losing so much of these old lines
because people are growing out gelato and
[SPEAKER_02]: these other fast flowering lines that are
kind of generic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and what they should be growing are
these varieties that will give them these
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome highs and these effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is no one's experienced
them because they didn't grow up in those
[SPEAKER_02]: ages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so it's genetic loss that I'm fearing
the most because there's so many varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: that we lose due to non-viable seeds due
to not getting the support to remake them
[SPEAKER_02]: or to make them available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's just genetic loss because there's
so much that is awesome about the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these things have evolved with
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis is, is, is, is unique and,
um, and varied as all the people in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have all the different spices and
tastes and colors and, um, experiences of
[SPEAKER_02]: all these different people and fruits and
vegetables that cannabis kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, holds in its, you know, its makeup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's like an experience,
but a human experience in a plant that you
[SPEAKER_02]: grow that you can smoke so you can,
you can ex these smoking experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all that's going to be lost,
all that history, um, unless we're able to
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve some of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I can't do it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and my friends can't do it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need help from the general public to
help, you know, make this something that
[SPEAKER_02]: people want to try because once you get to
try this stuff, you're going to want more
[SPEAKER_02]: of it because it's, it's, uh, beautiful
and happy and you don't get stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get, um, you unlock knowledge
that's not necessarily available to people
[SPEAKER_02]: unless they partake in something like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis allows you to use your mind,
uh, in a way like a person that's studying
[SPEAKER_02]: meditation for, you know, many,
many years, like a Yogi, somebody that's
[SPEAKER_02]: able to get their mind to a place where
they're able to perceive, um, things that
[SPEAKER_02]: most people can't because they're able to
get to that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, cannabis is a tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That allows you to get to that stage in a
much, much faster rate just by smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it allows you to free your minds from
the constraints of, um, what we think is
[SPEAKER_02]: moral or immoral and allows you to see
things for what they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, normal cannabis that people are
smoking doesn't do that, but some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties that are Thai or Mexican or
Vietnamese or Colombian, those can allow
[SPEAKER_02]: you to get to that those places and allow
you to access that knowledge that you
[SPEAKER_02]: normally wouldn't be able to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just hope more people will take the
time to either support the people that
[SPEAKER_02]: grow these varieties or help the people
that can make these available to more
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings us to our final quick five
questions for the interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first one being what is the single best
or most memorable experience in relation
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think the first time I smoked Panama
red, I was, uh, at my high school and I
[SPEAKER_02]: had smoked some Panama red and I thought
it was laced with LSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize at the time that you
can't smoke LSD, but I had had LSD before
[SPEAKER_02]: that and I knew the experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was so, uh, so high that my friends
had a carrying me, um, up to the school
[SPEAKER_02]: because, uh, it was just too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, from the experience that I thought I
was, uh, it had been laced with LSD and I
[SPEAKER_02]: thought I was going to be flying high for
a very long time because some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences from cannabis can be,
um, like a very strong psychedelic
[SPEAKER_02]: experience for a short period of time,
you know, a few hours or hour or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: it might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but that was a very memorable
experience that first Panama red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
what's a strain that all your friends
[SPEAKER_00]: were, you know, hyping up, telling you was
going to be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you finally had it,
you were like, Oh, is that it?
[SPEAKER_02]: G 13 G 13 was something that was always
kind of like hyped up for many,
[SPEAKER_02]: many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was this government strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I smoked it, it's, it's, it's potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's narcotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's generic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not so it's, it's great crossed other
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a shitty grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a small little hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing special, but it's hype to be
something special.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, hype works, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I was going to drop you off on a
desert Island and you can take three
[SPEAKER_00]: strains with you to grow for the rest of
time, what would you take with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, purple haze, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: This for lack of, you know, I think I'd be
happy with those three strains though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still want others, but yeah,
those are being very happy for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time, but I still want others.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that kind of covers a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say, uh, you're dropping someone
else off on the Island, someone you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: a big fan of.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to leave them with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some hemp, but you know,
I'm a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I probably let him have some like
Northern lights or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to numb the pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's totally cruel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so final question then, if I gave you
a time machine and you can go back
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere in history, any time where you're
going to go and what are you going to
[SPEAKER_00]: collect in presumably seeds or clients?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think the Zawastrian age,
uh, you know, when everybody was migrating
[SPEAKER_02]: to the bulk region, uh, worshiping
cannabis as Haoma, uh, they were bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: in cannabis from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, there's some Marians,
there's, um, Acadians, uh, there was all
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of different peoples there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and just Valley, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's Western age.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, um, like 13,000,
13, 1300, 1300 BC E and, uh, I think I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: be collecting a lot of different stuff at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it would be wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other place would be maybe the 1960s
in Columbia and Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some brilliant answers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love both of them get funky with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any comments or shout outs you
wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just like to say that, um,
I couldn't get here without my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, some newer, some older,
um, you can't do anything without your
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should always, um, you know,
thank the people that help you get where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you to my friends, uh,
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's it.
