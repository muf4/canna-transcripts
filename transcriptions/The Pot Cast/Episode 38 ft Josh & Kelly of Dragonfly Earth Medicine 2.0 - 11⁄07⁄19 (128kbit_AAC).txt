[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty, a big hello and welcome to
episode 38 of the podcast, a cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast for budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: As always, we want to give a big thank you
to our sponsors, Radio Ridge Nursery.
[SPEAKER_03]: These guys have all the primo cuts from
the best breeders, including the newest
[SPEAKER_03]: from FIC Farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these cuts clean as a whistle and save
you the time feno hunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they don't have every cut on
earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, if what you're looking for they
don't have, maybe you should head on over
[SPEAKER_03]: to Seeds here now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grab yourself a pack or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find that kippa fino for yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guarantee on satisfaction, not just
germination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit them both up, Radio Ridge Seeds here
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as always, a big shout out to 420
Australia and Organic Gardening Solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Abroskies from Down Under holding down the
fort.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shout out to the Patreon gang who
helped make the show happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And last but not least, big shout out to
our guests for this episode, the dynamic
[SPEAKER_03]: duo that use dragonfly earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're joined today by Josh and Kelly for
another wicked instalment of organic
[SPEAKER_03]: growing and health knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty, a big thank you and welcome to
two of my favourite humus beings for
[SPEAKER_03]: taking the time to join us again today for
the second time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Josh and Kelly of dragonfly earth
medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for sitting down and
chatting with us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really excited to be here with you
this evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right back at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first question I wanted to ask is
the normal first question, but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: the first question I asked you last time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's time to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: My first experience with cannabis was in
utero because my mother liked to smoke
[SPEAKER_07]: hash while she was pregnant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it just felt good to her.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she was an old hippie and of the area.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe she had some morning sickness or
some different things she was working out.
[SPEAKER_07]: But really, she was just a naturalist that
was living in southern Oregon and just
[SPEAKER_07]: wanted to, you know, be in nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was just part of her medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: So and so as I grew up, I was always
surrounded by and luckily it was I was in
[SPEAKER_07]: southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, that we saw the first,
you know, sticky kind buds, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: coming in and the Oregon big buds and the
purple cushions.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and I was just lucky enough to always
be around it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really never had to smoke, you know,
the Mexican brick and different stuff that
[SPEAKER_07]: people had to smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as I grew up, I just always had good,
good cannabis around us.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, that that started my love.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I and I never did any other hard drugs
or any other things in life because that
[SPEAKER_07]: was just a good print for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that that was my introduction.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then me and Kelly met when I was,
you know, just 19.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a long time ago now,
26 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're we're we've had a journey in
life since then as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, that's something we've
already talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first experience ever was I wasn't
like Josh at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And super conservative, you know,
very yeah, East Coast conservative family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never really saw it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I never had grown up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went out skiing in Wyoming when
I was probably about 14 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a bunch of skier hot shots were up on
top of the mountain and everybody was
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting up joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, hey, I think I'll take a
hit of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were at the very top of the
mountain and a huge snowstorm came
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a total whiteout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was stoned for the very first time
in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like, wow, I could see through the
whiteout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm the best skier in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like Josh, I never really went into
every happy drugs or got in really to any
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, maybe alcohol for a very,
very short time in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis has been a part of my life
ever since that day.
[SPEAKER_03]: How important do you feel it is to try to
have like a really positive first
[SPEAKER_03]: experience?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how much do you think it affects
people going forward in terms of whether
[SPEAKER_03]: they're willing to try it again,
whether they enjoy it overall?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's definitely, you know,
that first time is a really important
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of like it's important,
I think, to have a really good experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now more and more people are able to
have good experiences, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: because people have an understanding of
the different values of oil or hash or
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even the youth have sort of an
understanding and it's at the fingertip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can go onto the Internet and
you can learn so much about different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and what they might do to you
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, you know, for us at the very
beginning, I know for a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are my age, Mexican brickweed was was
pretty much like the first experience that
[SPEAKER_00]: they had, because that was what was
available, you know, in the late 70s and
[SPEAKER_00]: into the early 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people didn't
necessarily have a very good experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, maybe because of the way that it
was cultivated or maybe because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was actually really
incredibly strong, whether the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids show that it was super high
THC or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seemed like those flowers that
were coming from Mexico at that time are
[SPEAKER_00]: really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people were having not necessarily a
great experience, you know, just with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a lot of ways that cannabis is
given out nowadays, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, one could have a first
experience in so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be Phoenix tears.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be metabolic.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be cannabinoids.
It could be cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, there's why.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would take it maybe even one step
further and just say, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: from a biological standpoint, we have,
you know, more receptors in our body,
[SPEAKER_07]: CB1 receptors in our body than any other
receptors.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we may or may not be, you know,
having a complete endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, some people may have taken
pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe some people have antibiotics,
whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they haven't been close to nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so maybe their first experience was
like, wow, you know, a neurological,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, completion was almost shock to
their system.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that could be, you know, something
that that would really affect your first
[SPEAKER_07]: experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it could be overwhelming, you know,
at times.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that once you start,
you know, finding the right dosage or
[SPEAKER_07]: finding the right medicine that works for
you, you know, you do start completing
[SPEAKER_07]: your endocannabinoid system, which then
allows you to heal in ways that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, is adaptogenic and your immune
system can decide what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, first responses could mean a
lot of things based off, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: your... And I think when your
endocannabinoid system is really flooded,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're definitely going to have a much
better, you know, experience mentally and
[SPEAKER_00]: emotionally as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that it's really I always tell
people if you didn't have a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: experience the first time, it's probably
because you know, your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: system is a lot like a dry sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a while for the cannabinoids to
sort of be uptaken by the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once that happens, I think the chances
of having a good experience are way
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some people don't even get high on
their first smoke.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's like you hear a lot of
people, oh, I didn't feel anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then two, three times later,
and then by the third time, you're like,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, yeah, I got it, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's really interesting,
too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that just speaks to the
molecular biology and the natural medicine
[SPEAKER_07]: that it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some really, really interesting points you
raised there.
[SPEAKER_03]: One I just want to touch back on quickly
is how I think, Kelly, you mentioned how,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, some of these Mexican strains
had such potency to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people speak about this idea of
how some of the strains people think back
[SPEAKER_03]: on when they first started smoking,
and they'll talk about them as if they're
[SPEAKER_03]: just so much stronger than the stuff
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the counterpoint is raised that,
well, because good weed was kind of so
[SPEAKER_03]: sparse and it was just near and far in
between where you'd get it, it emphasized
[SPEAKER_03]: that, and it maybe makes people feel like
things were more potent than they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel that's the case, or do you
feel that there truly was this very unique
[SPEAKER_03]: profile back then, which really did make
things just kind of blow your socks off?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, you always hear,
oh, people bred out the CBD, and they just
[SPEAKER_07]: only bred for the high, and they only bred
for THC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which means that at one point,
there was none of that happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the early 70s and the late 60s.
[SPEAKER_07]: So at that time, you would think there
would be potentially a more complete or
[SPEAKER_07]: wide range of cannabinoids at the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think, you know, people talk
about, oh, I smoke a whole lid,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, was the term back in the day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, and it wouldn't get you
totally ripped, but it would just be like
[SPEAKER_07]: a beautiful high.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it was like the flower
power and the beautiful things of the 60s
[SPEAKER_07]: and 70s back to the land.
[SPEAKER_07]: All that was really done like on that kind
of herb and in that kind of medicated
[SPEAKER_07]: state.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I also know that, you know,
I think it's kind of known that the
[SPEAKER_07]: Colombian gold was really strong,
you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Acapulco gold was, you know,
really strong too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Oaxacan, some of the Oaxacan
strains were known to be really strong.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think that I've seen
cannabinoid reports from back in those
[SPEAKER_07]: days.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's my gut feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think my take on that would be that
the terpene ratios are, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: really important when we talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, in the
interbreeding that we've done,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all the way to this point now
from, you know, back in the late 60s,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really breeding for different types
of terpene ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we keep seeing the mercine,
you know, going up and up, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of terpene profiles are starting
to be bred out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when you have a really full,
rich terpene profile, then you have more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a chance of like getting sort of that
psychedelic feeling, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you have full cannabinoid,
full terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and I've even seen that now in
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, you know, that one really
sort of felt a little bit trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt a little hallucinogenic with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's what people are talking
about, because I can think about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, my first joints, it was all the
Mexican brickweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was actually going into,
I was at school in Arizona for a short
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that's the way I made my way
through college was sort of swinging that
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely feel like that flower did
create a hallucinogenic effect every time
[SPEAKER_00]: that you smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could say the same thing about the
original purple tie stick that people used
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a hold of, or just the tie stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another one that really sort of
created like that hallucinogenic feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's what people are talking
about when they talk about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they weren't getting necessarily
really high, but they were feeling sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: that hallucinogenic psycho, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the terpenes, you know, they do play
on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you traveled to Mexico back,
you know, throughout your life,
[SPEAKER_07]: you may have seen better Mexican weed,
you know, than when it got bricked.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it is true.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it affects the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, you'd lose a lot of
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is sad.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was paraquat was a really big part
of, you know, growing in the Mexican weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when my dad was dying of cancer,
he had a medical intuitive that was saying
[SPEAKER_07]: that the paraquat that was in the Mexican
brick weed that the governmental agents
[SPEAKER_07]: just sprayed from the air from helicopters
was, you know, was really in that herb
[SPEAKER_07]: right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's that who knows what others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could have maybe made you feel
more high or psychedelic too, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was being added to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, those are some thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, really interesting ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it raises my next point, which is,
where do you think we're going to go with
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes next?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I ask this is because I
feel like, you know, to kind of lend from
[SPEAKER_03]: the school of thought of Bodhi that
terpenes are almost like a gateway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis these days is almost like a
gateway drug to like wanting to discover
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes more, you know, like I feel like
it's only kind of natural or intuitive to
[SPEAKER_03]: want to get more into like kind of
perfumes and alchemy and just generally
[SPEAKER_03]: exploring it more, because something I've
noticed is like when I've got some incense
[SPEAKER_03]: burning or I've maybe smelled some oud
recently, if ever I smoke, I seem to get
[SPEAKER_03]: way more high, even though the terpenes
aren't necessarily from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where do you think we go next with
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I like that we have the ability to
explore different strains and there's a
[SPEAKER_07]: market for it and there's consumer
interest in it and there's more education
[SPEAKER_07]: on terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you really just start analyzing
strains simply from the standpoint of is
[SPEAKER_07]: it high in Mersene or high in THC or not,
it's amazing how many strains are high in
[SPEAKER_07]: Mersene.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's been said, you know,
many times.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you get into high, you know,
beta-osmine or terpenaline or,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, different strains like that,
it's part of getting high.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just like food, you know,
you're letting down saliva or different
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds in your mouth as you smell
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's like a pre-digester to your
food.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like kind of a pre-high to smell
the weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's why you want terpene,
you know, ratios in your lab test to be,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, 3% to 6%, you know, maybe 7%
would be amazing because that's part of
[SPEAKER_07]: the high.
[SPEAKER_07]: So terpenes, you know, there's food
terpenes, there's, if you're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: extract terpenes and add terpenes to food
and use essences, you know, that's a
[SPEAKER_07]: really big open market.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's countries that won't allow
cannabis-derived terpenes and there's ones
[SPEAKER_07]: that will.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's also people in the cannabis
industry that use food-grade terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And did you want to talk about that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the food-grade terpenes are,
you know, not necessarily made to the same
[SPEAKER_07]: standards or the same purity that can
happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, ganja terpene may be made.
[SPEAKER_07]: So having cannabis-derived terpenes is,
you know, a really, really good thing for
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine and for being able to use it in
food and different drinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I see in the industry right now,
which is what Josh just touched on,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the more that we abuse this plant
and the more that we continue to grow her
[SPEAKER_00]: in a synthetic environment, and the more
that we disregard ecology and disregard
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment and microbiology,
the more that the plant is going to react.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an adaptogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: She adapts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's going to adapt to whatever
environment that you put her in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we notice is that you can take a
full-spectrum cannabinoid plant with
[SPEAKER_00]: full-spectrum terpenes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put it in an environment where
she's not being, you know, taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not being regarded in a very high manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's going to happen is that all of
the terpene ratios go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC rises and the mercine rises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, that tells me that those are
both stressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are stressors within the plant that
that's what she does when she starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can maybe even take that plant
that's super high mercine and really high
[SPEAKER_00]: THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put it into a deep soil,
beautiful living bed outdoors under the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun, and then you'll really see start to
understand what the full genetic is of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that the way that we are
growing now and the way that we're trading
[SPEAKER_00]: these genetics that we think are just the
bomb and the fire, you know, is very
[SPEAKER_00]: respectful to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like she's reacting by,
you know, lowering her terpene and hiring
[SPEAKER_00]: her THC counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the future of the
medicine is nootropic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and also, you know, full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really important to have
nutraceutical over the pharmaceuticals to
[SPEAKER_00]: where the plant is being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that when people are being
given a choice on what they want to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: or what they want to ingest, if they have
a choice between a plant that hasn't been
[SPEAKER_00]: very respected and is put into these heavy
synthetic environments with high mercine
[SPEAKER_00]: and high THC, as opposed to something that
has been totally respected and is able to
[SPEAKER_00]: show its full value in its genetics,
they're going to choose that full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really hoping that in the future,
more and more people have an ability to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to experience the two different
varietals and be able to experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like to think that that's
going to be the future of the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: with terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the reason why the terpenes,
you know, are better or last longer with
[SPEAKER_07]: living soils is because they have the
fungal filaments in the roots eating the
[SPEAKER_07]: microbiology and really adding the right
waxes and the right terpenes and the right
[SPEAKER_07]: gases within the trichomes for the cure to
last right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if it's grown synthetically or,
you know, hydroponically, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: necessarily have the same body of flavor,
you know, in the long run.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it may not last longer than two weeks
and still be fresh.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when a plant is grown, when we say
respectfully, we say, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: in a living soil that's really active,
and adding metabolites to the soils and to
[SPEAKER_07]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the reason why it's better is because
it has a complete system that it's working
[SPEAKER_07]: with, which allows it to complete its
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that a good way for people to
understand it is I just believe like that
[SPEAKER_00]: high THC, high mercine is really the
cortisol of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the plant showing its stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you have a plant that has
full terpene and full cannabinoid ratios,
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant is just really full of
serotonin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It like has all of the happy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that you really feel that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're ingesting a plant
that's happy, you're going to have a way
[SPEAKER_00]: higher chance of having a better
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, so many points we need to touch
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, the first one which comes to
mind is when you reference kind of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, growing the plant respectfully
and how that means in a really nice,
[SPEAKER_03]: well-catered organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it raises the idea of is it
possible because I'm not sure myself,
[SPEAKER_03]: is it possible to grow quote, organically
in a cocoa medium?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, then you just start
getting into terms, you know, so I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, it's possible to have probably like
for the USDA, which is you'd have to check
[SPEAKER_07]: your country, you know, but I'm sure that
you could just use organic products that
[SPEAKER_07]: are certified and say, yeah, it's organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: But from our standpoint, you know,
the organic has been hijacked in that from
[SPEAKER_07]: that perspective.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why regenerative makes a lot of
sense to us because to say the word
[SPEAKER_07]: regenerative really means you're
regenerating life, which means you have
[SPEAKER_07]: living soils.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so those soils are aiding in the
medicine and that makes the medicine
[SPEAKER_07]: better.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, to have a more diverse soil,
is going to be more regenerative and from
[SPEAKER_07]: our perspective, more natural and better
than organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're really addressing the
endophytic reaction, which is within the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, which is something that we're just
absolutely, you know, fascinated with
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm incredibly fascinated with the
human microbiome as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take a plant and you're growing
it in cocoa and you're giving it organic
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments like what Josh says,
sure, you can say that it's grown
[SPEAKER_00]: organically, but was it grown naturally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it grown in a biological way?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer would be no, because you're not
really creating any biology in your coco
[SPEAKER_00]: coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no living food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, you know, microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really doesn't allow the plant to
reach its full potential because a full
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of a plant is when you have
maximum endophytes within it and it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: working within the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the way up to the leaves,
it's a complete cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And microbiology, you know, it's like,
well, you can say that you could be on an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic diet too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you, you know, are getting fed
through an IV tube or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can say, well, you could put organic,
you know, nutrients into the IV and the
[SPEAKER_00]: person can stay alive and you can say,
well, they have an organic diet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're completely passing the
microbiome, which is the digestive system,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the same as when you're,
you're taking away that living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: attribute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that person who's, you know,
living on this organic IV diet going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have the same, you know, full immune
stimulus response as the person who's
[SPEAKER_00]: using their digestive tract in a full
living microbiome?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the answer is no, it's really no
different for a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me of like a use it or lose it
attitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it raises a very interesting point
around classifications and certifications.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've long been very skeptical of the OMRI
certification.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure a lot of people are as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, it takes, you know, no less than
five seconds to find a product that's
[SPEAKER_03]: clearly not organic that has an organic
certification on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it raises the question, do we just look
to avoid it and just go based off things,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, for sure are organic because you
often hear people say, oh, I don't use
[SPEAKER_03]: anything from a bot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, there are some
products I use that come from a bottle
[SPEAKER_03]: that I know are full well organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you kind of navigate this
minefield as it may be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you touched on something really
important, which is OMRI.
[SPEAKER_00]: OMRI is a registration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not an organic certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go onto OMRI's website,
that's the first thing that they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a registry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the language is really powerful and
important because OMRI will state that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is, you know, able to be used in an
organic, for use in organic, for use in
[SPEAKER_00]: organic agriculture, but it's still up to
the third party certifier on whether
[SPEAKER_00]: that's organic or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, it's only a registry created
within that system that says, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: if you didn't have a product available
when, when in need, you know, that you had
[SPEAKER_07]: the ability to use a chemical here and
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, and so we, you know, and this is
not just a philosophy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we, we have over the years been very,
since we have products, as you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, so we've had all of our products
tested.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're testing raw materials for 12
years now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and we, you know, we're really aware
of, of what's where there's glyphosate,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and the glyphosate is just one
compound.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there could be Dacamba or just,
there's a thousand other compounds,
[SPEAKER_07]: but that are defoliants and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so, but we're careful about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, do you look for a
certification?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, I think at this point,
it's just a matter of education.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if someone says they're
biodynamic, you know, that may or may not
[SPEAKER_07]: be to the USDA standards or it may,
but you would probably feel pretty good
[SPEAKER_07]: about it because, you know, the biodynamic
standards are strong and people are really
[SPEAKER_07]: of the earth that are doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're making the world a better
place.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, other, other organic products or
organic standards that are based solely on
[SPEAKER_07]: products.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can have an organic product in a
bottle, but it, if it's, it still has to
[SPEAKER_07]: have a stabilizer in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And usually that stabilizer is a small
percentage of non-organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, from our certification,
we really recommend against anything in
[SPEAKER_07]: bottles and go with raw materials because
that's just the closest thing that you can
[SPEAKER_07]: get to something that's natural,
which is going to feed your microbiology.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're getting something in a bottle,
if it's not like expanding and blowing up
[SPEAKER_07]: in the bottle, then it's not alive really.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's in a liquid, it's being
stabilized.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not saying it's not useful because
obviously people are using things in
[SPEAKER_07]: bottles and growing plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, it's not that it's just,
if you want to regenerate life on earth,
[SPEAKER_07]: you have to go, you know, beyond,
beyond the bottle.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's, you know, we have our
certification and we've gone beyond just
[SPEAKER_07]: certifying products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like our, our certification is not,
okay, give me a list of products,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and let's go through this,
this process of deciding whether there's
[SPEAKER_07]: heavy metals in them or, or maybe,
you know, something like pyrethreins or
[SPEAKER_07]: something that's going to fail a test.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we do is we say, okay,
well, let's try and grow it naturally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try and enhance our natural biome
and our natural plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So certifications can mean a lot of things
and, and, and it really is a it takes
[SPEAKER_07]: education to learn what each certification
is about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So would your rule of thumb in general be,
you know, if, if you want to something
[SPEAKER_03]: from a bottle, so to speak, just make it
yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's what we suggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think also, you know, we,
we created the certification and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: actually even had people say, well,
it's so romantic, you know, it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: something that people could only strive
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe not, or only dream of and not
really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we created the
standards that we created, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing as many closed loops as you can,
whether you're an indoor gardener,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you have a tiny little small plot
in your backyard, there's still so many
[SPEAKER_00]: easy things that you can do to become
closed loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't because it just is sort of
this romantic idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're realizing is that the more
closed loop that you are, and the more
[SPEAKER_00]: vigilant that you are, about what is to
your plants, then you don't even have to
[SPEAKER_00]: sweat it when somebody buys your whole
stock and they turn it into a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we're seeing over and over
again, as people that are organic
[SPEAKER_00]: certified and they're following all the
organic, you know, certificate or all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic registering products out there
that they're still failing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And department of agriculture is like,
yeah, thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could totally do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's USDA or it's Canadian certified or
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the flowers are concentrated and they
fail heavy metals tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fail all different kinds of crazy
tests because they're, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrating it because it's becoming
concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever was in that flower,
what was ever in the soil or whatever was
[SPEAKER_00]: in your, your soil is medium is going up
into your flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: This idea of like, Oh, you can flush it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we always thought it was a joke
and now science is proving it to us that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it doesn't just flush out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes up into the plant and it stays
there for its duration and it stays there
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way until, you know, it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you turn it into a concentrate
and it becomes really apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's too many farmers out there
that have lost their entire crop because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's turned into a concentrate and they
fail a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like cannabis is giving us this
beautiful opportunity right now to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: our food sources, to look at big
agriculture, to look at the, at what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding our plants, to all of a sudden
have a look at the apples that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the store and wonder,
geez, you know, what's in this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now I know with cannabis testing,
it's just really leading the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it's not surprising because it's
a master plant and it's what she,
[SPEAKER_00]: she does.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gives us different ideologies and she
gives us, you know, different keys and
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions, you know, when we ingest her
and also when we cultivate her.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not just, you know, because we
don't believe in the system.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just when we, you know, we've learned
that 75 million tons of topsoil have been
[SPEAKER_07]: lost since the industrial revolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we know that, you know, there's a
million species on earth that are,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, potentially going extinct.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe the Great Barrier Reef is dying.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so what we're trying to say is,
you know, our, our certification is
[SPEAKER_07]: certifying farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: When we say that we're regenerative,
we know we're regenerating life on earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really meaningful to us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're, we're growing medicine that's
beyond just the term organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: The term organic at this point is just a
sort of a word that's just been,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, hollowed out by the system,
you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we're doing is we're,
you know, these, these closed systems are
[SPEAKER_07]: creating ingenuity on the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we can put carbon back into
the soil because agriculture, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: releases up to 12 gigatons of CO2 a year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's, there's so many reasons
why we have to do better.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we, we know the small farms have to
save the earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're creating small farm webs that are
saving the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: That brings us to a perfect next point,
which is that I've had a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: message me from both around Australia and
New Zealand and even some other distant
[SPEAKER_03]: parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of them ask questions along the
same line, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: how can I become a, a pure farm myself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not in a farm sense, but you know,
how can I try to get my little tent or my
[SPEAKER_03]: little, you know, backyard plot as closely
aligned with the dragonfly ethos as
[SPEAKER_03]: possible?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess it raises an interesting
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, will you guys be looking to
expand internationally with the
[SPEAKER_03]: certification?
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have, we, we already are
international.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the beauty of this is because
it's community run and community involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is creating sort of a
network.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as the web gets wider,
the weave gets tighter and we all have an
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding, you know, Josh and I go out
and we, and we do consultations or we,
[SPEAKER_00]: or we talk to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always say, you know, people like,
Whoa, that was so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so great what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always say, well, I didn't really
teach you anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just reminding you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that we have all of this great
knowledge deep within our DNA of what we
[SPEAKER_00]: know is right on the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people, you know, hear about what
we're doing, the certification,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many that want to jump on
because they're reminded of something that
[SPEAKER_00]: they know is a better solution than,
than what's happening now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter what size, you know,
plot you have, you can be pure certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we, we, we talk about having six
closed loops and the importance of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, so we're certifying all
different size farms from huge,
[SPEAKER_00]: massive hemp farms, you know, to,
to small backyard plots.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and, and there is a limitation on
massive, you know, hemp farms and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, when it talks, you need to
talk about 10 acres, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: regeneratively or 20, that's, that's
pretty big and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's, that's the way we're,
what we're thinking there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and so we have a, you know,
edel green farm out in Switzerland who are
[SPEAKER_07]: certified and there's three farms in
Canada that are certified and there's
[SPEAKER_07]: farms around the US.
[SPEAKER_07]: We went to Thailand and we're in
communication with farms with some,
[SPEAKER_07]: some local farmers in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we really do want to expand it into
the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we do travel quite a bit in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would love to visit an area to
really define what it is bioregionally,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, what pure certified would mean
or what, you know, regenerative would mean
[SPEAKER_07]: in a bioregion.
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now we're not certifying a lot
of indoor farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we have is mostly sun grown outdoor
farms and people with food gardens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the part of the requirements of
what we have is to have a food garden and
[SPEAKER_07]: to have pollinator and flower gardens
aside from your cannabis or even better
[SPEAKER_07]: mixed in with your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and it can be done indoors and we are
working on creating a pure certified
[SPEAKER_07]: indoor certification, which would,
and entail, you know, some type of
[SPEAKER_07]: alternative energy or some ways that
you've lowered your energy use and your
[SPEAKER_07]: grid using led lights or, or some kind of
a mixed spectrum.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, I, you know, we would just like to
tell people out in the world, please get
[SPEAKER_07]: in touch with us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, what we're interested in
is really earth stewards uniting and
[SPEAKER_07]: telling our story together.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to be just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: We, you know, food farms are out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're getting in touch with us to
wineries, anyone really, it's,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's kind of a way of life, you know,
and we, we support each other the best we
[SPEAKER_07]: can as family, you know, to, to just be
natural and, and make a difference.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and also we, we find ways we can work
together with business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not, it's not an exclusivity
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's absolutely earth stewards
unite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have these wonderful ideas and
there's a way that you can make a change
[SPEAKER_00]: within your own community or your own
neighborhood, you know, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something inspires you, then we're just
really encouraging people to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what happens, you know, part of the
peer certification that we do also is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to be part of community education
in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, go out and share,
share your successes, share your failures,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, talk about what worked and what
didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, we're at this wonderful like bell
curve of knowledge in the human race right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to find knowledge at a single
touch of the button and we're sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge in such an excited way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, the more that
we are able to align with nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: she has more and more solutions with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really, you know, the main
connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only are we connected by this master
plant, but we're also connected with our
[SPEAKER_00]: love of nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also I'll just, just add really
quickly that our, our, our best way of,
[SPEAKER_07]: of taking on new areas is to find a model
farm, say in Australia or New Zealand,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, a model farm that would have us,
you know, show up at the farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: We could have a gathering where we met,
you know, local farmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what we do is we, because our
certification is free, it's more about,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, being able to complete all of
the requirements.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and then once we visit, you know,
say that model farm, then we could create
[SPEAKER_07]: a peer reviewed inspection.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when, once one farm is, certified,
then they go out and certify other farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they can tell from that farm,
whether it reflects, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the level of standards and ethics that
they have.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the way that it builds within
each region.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we may come for the original one and
maybe we try and come back again later,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, on other years, but it becomes
peer reviewed and it, and it's,
[SPEAKER_07]: we take it really seriously.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all farms are having everything,
you know, every input on the farm is,
[SPEAKER_07]: is tested.
[SPEAKER_07]: And inspected to human grade quality and
art and all of our products are also,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, tested in laboratories.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we, we have to walk our talk
and, and create medicine that's,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, really valuable to the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the start of that one, you mentioned
that you had been looking at some stuff in
[SPEAKER_03]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed that you've been posting a
reasonable amount of content from Bali.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your involvement with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've been going to Bali for a really
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's see, I think maybe about 17,
17 years we've been going to Bali and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it started with me at the beginning is
that I was, um, Josh and I were both
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumental in opening up a free clinic
for women and, and in a birthing center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also for pregnant women, as well as
postnatal women to be able to come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: receive help, um, to receive care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was something that we started and
we just kept going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the tsunami happened,
um, uh, we were the first boots on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground in the Ache province.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, we worked with, uh, permaculture,
um, NGOs, EDEP was one, and Wal-He,
[SPEAKER_07]: which was friends of the earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we, we worked with other world NGOs
to, to come together to create,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, safe place for women and
children during, um, chaos.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we, we did a lot of work in that area
and also supported a clinic in Bali as
[SPEAKER_07]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of family.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's sort of another home for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another heart space for us in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we go there, we, you know,
we see a lot of family and friends and I
[SPEAKER_00]: get to be surrounded with a lot of older
children that I got to see, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's just a, it's a route for us.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we, we do custom sarongs and make
custom sarongs, but we, we also,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, that's a side thing,
but, um, we, um, work with permaculture.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we, we, we really like seeing
the expansion of permaculture that's
[SPEAKER_07]: happening on Bali.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a lot of international people
there and just a lot of really amazing
[SPEAKER_07]: food to table, uh, farm to table,
um, raw food places and farms that are
[SPEAKER_07]: really beautiful there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, it's been really fun to watch the
conscious expansion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being one of the countless Australians
who's been to Bali myself, I can attest
[SPEAKER_03]: that the, uh, the food there is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that it's grown locally and
organically only helps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the question I'm wondering is
what's the local production of cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: like there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because from my extremely, extremely
limited experience, it was, it was hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: find decent quality stuff, but that's very
much from the perspective of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, uh, someone who's not in the
loop with any of the locals or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's it like when you're a part of that
inner circle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in Bali, particularly, we wouldn't
recommend it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, it's a very Indonesia is
incredibly strict.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even though a lot of the, the older
Balinese, and especially when you go over
[SPEAKER_00]: to Sumatra, you know, you definitely see a
lot of the locals using cannabis and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of a normalcy for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some of, some of the most isolated
cannabis in the world, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I believe to still be, you know,
true land race is in Sumatra is in some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the islands in Indonesia because it's been
so blocked off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if you, if you go to Bali,
it's a really good time to take a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's not a time to ask people on the
streets, you know, where to find it or
[SPEAKER_00]: where to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, people are found with,
with five grams and they're spending 17
[SPEAKER_00]: years in jail as Australians.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that you want to be
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really the quality that you get is
going to be from another Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I would just really
recommend to people that that's just not a
[SPEAKER_00]: place where, where cannabis mixes with
their vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course you see a lot of these old
land races that I was just talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that I'm really
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I went and worked over in
Sumatra for many months, I learned a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about, um, the relationship that the
locals had there with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very tight, close relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that they use to calm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something that they used in their
daily life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when they would come into the clinic,
I would say, you know, how much do you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would say, well, I smoke,
you know, six of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would point to their breast
pocket that had the tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'd say, I'd smoke eight of these a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, the cannabis pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though there's, it's really
incredible sort of strict regimen,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and laws.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really interesting at Jay is a CEH,
which.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is like an acronym for Arabic,
Chinese, European, and Hindustani.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, it's, it's, it's, it's just
because see as, as, as that sound in
[SPEAKER_07]: Indonesia, but that the AJ region is a
Northern Sumatra.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's one of the most strict Islamic
areas in Indonesia, but it's where all the
[SPEAKER_07]: herb is grown.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's super kind of like, and they have
gorilla kind of, they had the,
[SPEAKER_07]: the, you know, different autonomous.
[SPEAKER_07]: Regions there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and they, they say that the weed came
from India back in the Dutch trading days
[SPEAKER_07]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I, you know, exactly how long it's been
on Sumatra, maybe hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't really know exactly cause it has
really closed off, but it is interesting
[SPEAKER_07]: how it's in common, you know, the common
person's possession in Northern Sumatra,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a real tall, thin leafed variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has, you know, uplifting terpenes,
uh, you know, more like a lemony and beta
[SPEAKER_00]: karyophylline terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they take incredibly long time to
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so they're really reminiscent of,
of just interesting cannabis that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is not something that,
and it definitely gives you a very
[SPEAKER_00]: different feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were talking earlier about,
oh, you know, those old land races and.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it make you feel like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, that really isolated,
very far removed and not interbred with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the modern cannabis, um,
of today really gives you a totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different eye than, than what the modern
cannabis does.
[SPEAKER_07]: We brought some seeds back.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we're trying to give it a
try to germinate them.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be a little difficult, but you know
what?
[SPEAKER_07]: We, we are always a little bit of a,
you know, crafty, let's say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things managed to just appear back at home
somehow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Malaysia's laws are changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're really hopeful that Indonesia's
laws change with that, with Thailand's
[SPEAKER_07]: change, the world, you know, is changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and I would love nothing more than to
be able to, to work with hemp or hemp oils
[SPEAKER_07]: in Indonesia, because there's crazy
sicknesses happening there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm in love with rice and what's
happened with rice is their staple diet is
[SPEAKER_07]: creating a lot of weird illnesses there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, they, they could have really
used the medicine and it would be nice to
[SPEAKER_07]: see some law changes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time that we went to Bali,
there was more and more people asking us
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how I was talking about earlier
of just being reminded that this is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and they would say, Oh,
well, my grandmother used that in tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's no like bad reflection,
you know, on cannabis or they haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: through like any kind of a political move.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just know that it's illegal,
but they don't really get why it's
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's in the village, but it's not
given out to the tourists.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a clear distinction and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's, that's what's happening
in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of backs my limited experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Admittedly I was what 14 when I went there
so many moons ago, but to jump onto
[SPEAKER_03]: something a little more recent,
it's been well over a year since we last
[SPEAKER_03]: talked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably should have asked this a little
earlier on, but what's new in the world of
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragonfly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, you know, one week in the
cannabis industry feels like a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so much that's happening right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we just wanted to be humble
cannabis farmers and producing beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine for sick people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now all of a sudden we're learning
about genetic coding and patenting and
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing and corporate takeovers and,
and creating a business and how you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, learn the rules so you know
how to break them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just, and federal licensure and
how to do it without a consultant and,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, still having our products and
still growing a whole new garden and every
[SPEAKER_07]: year, but mostly exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: The most exciting thing we think is just
the, the, the collective of farmers and
[SPEAKER_07]: businesses that we're working with and the
science of regenerative cannabis tour that
[SPEAKER_07]: we've been doing is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And just the expansion of knowledge of
organic and regenerative practices.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've recently formed an online
communication hub where we can all
[SPEAKER_07]: communicate with each other live.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really, really excellent because
there's, you know, you know, 75 people on
[SPEAKER_07]: there that are very, you know,
active and we all can communicate with
[SPEAKER_07]: each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just really, really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like as much of the heavy
feeling of licensure and the man coming
[SPEAKER_00]: down on you and heavy duty fines and all
that sort of stuff, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people having to close up their farms
because they can't make, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in economic struggles,
you know, as much as all of that is really
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult and that is happening is as
equal of what is fabulous and fantastic
[SPEAKER_00]: that's happening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we are so totally sparked on by
people, you know, this is a perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: example we, we got back from Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had been on a flight for, I don't even
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It felt like 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Josh and I hadn't slept.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent two hours in, in Vancouver and
like it's great in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were able to like smoke some bowls
right there in the airport, just right
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we flew onto Michigan and it was
dark and it was snowing and we had just
[SPEAKER_00]: come from Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, what in the heck are we doing
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is totally crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then not even five hours later,
we walked into a room of people at the
[SPEAKER_00]: conference of the science of regenerative
cannabis conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it only took one second to realize why
we do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as much as it seemed like,
Whoa, that was a really crazy journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the energy in that room of people
that just want to connect over this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and want to connect over nature and want
to connect over like learning about
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology and how to better their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how to get off their pharmaceuticals
because it's all in relation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we really have this
understanding that if you have healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, then you have healthy life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like all of that is happening
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this really beautiful yin and yang
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like they're equally as potent
and it's, and, and, and that's why I say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one week in the cannabis
industry is a year because so much is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening within that one week that,
you know, you really want to like hold
[SPEAKER_00]: onto it and soak it up because it's just
also potent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the farm bill passed and the hemp is,
you know, a really big frontier and
[SPEAKER_07]: feminization of seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, there's, there's a lot that
we've been, we've been talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that can spark, you know, more
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys brought up the science and
regenerative cannabis conferences.
[SPEAKER_03]: How has that been and what types of things
can we expect to see kind of springing
[SPEAKER_03]: forth as a result of those conferences?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what's really beautiful about the
conferences is that it is really rooted in
[SPEAKER_07]: science and it does go through and give
you really nuts and bolts information from
[SPEAKER_07]: really good presenters.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's almost been become like a
spiritual thing too, because I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: farmers have to band together right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, and not only is it exciting to create
a natural system and get, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: good product, it's also kind of a
beautiful networking opportunity for
[SPEAKER_07]: people to come together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we did it internationally
this year for the first time in Vancouver
[SPEAKER_07]: and farms are just becoming, you know,
they're just branding themselves here in
[SPEAKER_07]: Canada and British Columbia this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they haven't been able to, you know,
say, you know, I'm a farm until,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, now, so there's, it's now almost
new here, humble.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know was it was really, really amazing
and farmers are really, really coming
[SPEAKER_07]: together and showing up in numbers and
just really seed swapping and sharing
[SPEAKER_07]: seeds with each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really just an open public domain of
knowledge sharing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's not just a presentation,
you know, we're, we're staying in the
[SPEAKER_07]: parking lot in between, we're eating
together, we're staying around at night.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're really, really connecting
with the crowd and going to areas where
[SPEAKER_07]: they really haven't had conferences like
Maine and Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people, you know,
we're saying that, you know, I came here
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn about science of soil and
cannabis, and I left with 120 brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing friends that I know that I can
call within a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, what these are giving us is
inspiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's so many crazy things going on
in the world and you turn on your TV and
[SPEAKER_00]: if you get sucked into those doldrums of
whatever that is, it's like, we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: get out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to just look at each other in the
faces and talk about things that inspire
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so amazing to be in a room with
all of those people that are that inspired
[SPEAKER_00]: by nature that really want to make a
change in their own lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really, you know, recommend that,
you know, you asked earlier, what can
[SPEAKER_00]: people do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They really want to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we recommend is start with yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts with self love and it starts
with wanting to make changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within your own body and then that ripples
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have all of those wonderful
feelings about yourself and the health and
[SPEAKER_00]: well-being within your own body,
then it's really easy to educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to get the word out
because you're really walking,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your talk.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, there's like we said,
there's science presentations and then we
[SPEAKER_07]: will have our pure certified farmers
panels in the evening where you can do
[SPEAKER_07]: question and answer and it gives each farm
an opportunity to say what they do on
[SPEAKER_07]: their farm that, you know, maybe has taken
some of the practices that are being
[SPEAKER_07]: taught and shown people how they've put it
into action.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's really useful for people that are
attending the conference to hear,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, from five different farms that
are, you know, publicly, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: creating medicine and putting themselves
out there to say, hey, this is how I've
[SPEAKER_07]: taken these systems and put them into
action.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's been really useful.
[SPEAKER_07]: The question and answer and the genetics
talks and, you know, there's a lot with
[SPEAKER_07]: genetics right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's been a lot of talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bit of a left of field question,
but do you find that the people who attend
[SPEAKER_03]: these conventions or in general,
just people are part of, say, the pure
[SPEAKER_03]: family tend to gravitate towards certain
types of genetics or do you think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: rather a diverse spectrum?
[SPEAKER_07]: Diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's diverse, but there's
more and more topics of full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid profiles and full spectrum
terpene profiles and the importance of
[SPEAKER_00]: that in really bringing forth the medicine
so that, you know, we can hold a good
[SPEAKER_00]: voice for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to me like, you know,
more and more people are gravitating to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, the old strains are out
there and people are loving on that.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a good amount of us that are
keeping land race alive.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a good amount of us that are
really keeping hash strains and searching
[SPEAKER_07]: for the best hash strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this is a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hemp is a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a breeding project for hemp is really
a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I wouldn't say that everyone
loves, you know, gas or fruit or flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something for everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's what's awesome about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So part of strain selection for any farm
is considering the types of pests you have
[SPEAKER_03]: to deal with in your area or within your
grow environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember at the Emerald Cup last year,
I asked a question that was essentially
[SPEAKER_03]: around the lines of what happens to the
predator bug excretions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is that a problem in itself?
[SPEAKER_03]: And our colleague on the panel,
Ron, gave a fantastic answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also remember having a look over and
seeing this huge grin on Kelly's face when
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to know what's your opinion
on this?
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens to the bug poop?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's an incredible web of
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, if you're even somebody that
wants to order predators out there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, you already probably are not
spraying crap on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have, if you look under a
microscope, you would see a tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's cyanobacteria that's on the
leaf structure of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a really healthy plant,
you've got a huge diversity of different
[SPEAKER_00]: cyanobacteria, different types of fungi on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the times, if there is
predator poop, it is actually being
[SPEAKER_00]: digested by what's already on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the microbiology, it feeds the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the more natural excretions that
happen in the plant and the more that we
[SPEAKER_00]: mimic nature, which when you're mimicking
nature, you're going to have an incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of both microbiology and macro
biology on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you allow, you know, that nature
and that full, you know, potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, of of what is possible within
nature, then the plant is really absorbing
[SPEAKER_00]: that and it becomes an incredible nutrient
for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably why I was smiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking, you know, that's probably
just good food for the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And depending on what state you're in and
and what your your requirements are for
[SPEAKER_07]: passing tests, I mean, you know,
you have to be extremely careful nowadays
[SPEAKER_07]: with what happens with your flowers and
whatnot and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and there's there's pathogen tests and
aspergillus is, you know, things that have
[SPEAKER_07]: been brought up that may maybe have been
associated with predators and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's it's it's the system
that's been created to grow cannabis in is
[SPEAKER_07]: almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's amazing that people are
doing as well as as they're doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, like in life, you kind of
need to be able to to eat like microscopic
[SPEAKER_07]: insect poop or smoke it even.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that's what I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to survive, you know,
of course, an immune response within the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and within your own body as well,
which is just incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're suppressing our immune response with
all of these outside sources of just like
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilize, sterilize antibiotics,
kill the microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more that we learn, we're
realizing that microbiology is what's
[SPEAKER_00]: clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, worried about a little bit
of poop that's from a predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my it's definitely something to
look at if you're doing really strict
[SPEAKER_00]: regimen of testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as a home grower or somebody
that, you know, is is just making medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: for other people and for themselves and
sharing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, you know, you probably don't
want to get your predators really late in
[SPEAKER_00]: your flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a really good idea to allow
them to, you know, eat, eat all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens on there, you know, several
weeks before harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, I don't ask that as
though I feel like it's a major problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ask it because it's it's the commonly
used line which people who are whether
[SPEAKER_03]: overtly or kind of more subconsciously a
critical of predator bugs and maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: organics in general, that's what they use
to try to kind of discredit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's an interesting point,
but maybe not as valid as maybe other one
[SPEAKER_03]: they could come up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I digress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something we also spoke about last year,
though, was how big of an issue aphids
[SPEAKER_03]: were.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you guys advocate to combat it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's it's an ever changing
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your solution to aphids or just in
general bugs out there?
Doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poly culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a wonderful example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go into Williams into southern
Oregon and we have a whole lot of pure
[SPEAKER_00]: farms there and a lot of friends that have
farms in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely like a cannabis Mecca in
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go into Williams area,
you've seen, you know, cannabis farms
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much almost every single property.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the rare property that's not
growing cannabis and they got hit really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard with aphids this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids is absolutely the new pathogen that
everybody needs to prepare for and we know
[SPEAKER_00]: of one farm and that's Casey over rising
Phoenix Phoenix rising farms and he did an
[SPEAKER_00]: overabundance of pollinator like garden
like you wouldn't believe flowers just
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a gorgeous farm and he did flowers
everywhere and he didn't have one single
[SPEAKER_00]: aphid at all because wasps eat like triple
their weight in aphids in a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and same with, you know, all these
different types of bugs out there as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as bees and I mean and as well as birds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just a perfect example and maybe
you have a nursery in a greenhouse and you
[SPEAKER_07]: can do a heat treatment at 120 degrees for
50 degrees centigrade, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: two hours or whatnot and and maybe three
and you just monitor it and make sure the
[SPEAKER_07]: plants are doing good, but you can heat
treat a nursery pretty easily and that's a
[SPEAKER_07]: really clean easy way to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, you know a good spray with water
early on can can can get them.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, that's another thing and
some people have had success after heat
[SPEAKER_07]: treatments with with like a good swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had the best experience when when
when it first came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, whoa, this is not a normal aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what anybody says.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is we're not dealing with a normal
aphid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put it into jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fed it all these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was watching how many it was reproducing
or cloning itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was feeding it all different types of
foods, you know, even brassicas and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: running from the brassicas like what if it
runs from a brassica like even survive off
[SPEAKER_00]: of brassicas, you know, it's their number
one food source and this one was so
[SPEAKER_00]: different and it has like these little
hooks on its chest that other aphids don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew that we were like up against
something really interesting and the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that it was, you know, propagating itself
was like quadruple the rate at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're really watching this and I
think Josh and I, you know, we put this
[SPEAKER_00]: out on Instagram right away and many
several years ago and people were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those look like normal aphids,
you know, and what we noticed is I sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 25 different oils on it and all
different homemade things and things that
[SPEAKER_00]: I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we just came to what would
happen if we mess with the bacterium,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is inside of the aphid, which has to
be some kind of have some kind of a heat
[SPEAKER_00]: issue going on and that bacterium is what
helps it propagate and what clones itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you mess with that bacteria,
which is inside of the aphid, bringing the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature up high, then it sterilizes
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we realized that really soon on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started doing tests and how many
hours and how high did the temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: need to get and were they harming any of
our pollinators or was it harming some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other important, you know,
insects that we had within the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really came to that 120 degrees for
two to three hours and your pollinators
[SPEAKER_00]: just thrive in that heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants thrive in that heat as long as
they're damp and they're not in small
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot be heating up the roots to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plants really thrive in that and
the aphids are completely sterilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then within a very short period of
time, all of your insects that like to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: the aphids will come in within a couple of
days and just pick them off because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not propagating and recolonizing
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So heat treatment, I think above and
beyond any thing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also pollinators if they're outside
because they are in our natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came like an incredible vengeance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would venture to say that somebody made
them up as an evil plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I can't put my finger on
that by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just the way that it came into our
community and they weren't just being
[SPEAKER_00]: passed by clones because we don't use
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only started with seeds and all of a
sudden they were here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that pollinators if you're
outdoors and heat treatment for
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses and indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some really solid suggestions there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember that another major point that I
took away from that discussion was that
[SPEAKER_03]: the use of essential oils was potentially
a lot more problematic than people are
[SPEAKER_03]: aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you be able to go into a little more
depth for our audience who maybe haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: been able to hear that discussion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, for me, I don't I don't
really like to be covered in oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know about you,
but sort of that oily feeling all over
[SPEAKER_00]: your body is really no different than what
the plant feels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're spraying heavy oils or any
kind of volatile essential oils or even
[SPEAKER_00]: like a coconut oil, then that's going to
immediately change the microbiome on your
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you change the microbiome of your
leaf surface, then you're allowing in
[SPEAKER_00]: other problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always look at what you do to your
garden should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't look at the first ripple,
you know, like if you drop a stone into
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I've said this before,
but if you drop a stone into water,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not the first ripple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to look at the very last ripple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you spray your plants with essential
oils for pests, are you going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in more pathogenic leaf mildew,
you know, or what other factors or stress
[SPEAKER_00]: or the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, light sensitivity or what other
stressors are the plant going to have?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really not a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's definitely and it's and it's more
of an allopathic look at it rather than a
[SPEAKER_00]: real holistic look, which we really
encourage people to look at their gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: more holistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we can have a better understanding
of looking at our own health more
[SPEAKER_00]: holistically, because cannabis has an
incredible lesson to teach us all,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, you know, what she thrives best
in is what we also thrive best in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you think of the Emerald Cup in
general?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a little discussion about our
talks thus far, but the overall consensus
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had from a variety of guests on the
show is that the kind of overall vibe and
[SPEAKER_03]: more specifically the energy that's
normally in the air just wasn't quite
[SPEAKER_03]: there last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about that one?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, first of all, we really,
really love the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we didn't know that was
going on because we were in our teepee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome in our teepees.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, in all fairness,
I guess it's the laws that have changed,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, so the laws in California have
dictated the way the event can run.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, it's not like, you know,
Tim and Taylor came out and said,
[SPEAKER_07]: oh, you know, we're going to or hazel,
whatever, we're going to we're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: run this, you know, like this,
you know, you know, they're they're trying
[SPEAKER_07]: to do the most heartfelt, amazing,
you know, show that they can do,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, with the laws that they've been
given.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and if you want to get get upset at
some get, you know, get upset at the state
[SPEAKER_07]: of California and the way that they've
created, you know, distribution,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, for farmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so because now, you know, you're not
going to get as many farmers as you did
[SPEAKER_07]: before, because they're probably through
some kind of distribution company.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe the distribution company is
awesome or maybe they're not.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, the tents were different
than they were before.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you could, you know, to get directly
to a farmer was different.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there was as many panels as there
always was.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, for us, the Emerald Cup is
a really great experience because we have
[SPEAKER_07]: two teepees and we have our cocoa going
and we have all of the farmers that we're
[SPEAKER_07]: working with around the whole time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're we're giving, you know,
we have seed exchange happening and you
[SPEAKER_07]: know, we're able to, you know,
consume and just really enjoy each other
[SPEAKER_07]: and really talk a lot of stories.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, we we have like, you know,
epic times at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and I would say, you know,
times have changed and that that's what's
[SPEAKER_07]: hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the Emerald Cup, it's still a
gathering of, you know, some of the most
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing farmers in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's really not another event
that's, you know, better than it at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, we're really stoked
about what they've done and we're proud to
[SPEAKER_07]: be part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can feel, you know, where those
people are coming from, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, Josh really hit the
nail on the head is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What people are feeling is the new
regulations, what people are feeling is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not that same direct voice from
the farmer, not the same type of
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're feeling that, you know,
three years ago, a tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: farms that were there are no longer in
business because they couldn't stay in
[SPEAKER_00]: business because the exorbitant licensing
fees or timing or, you know, people who
[SPEAKER_00]: have applied for licenses and it's just
sitting in an office, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The incredible regulations that farmers
and breeders and extractors and product
[SPEAKER_00]: makers are under is is is so significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it absolutely doesn't surprise me
that people felt that energy at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the general consensus we have
within the community in the moment is that
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a lot of elements of disunity and
I guess distrust more specifically for the
[SPEAKER_03]: way legal changes and the way bigger
companies are acting on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you see us going forward?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's the best way to kind of get
everyone on the same page in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: morals and ethics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Drop the competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not in competition with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: These outside big entities are coming in
and they're instilling a fear within
[SPEAKER_00]: people that they need to be competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not in competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are the opposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not in opposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are just an alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to join together and be really
happy for other farmers successes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be happy for, you know,
passing out your genetics and somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else did a better job than what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's freaking rad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be happy for each other because
this sort of like fear-based competitive
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is coming into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think that if we can drop
that, that's just the answer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And realize, you know, that we are really
a commodity and that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: the large corporations are wanting to
capitalize on our intentions and on our
[SPEAKER_07]: ethics.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if farmers are not mindful,
they could potentially join forces with,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, corporations.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then in the end, the corporation just
acts like a corporation does and they just
[SPEAKER_07]: sell, potentially sell you off or sell off
your whole, your, your face or what you've
[SPEAKER_07]: created, your marketing, what all that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, so, you know, this is a time
where we're just trying to say,
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, you know what, let's just not be
exclusive with anyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: One person, let's just keep your autonomy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's create independence and autonomy and
autonomy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's create products.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they're together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they're within each farm and create
a network.
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now it's just don't get eaten by
a corporation.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's basically the monitor.
[SPEAKER_07]: You wake up in the morning and you're
like, okay, how am I not going to get
[SPEAKER_07]: eaten by a corporation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't think that, you know,
you've got one contract that's in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: you, that that's going to be the last one
that you're ever going to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really want to see more pro tracks
rather than contracts.
[SPEAKER_07]: Contrary to your well being, you know,
independence and realizing that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: work together with other farms and say,
Hey, you know, what's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys got going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more that you share and we talk to
each other, then we're creating a much
[SPEAKER_00]: larger commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Josh said, I mean, we are the
commodity for the first time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this year, we, we started realizing how
many thousands and thousands of pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: that the pure collective already produces
per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas these huge corporations are just
talking about, you know, what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do in 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are already doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way that these corporations are
going to get the keys to our castle is if
[SPEAKER_00]: we give them to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep the keys to your castle,
share them with your friends who are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be respectful and ethical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same way that you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys put out your perspective on
the whole file of debacle a few weeks
[SPEAKER_03]: back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, it was, you know, beautiful
kind of statement of authenticity and kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of re-integrating what we need to do to
move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there wasn't a lot of views expressed
on specifically how you see the file of
[SPEAKER_03]: situation and what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like we're at a point now
where it's almost very problematic to
[SPEAKER_03]: incorporate any sort of genomic testing
within our kind of garden or our
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, you know, for sure,
we weren't totally against what happened
[SPEAKER_07]: with Phyllis and what happened there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that would just seem like
something that, you know, it really
[SPEAKER_07]: brought up the conversation as farmers,
where do we stand?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, how do we work together?
[SPEAKER_07]: And we look to like our food systems and
we look and we're looking to what's
[SPEAKER_07]: happened with like food.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, this this has happened
before.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we're looking into open
public domain and and breeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I do genomic sequencing
comes from, you know, large corporate
[SPEAKER_07]: machines.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, you'd have to be really
skeptical to use that information.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that someone else isn't going to
use it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they have better technology to use
it than you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, personally, I just want to give a
big shout out and a thank you to Phyllis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an incredible opportunity that we
were all given to look at the dark side
[SPEAKER_00]: and to realize we better get our shit
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to start creating this
powerful entity, you know, within
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how is it that we can pull together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And since that time has happened,
I mean, the education that Josh and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: searched out, you know, we've gone to
mentors, we've been talking to people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are way smarter than we are and who have
had way more experience than we have on
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do they feel about, you know,
public domain and open source and and
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing and patenting and what I keep
coming to as far as the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's an adaptogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool patent away because great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to patent a seed and then I'm
going to take that seed and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: put it into my deep red, rich,
beautiful garden beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to look like your seed
that you just patented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we need to give credit to
the cannabis plant as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is not just soybean.
[SPEAKER_00]: She isn't tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: She isn't corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's not going to be that easily
controlled, you know, in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we need to focus more on
being the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the best genetic that we're going
to put out this year so you can go ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can you can patent your your 2017
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's talk about what we do in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be pushing ourselves to be
better and to create better strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: not be looking at the past of what was
because she's constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, when you say open source
and and you know, genetics, that's exactly
[SPEAKER_07]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you put every all of your
information out in the public,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know that anyone can use it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'd have to be, you know,
really skeptical or or decide whether you
[SPEAKER_07]: care or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because maybe at one point you're
just like, well, you know, I'm in
[SPEAKER_07]: evolution right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Kelly said, you know, what I'm in the
middle of right now is making something
[SPEAKER_07]: new and making something new.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, none of us really necessarily keep
the exact same strain forever.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if and if ganja could have been could
have been patented and controlled,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they would have done it back in
the 30s when they got rid of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that they could chemically fertilize
cotton and other wheat and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I think that the cannabis plant
would have been genetically modified then
[SPEAKER_07]: and controlled then.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't think it actually can.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think maybe on one level,
we may not actually have to worry,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, about about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we are also not joining that and don't
condone that at all either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I and I don't feel really bad that
people are spending millions and millions
[SPEAKER_00]: of dollars to try to figure out how to
patent and marker this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, go ahead, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I'm really having all of my bets that
the cannabis plant will have the last
[SPEAKER_00]: laugh and we'll just take all of their
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's that's sort of what
we go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also the Spilos thing has given us
now, you know, like I was saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: we we went to Corvallis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sat down with Alan Capular for many
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any of you who don't know who Alan
Capular is, a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mushroom, please go online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an incredibly intelligent geneticist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He understands what marketing and and
genetically modifying is because he did
[SPEAKER_00]: that in his earlier years of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and what we came to is, you know,
since all of that has happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: we are now which we were already planning
on doing, but it's with much more
[SPEAKER_00]: intention is we're doing a pure certified
breeding project right now so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: get seeds from a particular farmer and we
can pass it out to 50 different farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take a little bit of data between
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is public domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seed, that varietal becomes
actualized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important because there
is 40 other farms that have done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really say bring it into the public
domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to, you know, have a seed or a
varietal that is yours that you would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep as yours, you're going to have to
give it out to a whole lot of people so
[SPEAKER_00]: that that becomes actualized so that
nobody else can take that from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we feel like that's much more powerful
than paying a whole bunch of money to
[SPEAKER_00]: patent something that can be changed
anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you feel about genomic testing
in general?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like it's almost inevitable
that ultimately the data set will be sold
[SPEAKER_03]: off or do you feel like there is a way to
get this information while feeling safe
[SPEAKER_03]: about the results and it not falling into
the hands of say Big Ag?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, guaranteed it's going to be sold
off.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to think that you're joining something
and it's not going to be sold off is just,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's just not true.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's already been sold off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everywhere is but with food and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that human beings sell out
corporations are meant to sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like being angry with a cougar that
kills a bunny rabbit, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's the nature of big corporations,
big corporations are going to come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way that we can prevent that
is by joining forces with each other.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I was saying before, so maybe you use
it and you, and you, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: take what you want out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you've, you've created a protract
that works for you with your, with your,
[SPEAKER_07]: with genomic sequencing company.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are companies out there that might
anonymize your information and you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: you, you might find a company that you,
you can trust, you know, for us,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and there's universities,
you know, that you might trust to,
[SPEAKER_07]: to, to work with, but you know,
to think that Big Ag is not, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what, it's what Big Ag is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what Big Ag does, you know,
it's what they do with genetics and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think our, our value, I think we should
just not worry about it and just make our
[SPEAKER_07]: value the way that we grow and the,
the diversity of genetics rather than
[SPEAKER_07]: worrying about one strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings up sort of this, this term
ownership into the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the ownership of a certain strain
that you've been working with 10 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the human beings were working with it
10,000 years before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, what's ownership?
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what is it that we own?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, we feel like, oh geez,
well, we have to own it before they own
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, is,
is sort of this, this fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it's sort of that,
that the competition thing that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about, like, why is it that humans
feel like we need to own something,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially a seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can't even believe that that's
legal, but of course I can because legal
[SPEAKER_00]: is based in corporations and corporations
are here to crush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love what the Dalai Lama says,
learn the rules so you know how to break
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can look at the incredible failures
that genomic sequencing and GMOs and even
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridization has given us like,
oh yay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have 17 different varieties of
2000 different potatoes that we could be
[SPEAKER_00]: eating on the planet, but there's only 17
like, I'm just making up those numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like we're, is there something
about humans that likes to set up a system
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can't even work within?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that if we just sort of take a
step back and realize what wasn't working
[SPEAKER_00]: within genomic sequencing is we'll realize
like, why do we want to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What it, it just doesn't make any sense
because then it starts to have ownership.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said before, I, I love my
varietals and Josh and I work really hard
[SPEAKER_00]: on our strains, but we got those from
somebody else 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of like the, you know,
the give it away, you know, adage,
[SPEAKER_07]: or maybe it's a Grateful Dead vibe,
you know, you could, the tapes were not,
[SPEAKER_07]: you could never sell them.
[SPEAKER_07]: You had to give them away and it only made
everything better.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, when we gave our, we give our
seeds away to say Nick and Liz at
[SPEAKER_07]: Greensource gardens and they come out with
something that they liked, like they loved
[SPEAKER_07]: the Zellies gift and they're like,
oh my God, I'm going to put that into some
[SPEAKER_07]: of my genetics.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, to me, I'm like, oh, that's,
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: You saw something in our genetics that
we're working with the, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: go for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, make whatever you want out of
it, you know, have it, have an awesome
[SPEAKER_07]: time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't wait to see the plans.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so we, why would we have seed
exchanges and seed swaps all the time,
[SPEAKER_07]: everywhere we go, every single event that
we do, if we were worried about patenting
[SPEAKER_07]: or owning anything, I think we just,
it's so diverse, just fall in love with
[SPEAKER_07]: the diversity and just not worry about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, that's kind of what we feel right
now.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've always given our genetics away.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not going to patent them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, and I get it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really weird that this, you know,
guy is coming in with a three piece suit
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's never even smoked cannabis,
but he wants to rule the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had this tight knit,
beautiful cannabis community for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is my entire adult life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like a whole new transition
that I'm, I'm sitting at the table with
[SPEAKER_00]: these people that are talking about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I know you've never even
smoked it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a, it's a really interesting
dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it comes back to what I
was saying before, you know, if,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we don't want the castle to be given
away, then don't give away the keys,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, keep your genetic tight within
the people that you love and see what they
[SPEAKER_00]: can do with it and be happy that they're
creating something awesome and be really
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful that your own genetics came from
somebody else that worked on them for a
really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be grateful to them rather than
feeling like you've got some sort of an
[SPEAKER_00]: ownership over it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Josh, I heard about the license
producer stealing our genetics and doing
[SPEAKER_07]: better than we can with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like go for it, but you're just going to
steal the genetic and put it into like a
[SPEAKER_07]: stupid system.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not going to come out the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just kind of like, ah,
you know, and, and, you know, anyway,
[SPEAKER_07]: so we, we, we loved the idea of open
source.
[SPEAKER_07]: We loved the idea of being able to see the
genetics and being able to see the
[SPEAKER_07]: connections.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the coolest thing about the idea
of the galaxy or something like that
[SPEAKER_07]: during the time was to be able to say,
Hey, this is connected to all this
[SPEAKER_07]: lineage.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, that, that would be really
interesting for us in genetics,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I think we're moving into a time that
we're almost moving away from strains on
[SPEAKER_07]: some levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're just looking at plants more like
chemo bars and what their chemical
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds or their terpenes are and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, I don't know, there's a lot of
ways to work with the cannabis once it's
[SPEAKER_07]: grown now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something I wanted to ask, which is
kind of related, but not really about
[SPEAKER_03]: genomic mapping type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen a few people post more and more
frequently about how SAP analysis from
[SPEAKER_03]: leafs can be used as like a nutrient
profiling technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about that as kind of the
basis for the evaluation of a nutrient
[SPEAKER_03]: program or kind of some new things you're
implementing within your own cultivars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anytime that you can learn more
about the plant, that's all really
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting and adding a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And SAP analysis has been happening with,
with all different types of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, within agriculture for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now people are just starting to talk
about it with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just another way to look at,
you know, how well your plant is uptaking
[SPEAKER_00]: different minerals and different
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really going to still come down
to the microbiology and, and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: present and everything in your soil as
well as leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also an incredible,
you know, intuitive value of being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at a plant and be able to get a
feeling for it and say, yeah, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and you just know that it's
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, what I would
suggest to people that are listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: this is create a better relationship with,
with your plants in your house,
[SPEAKER_00]: with your cannabis plants, with your
garden plants, with the plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: around your property, because that's going
to give you a better, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: communication and a better relationship
with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I think that we have this deep
connection with plants as human beings on
[SPEAKER_00]: the earth, because we eat them,
we cultivate them, we can't really live
[SPEAKER_00]: without them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They create our oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The symbiosis is so deep, that I feel like
that's a really beautiful thing to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to see the health and well being of your
plants is just being in tune with that DNA
[SPEAKER_00]: connection that we have with plants on the
earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think a SAP analysis, you know,
is going to tell you, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: whether you have enough, you know,
trace minerals, or whether it's,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, a strong reading or a high
number or not, but it's not going to tell
[SPEAKER_07]: you, oh, you need more magnesium.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's not going to be like,
oh, you're, you're, you're high on boron
[SPEAKER_07]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, there is this going to take a
level of intuition.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the, that it's extremely
crucial maybe to use the SAP analysis as,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, part of your analysis,
you know, and then, and then you also have
[SPEAKER_07]: a soil analysis that you have been able
to, you know, and, and, and with soil
[SPEAKER_07]: tests and soil analysis, you are able to,
to test, you know, your organic matter
[SPEAKER_07]: counts in your microbiology.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, and I think at the end of the
day, you're just going to, you're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: recognize, oh, well, this soil is really
rich enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when you have a really live
living, rich soil, like on our land right
[SPEAKER_07]: now, our greenhouses and all of our land
is like, I'm feeling super good right now
[SPEAKER_07]: about the plants getting into the soil
right now and just taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even, even when you test a soil and
you could test the soil and then you could
[SPEAKER_00]: say, oh, well, it's got these certain
amount of minerals, but you still don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what the plant is uptaking or what
the plant is not uptaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, diversity in your soil is so
important for the ultimate health of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, because then it gives the plant the
ability to uptake what it needs as it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, a soil analysis after every
flower cycle is really helpful if you're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing indoors, you know, and outdoors,
maybe once at the end of the year or
[SPEAKER_07]: something, unless you're light stepping
and then, you know, you could test it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think what we've just come to is
just add more raw materials, create more
[SPEAKER_07]: biology and just make it just a crazy worm
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: A crazy worm farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that analogy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty much what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we see the claim that there's a lot of
the hydroponically or synthetically
[SPEAKER_03]: produced, what people would refer to as
tally bud, most notably strains like
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies and gelatos.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll often be kind of commented that,
oh, those are full of PGRs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just look at the way they look,
you know, you can tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And likewise, we don't see people like the
cookie fam or people who produce these
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars really talking much about the
nutrients they use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like if someone doesn't want
to disclose something as seemingly simple
[SPEAKER_03]: as their nutrient regime, it's not too far
fetched to assume that maybe something
[SPEAKER_03]: more than what meets the eye is going on
behind the scenes?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, you know, my guess is that
they're surviving every single round that
[SPEAKER_07]: they're getting through.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, they're just stoked they
have weed at the end of the run.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and plus, you know, it's with
cookies and different varieties like that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it's they're hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it's it can be it's a
finicky plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have like the big, you know,
harvest and the big, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: buds or whatever like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, I mean, I think if you have
to question it, don't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you have to question it and
you don't know what people's growing
[SPEAKER_00]: practices are because they're not out
there in the open and they're being
[SPEAKER_00]: secretive and private about their growing
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's not IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: People try to say, oh, my growing regimen
is IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, intellectual property and what you're
feeding your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's a big red flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just people that are more, you know,
upstanding about what it is that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and what they're adding is the
people that you want to support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you I mean, you kind of touched
on the point right there, but how do you
[SPEAKER_03]: feel about organic companies that like
maybe produce a nutrients or a soil?
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, they it won't release specific
information about maybe the ingredients
[SPEAKER_03]: they use.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, they say it's IP or it's
proprietary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's you know, even if it's quite an
organic product, it's just it still needs
[SPEAKER_03]: to be viewed with suspicion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I can only say what we've
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at any of our products,
it has every single ingredient in it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it has the exact ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we say to people is everything
that we put out is something that is good
[SPEAKER_00]: for the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to learn from it and,
you know, you want to copy it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's not what we're necessarily
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for us to be able to be forthright is
just really important because I just I
[SPEAKER_00]: just think that it's important to share
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people are not sharing,
then of course, you got to wonder,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what kind of skeletons do they have
in their closet?
[SPEAKER_00]: And and people will say, well,
you know, people can grow and make your
[SPEAKER_00]: product and go and do it themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, you know, more power to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it hurt our business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to buy our products because it
says exactly what's on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no different than if you go to a
grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what ingredients every
single ingredient in the food I'm eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no different than in what I'm
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm putting in my soil is what I'm
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, I want to know every single
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's pretty obvious.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you favor a fungal or a bacterial
dog?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
I do.
I do.
I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any ideas or do you just kind
of let the plant do what it wants?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we let the plant do it at once and
but we also so.
[SPEAKER_07]: But having said that, I would say that we
would we would go.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't just.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, from material to fungal dominant,
you know, based off your cycle,
[SPEAKER_07]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you kind of have to choose like,
you know, a soil that you feel is really
[SPEAKER_07]: live and rich and a fungal dominant soil
is really, really important for nutrient
[SPEAKER_07]: breakdown and metabolization.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would want a nutrient, a fungal
dominant soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe for the vegetative, we would use
some of our fermented plant juice or some
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of high bacterial plant juice teas to
be able to get some of that nitrogen or
[SPEAKER_07]: growth hormones in the vegetative cycle.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would that's how we would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fungi and bacteria, they work
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's so important to have both
of them in the soil at a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity and a large amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you want to have lots of
colonization of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like within our body,
if we were to check our own microbiome,
[SPEAKER_00]: it changes from day to day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changes with whether it's a cool day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got like lots of bacteria
that wants to come right up onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of the soil or whether it's super
hot and they go really deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the plants uptake is going to change
from day to day as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you've got like an indoor
situation, what we've been learning more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more is that you have what we were
going into gardens, you know, many years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago and doing consultations and taking a
lot of microbiology, a look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology that was happening within the
soil as well as nutrient and what was
[SPEAKER_00]: going on with the mineral ratios and all
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were realizing that in cannabis
indoor gardens, there's a tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of bacteria and people were really
trying to grow these plants that were
[SPEAKER_00]: super bacteria rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have soils that are super
bacterial rich, then you have such a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater chance of any type of a pathogen
coming in and taking that over because
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi is so incredibly voracious and it's
very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it becomes like a garden,
it's going to be harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's a pathogen that's going on
the soil or you've got sphusarium or
[SPEAKER_00]: pythium or any type of a root rot like
that, you know, your fungi is the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be, you know, right there
at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fungi is so incredibly important to
have within your soil at all times,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as bacteria feeding your plant
foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there was that thought that
fungi is the only thing that can break
[SPEAKER_00]: down phosphorus and yes, that's totally
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then people started saying,
well, now you want to have a really fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: rich, you know, environment more in
flowering because it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking down the phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also plants are still going to decide
from day to day and colonization is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to ebb and flow within that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding a lot of different types of food
in your soil that's going to feed your
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial fungi and your beneficial
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is really ideal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Higher amounts of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a kind of a zoomed out
question, but I've been thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: this one a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we go about raising the value,
be it perceived or just simply in the
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we go about raising the value of
sun-grown cannabis in the mind of
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the end goal to get it on par with
indoor or is it simply a case of
[SPEAKER_03]: outproducing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think it's partly it's create good
sun-grown flower.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, show show where it can
shine, so to speak, with it with its sun
[SPEAKER_07]: and, you know, and just helping people
realize the ecological impact.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think a lot of people when they go to
stores or dispensaries or they look online
[SPEAKER_07]: and they're buying, I think they if
they've come across a co-op of farms or a
[SPEAKER_07]: farm itself and they have the opportunity
to buy from a farm that's doing something
[SPEAKER_07]: that's ecologically sound and positive
that I believe that that does add the
[SPEAKER_07]: value, adds value and we've seen that with
farms and we've seen that with
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensaries that like Soulful in
California is a really good, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: example of a place that's really shown,
you know, let's say Californians what good
[SPEAKER_07]: sun-grown looks like and the farms that
grow it, you know, and there's farms that
[SPEAKER_07]: they work with and the farmers go into the
place and they talk about their product
[SPEAKER_07]: and they meet the farmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when regenerative farmers all join
together, then we can actually set the
[SPEAKER_00]: value of what super high quality flower
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think it's important to
hear that, you know, we really appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: all of the indoor, you know, growers out
there that don't have an option to be
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, thank goodness for you for
supporting, you know, sick people and
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting patients and supporting your
friends to not be drinking or taking hard
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs, you know, showing them the way with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that, you know, indoor has really
helped bring the plant forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she's been the one that's been
incredibly persecuted and if we can hold
[SPEAKER_00]: these strains and still have these indoor
gardens well, we're activists and still
[SPEAKER_00]: having a voice for that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're not, I think that
there's an incredible value in indoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when you're just still
respecting the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I don't know if the conversation is so
much about indoor or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's about like respectful way
that the plant is grown.
[SPEAKER_07]: Conscious cultivation, you know,
I mean, what's valuable about sun-grown is
[SPEAKER_07]: that it's positively impacting the earth
as we've talked about numerous times
[SPEAKER_07]: already tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a real, why that's important.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then if you're looking at,
you know, cannabis as an industry,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it is a plant that is naturally
grown under the sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so to be able to support farms that do
that, you know, is really valuable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've really seen, you know,
farms have more value with their plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, you kind of have to be,
you have to be a jack of all trades.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to be a farmer and you have to be
able to really share your story in a way
[SPEAKER_07]: that's enticing and really helpful to
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really important to us that these
people who are cultivating this plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: have a tight relationship with this plant
have a future with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so important that the cannabis
community and the cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_00]: continues forward, that corporate,
you know, takeover doesn't completely
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we believe that that's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to happen by people producing
the least amount of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cost per gram for them to be able to stay
in this industry and for them to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue their cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another reason why we really
encourage people to do sun-grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: to do outdoor light debt, to use the sun
because it's so much less expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is really being able to offer that
alternative to the corporate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to stay in business and a good way
to stay in business is to save a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: On that same topic of sun-grown cannabis,
what types of companion plants do you
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend to use in conjunction with
cannabis farming?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because recently I've seen some posts that
criticize clover, which is often held to
[SPEAKER_03]: be a really good companion plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people are saying, oh,
you know, it just robs the soil of
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really that good.
[SPEAKER_03]: What things do you recommend to go
alongside your cannabis cuttings?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, clover is an indicator.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it can be an indication.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be a communicator that tells you
whether you have bugs or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wouldn't say that it's, you know,
creating the problem at all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And part of using clover as a cover crop
is to understand how to use it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you wouldn't want to let it grow
too long to get super infected.
[SPEAKER_07]: You would want to, you know, kind of work
it into the top layer of your soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you keep it, you know, young and
vibrant, you know, it's way less likely to
[SPEAKER_07]: have any pathogens on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So learning how to use your cover crop is
really important.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some, you know, buckwheat is a really
good companion plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sudenese sorghum grass is a cover crop and
a companion plant that you can use that
[SPEAKER_07]: colonizes mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it can help build the colonies of grass
and of mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also cover crop, what's around?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, see what's thriving in your zone
and area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in an outdoor farm, you know,
see what's thriving in your zone and area
[SPEAKER_00]: for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, we just showed a bunch of
pictures on our Instagram of our plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are coming up and people said,
oh, you know, what kind of cover crops did
[SPEAKER_00]: you plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a ton of them in there,
but we didn't actually plant any yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just what's coming up in the native
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another really huge benefit on
utilizing closed loop methods that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: just see what wants to come up and what
wants to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for indoor scenarios or people that
just have like, you know, maybe a small
[SPEAKER_00]: garden that isn't that connected to
nature, we really love to rotate our cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops and start out with sort of a
nitrogen rich one that breaks down really
[SPEAKER_00]: easily like chickweed at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it can move more into a quinoa is
a wonderful one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buckwheat is another great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can start moving into more
like phosphorus rich and potassium rich
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do a corn if you wanted to,
if you grow your own corn, but whatever
[SPEAKER_07]: your- Comfrey is one that people use a
lot, but it's one that gets powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_07]: if it stays alive a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you almost kind of have to keep that
cut down and really fresh too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another thing is that you were
talking about clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sort of getting a bad rap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it gets a bad rap because people are
leaving it too long maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, more things will
colonize on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really love to pull up our cover
crop and lay down a new one continuously.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that, I mean, pretty soon it's
going to be exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be able to have hemp as a
cover crop because, you know, we're
[SPEAKER_00]: producing so much hemp seed that we're
going to be able to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: have that also and see what that's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just continuously trying new
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you can use lemon balms and holy
basil and different things, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: around in your gardens and not as a cover
crop because then it would go crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I mean, you know, nettles grow
all around, but that's not necessarily the
[SPEAKER_07]: best cover crop either, but we kind of
have it as a cover crop in our area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poppy is a really amazing cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow poppy flowers and it contains
the highest amount of phosphorus in a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant varietal that we know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you take a whole bunch of poppy seed
and it only takes a few poppy heads to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a massive cover crop in your indoor garden
or even in a massive outdoor garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's like immediately readily
available phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always like to end our flowering
with poppy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in between, you can just look at
different values, mineral values of
[SPEAKER_00]: different seed varietals and say,
oh yeah, that would be cool to try during
[SPEAKER_00]: this time and use your intuition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use your creativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come up with new things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about finding what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a few different UK grow and hydro
stores now stocking some of your products,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is absolutely fantastic to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I note this because the UK is historically
been a very kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: hydro or soilless dominated market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like the tides are finally
turning in this regard?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how can we help to crack hydro store
strongholds, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just through education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that even the hydro stores,
you know, have been taught the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were taught by big ag, you know,
NPK ratios, and they thought that that was
[SPEAKER_00]: what was the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we have the opportunity to bring a
totally regeneratively grown indoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: deep cultivated soil with Dragonfly Earth
medicine, buds into a hydro store and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at what is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an incredible education,
you know, to them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do I think that the tides are turning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tides are definitely turning and the
tides are turning because microbiology is
[SPEAKER_00]: making a comeback in the camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more that we create healthy
microbiology, the more healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology enters our own microbiome,
which makes us more intelligent,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes us make better decisions,
which helps us educate the grow stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I think that, you know,
like I said before, we're on an incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: bell curve and we all just need to run
with that and not feel like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, if I'm just getting into the game
and I'm just learning about this,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have nothing to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have tons to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has something to offer that is
some kind of a teaching around nature or a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to do it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's better for the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see on some of these stores that you
guys have got your own molasses product,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is great because I always had people
ask me a lot of questions about molasses
[SPEAKER_03]: and some of the variants like treacle and
the black strap molasses and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What type of molasses do you guys like to
use and how do you like to use it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, definitely organic black strap
molasses would be, you know, something
[SPEAKER_07]: that people usually cut corners on,
but we're not, we don't actually even use
[SPEAKER_07]: molasses anymore, you know, or any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't actually have a molasses
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's, that was the dragonfly
Europe and that, yeah, so that was,
[SPEAKER_07]: there was some, you know, an outfit in
Europe to have it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the point is, do you use molasses or
not?
[SPEAKER_07]: And initially it was like, you know,
tablespoon per gallon molasses and that's
[SPEAKER_07]: going to add to your microbiology.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I feel over the years of testing that
the sweetener and adding molasses and
[SPEAKER_07]: sugars has really been overdone and could
potentially spike pathogens in your teas
[SPEAKER_07]: as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're going to use molasses,
make sure it's organic because a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: people will cut that corner.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can be a really good iron or
mineral supplement to your teas,
[SPEAKER_07]: but I would not overuse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But use it in very trace amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's such a tremendous amount of sugars
already in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we can really see that
with, if you're feeding your soil a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of sugars, it's really no different
than if you're feeding your own body a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot of sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have more yeast problems,
which is, you know, pathogenic yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soils sort of have that more mildews.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have all different types of,
yeah, it's going to throw off your pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make it way more acidic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be really careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nature, you know, plants survive off
other plant juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't really like molasses that
comes into nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really think about your microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and like I was talking about before,
you know, that first drop and how many
[SPEAKER_00]: ripples it can create, you know,
look at that last ripple and you,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want it to be a healthy balance
all the way through.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you use lactic acid bacteria to
break down plant, you know, juices and
[SPEAKER_07]: weeds, there's, there's a lot of living
material in there and a lot of sugars that
[SPEAKER_07]: are just naturally present.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's, it's kind of a, it balances
itself out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't use any extra sugars on our
property.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if someone did want to use sugars,
like in say like a molasses form or
[SPEAKER_03]: something along those lines, is there one
that you would use preferentially?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've had someone ask me,
you know, should I use honey?
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I use molasses?
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I use agave nectar?
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it came down to it, I thought,
well, molasses has got a few little extra
[SPEAKER_03]: minerals in it, but I mean, I'm not sure
if there's too much of a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honey can have all different, its own
different microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honey is alive, especially if it's
non-pasteurized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has so many different types of things
in it so that it can throw off.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be antibacterial in some forms too
and different things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, is raw of a good sugars you
can get that's not highly processed and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's totally organic is the one that we
suggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also to use it in very, very low
ratios, a half a teaspoon per gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: really is all you need to spark those
initial, that initial microbiology sparks
[SPEAKER_00]: those initial bacteria, but it's really no
different in a brew than in the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're feeling a low blood
sugar and you eat a candy bar,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that that candy bar is only going
to last so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you eat like something really high
protein and really rich and full balanced,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's going to keep your blood sugar
going for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the teas are no different in,
you know, you don't want to burn out your
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to give it something that it can
feed off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long term as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the best, I think the best syrup or
the best sweetener that you can use is
[SPEAKER_07]: Yakone syrup.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll spell that Y-A-C-O-N.
[SPEAKER_07]: And Yakone is a South American tuber
that's really watery and really sweet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a prebiotic that's really high in
inulin.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can be really good for human
consumption as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's often boiled down and and juiced
and it creates a molasses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are growing a lot of Yakone on our
property and encouraging a lot of farmers
[SPEAKER_07]: to grow Yakone on their property.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's a real and you can also
sometimes find it in a natural food store.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yakone syrup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aaron, you hear that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Store that away in a neuron somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you say to someone who says
that they really want to get into organics
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, they really feel
passionately about the general message
[SPEAKER_03]: being put forward by Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, they just feel like they can't
quite get their crops high enough to merit
[SPEAKER_03]: switching over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you just have to try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's no different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you try something new,
there's always a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be a learning curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if there's no learning curve,
then we wouldn't be learning how to get
[SPEAKER_00]: better and better at things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hear that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also hear the same person say
that come back a year later and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, my God, are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even believe that I ever thought
that I couldn't have higher yields or that
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't grow better medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that organics and living
natural biological soils is the way to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what plants grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was humans that took them and put them
in some other type of a medium and tried
[SPEAKER_00]: to create that growing cultivation
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think, give it a little bit of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get new ideas and share them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's just about the ending
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the journey along the way and
all of the good information that you're
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're going to get and all of the
good microbiology that you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: along the way as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to help you become a better
gardener in the end anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if this was someone's primary concern
for switching to organics, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're forced to grow in a non-organic
way, just specifically to get enough yield
[SPEAKER_03]: to say support yourself, do you feel like
there's been a certain something missed
[SPEAKER_03]: there in respects to their relationship
with the plant?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what's missing is that it's actually
the opposite that in a lot of legalized
[SPEAKER_07]: and recreational jurisdictions,
it's actually you have to grow it
[SPEAKER_07]: regeneratively organically in order to
pass all these tests.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of turned into a good thing
for an organic farmer, because in the end,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's kind of, yeah, I think a lot of
people have said, oh, well, in these new
[SPEAKER_07]: systems, you almost have to grow
organically because there's too many
[SPEAKER_07]: residues and different things that show
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you have to ask yourself,
what are you having your relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you having your relationship with the
fear of losing your job and being forced
[SPEAKER_00]: into something that you may not believe in
and may not even be part of your ethics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you having a relationship with the
cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's just something that you
want to ask yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just want to have a
relationship with the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do a nine to five and not think about
anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a whole lot of people on the
planet like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally want to have a relationship
with everything that I do in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know Josh feels the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want to be involved and want to be
able to have integrity with what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing so that we can be proud of it and so
that we can be interested in it and so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can remain creative with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not just working a nine to five
and we're looking at the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a way that I could really tell
people who only are looking at that bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line, polyculture is equally as important
as polyeconomy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot just be growing cannabis maybe
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not have an early spring crop of
strawberries on your land or try to
[SPEAKER_00]: diversify with other things?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't just be selling a pound of weed
anymore and think that that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: suffice for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to become product makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to have an ending product that
brings more value to our flowers so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can bring value to organics and have a
higher quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to become more creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what's going to give us more
value for what we're doing and more value
[SPEAKER_00]: for the product in the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you think we can go about
raising the general perception in the mind
[SPEAKER_03]: of the consumers about the quality of
outdoor?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because at the moment, as maybe
ideologically inaccurate as it may be,
[SPEAKER_03]: there is the general consensus that people
want to quote that indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we go about changing that so that
people are demanding that high quality
[SPEAKER_03]: organic outdoor?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think it matters where you live.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that people are not being able to
see good quality outdoor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, the indoor that's around,
people think that it's just about the
[SPEAKER_07]: looks when it's really about so much more
than that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's just a matter of
education.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, we've brought our cannabis to
different cups and different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, it's incredibly crystaly and
it looks really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: It smells really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that in certain ways,
we've redefined what's even possible to
[SPEAKER_07]: grow outdoors up in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, light deprivation has added
a lot of quality to sun grown plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: So light depth is a really easy sell to
people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that just having a good cure
and a good quality way of harvesting your
[SPEAKER_07]: sun grown and just being able to do it
right, I think when people say,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, can I make the leap of faith to
organics?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's not much of an actual leap
because, you know, just building a really
[SPEAKER_07]: good soil and having a really quality,
stable base within your soil is going to
[SPEAKER_07]: give you the ability to take advantage of
the sun and create, you know, good flour
[SPEAKER_07]: from it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we see really amazing outdoor sun grown
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think, you know, it's possible to do
it in other areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, it's what it's what makes
people feel better most of the time,
[SPEAKER_07]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that people who say that,
you know, indoor is better than sun grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just haven't had good sun grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's really what it comes down
to, which is what Josh pretty much just
[SPEAKER_00]: said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more sun grown that's out there
with really good varietals that do well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the sun, because what people
are doing is that they're taking these
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor varietals or a clone or a seed that
it's been grown indoors for a really long
[SPEAKER_00]: time in a synthetic environment or in a
soilless medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they try to grow it outside and
they don't understand why it doesn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that plant doesn't have the
intelligence of a natural system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lost its intelligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lost the ability, you know,
to be able to uptake and grow to its full
[SPEAKER_00]: potential because it's only been used to
sort of that IV feeding more allopathic
[SPEAKER_00]: and PK that doesn't understand
microbiology or an endophytic reaction
[SPEAKER_00]: within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, outdoor is really wonderful
when you're working with outdoor strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like Josh said, I mean,
I wish I could give every single person
[SPEAKER_00]: out there listening, you know,
one of our flowers and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would they would say something really
different.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's often a really good feeling
that comes with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if we hear that a lot,
you know, people smoke our weed and
[SPEAKER_07]: they're like, oh, you know, I usually have
a certain feeling associated with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think when you get a really good sun
grown herb and even within in our
[SPEAKER_07]: experience, people have a better feeling
from it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, if you're why are you smoking
the weed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you smoking the weed because of what
it looks like?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are you smoking the weed because of how
it feels?
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe, you know, challenge yourself on
on why you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Pure Seal itself is very much a
communally orientated and accredited
[SPEAKER_03]: certification.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you see this model expanding into other
facets of the community over, say,
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple avenues?
[SPEAKER_03]: And specifically, do you think we'll ever
see something like, say, a pure dispensary
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's just full of flowers and
products produced under the Pure
[SPEAKER_03]: Certification?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's happening already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is already happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And product makers want to have the pure
certification so that they're only
[SPEAKER_00]: sourcing flowers from pure certified
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it creates this beautiful sacred
commerce that's regenerative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there's been lots of talk about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's dispensaries that totally want to
come on board and see what that's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're looking at as a whole
collective right now is different
[SPEAKER_00]: certifications that still pure certified
that represents that same really high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and community monitoring and
community run.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the questions that got submitted by
one of our fans was if they say just
[SPEAKER_03]: bought stock standard, because I know that
there's so many variables here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say they bought a pretty
standard farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long would you guess it would take for
them to get it up into shape to the point
[SPEAKER_03]: where it would probably pass the Pure
Certification?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's really hard to say.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it would take having, you know,
when we say closed systems, that means
[SPEAKER_07]: some type of system that works on top of
itself, some compost or some, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: good things that you have that you're
catching water, saving water, making your
[SPEAKER_07]: own seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I would say, you know,
you can't just get it in within two weeks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe you've bought someone else's farm
that's already done something really
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you could actually, you know,
come in and pretty quickly then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've we've had people take, you know,
five years that are just coming to it that
[SPEAKER_00]: said we're finally ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been five years in the making and we
really want to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've had other farms that have
done it in one year that they put all of
[SPEAKER_00]: their energy and effort in and every bit
that they had, you know, to creating more
[SPEAKER_00]: closed loop systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really not a time thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an energy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also depending on where you are,
because if you're in the tropics,
[SPEAKER_00]: being closed loop is a whole lot easier
than if you're in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's different variables
for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is really cool is that the
tremendous amount of closed loops that
[SPEAKER_00]: have come to our attention, you know,
like people have created closed loops out
[SPEAKER_00]: of just pure brilliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yet again, it brings that intuitive
sense of creativity and that your land is
[SPEAKER_00]: specific to you and that, you know,
everybody is a little bit different in the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that you do things on your own land or
in your own indoor garden or your own tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's a holistic certification.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, you have to be ready to not
be using non toxic substances like butane
[SPEAKER_07]: or propane or some type of high we don't
allow hydrocarbon extracts like we've
[SPEAKER_07]: talked about before.
[SPEAKER_07]: And people can, you know, tell us how
clean it is and they can give us tests and
[SPEAKER_07]: they'll say all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the end, we just for us,
it's a toxic compound.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to clean a toxic compound out seems
counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just it's it's supporting an
industry that creates a toxic compound.
[SPEAKER_07]: And and that's not OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as a pure certified farmer,
you just have to be able to have a food
[SPEAKER_07]: garden and you have to be able to have
flowers growing and you have to be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: have some, you know, ways of making soil
and you have to be able to have a
[SPEAKER_07]: functional farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, that can come within one
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might take a few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to change the topic ever so slightly,
what are some cultivars or strains you've
[SPEAKER_03]: been vibing with a lot lately?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, there's a lot of hemp
strains that are being, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: explored.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those are really interesting to us
right now because some of them are,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, really high in terpenes and and
other ones are high in CBG and other ones
[SPEAKER_07]: are high in the THCB and different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now, we're just really interested
in exploring, you know, cultivars.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cultivars that are unique, you know,
I mean, and and so some of those cultivars
[SPEAKER_07]: are I mean, the cherry wine has been
around for a while as a hemp cultivar.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've been playing around with the
cherry wine and the auto and the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_07]: And those have been really interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, we're we're looking into doing
some more varieties on that front.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been still, you know,
moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our own varietals, you know,
we have our 840 male that we still work
[SPEAKER_00]: with, as well as other males that have
been made off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our Zellies gift, we rejuvenated
this year and we did some inline breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: with it way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something that's been really
interesting to us is we brought out a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of our early 2000 seeds just recently for
all of our varietals on for this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're growing them again,
so we can re-breed those back in and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can really create stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're seeing in stability,
which, you know, stability is a shaky term
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're seeing is as we bring even
our lineage further of what's interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: to us, we're choosing plants and then
they're being tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really moving into and most of our
varieties are full spectrum, full terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just seems to be coming naturally
with with treating them well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been even seeing some of our
old like Temple Spice varietal now that's
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to have CBD creep into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, you know, we're moving
along our own stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and like Josh said, we're like now 80
percent hemp on our property and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: really interested in working with the hemp
varietal that finishes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our really big goal this year in
breeding is to try to bring forth an early
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing high CBD hemp varietal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also we're working with some auto
flower seeds that we got from Heart Rock
[SPEAKER_07]: Mountain and the Cali Gold.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's been a project they've been
working on for a long time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're excited to, you know,
to work with some auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we are, you know, working with some
hash varieties that we've gotten from,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, Kush Kirk and and some 24K
varieties and some Snapple cookie
[SPEAKER_07]: varieties and different things like that
just to see, you know, what kind of syrup
[SPEAKER_07]: we can get.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we have reindeer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Reindeer syrup is is another variety
that's a root or alice strain that we've
[SPEAKER_07]: been, you know, that we're that we're
going to try out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's really interesting this
year.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we've gotten a lot of strains from
a lot of different people this year and
[SPEAKER_07]: we're just doing our best to do a little
bit of everything just to see to further
[SPEAKER_07]: explore, you know, what we're what we can
grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we've got some land race
varieties happening, some Milana creams
[SPEAKER_07]: going.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really nice diverse mix of genetics there.
[SPEAKER_03]: When can we expect to see the launch
itself of Dragonfly genetics?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a few people have told me they're
hunting for your seeds like nothing else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the struggle is real to get
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly seems like there's demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: When is it going to be time?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, maybe we'll do some this fall,
this fall.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be a good idea to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, we have given out a lot of
seeds when we see people.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I guess it's just a matter
of, you know, making it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we make a whole lot of seeds every
year and we give them all away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our genetics are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it's just people that see us
in passing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're happy to gift them with varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do always ask people, you know,
how are you going to grow these?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a really nice idea for us to know
that our seeds are going out into a
[SPEAKER_00]: respectful garden or, you know,
somebody that's going to turn them into
[SPEAKER_00]: something really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just keep giving them away and people
keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we give away too many to
actually sell any.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_07]: What we really want is a field test kit so
that we can really do, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of the breeding that we're really,
you know, analyzing on our own property.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, eventually we get a good
field testing kit and that would really
[SPEAKER_07]: help our breeding and that would really
help us, you know, feel good about putting
[SPEAKER_07]: seeds out into the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that you have some interesting
kind of collaborations or at least working
[SPEAKER_03]: closely with Snodgrass, Family Farm
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell us a little more about this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, they have really amazing
breeding products that they're a part of.
[SPEAKER_07]: And since they're, you know, family to us,
you know, we've traded genetics back and
[SPEAKER_07]: forth over the years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really, Bobby and Meredith just have a
really beautiful piece of land and they're
[SPEAKER_07]: just exploring, you know, genetics that
have come to them throughout their thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't have any collaboration,
you know, official collaborations
[SPEAKER_07]: happening at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than we've been sharing seeds for
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And breeding off of each other's stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that way, it's really collaborative.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it would be really fun to come out
with something together when we come with
[SPEAKER_07]: something, when we get to something that's
really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, I would know that every year
they explore a huge variety of genetics
[SPEAKER_07]: and do a lot of breeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's always really interesting to find
out what they come up with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And would you ever consider doing like a
rather formal collab with someone who you
[SPEAKER_03]: really closely align with?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe, you know, Duke Diamond or
someone along those lines who you respect
[SPEAKER_03]: and vibe with their work already?
[SPEAKER_03]: Always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all about collaborating,
you know, in any way that we can with
[SPEAKER_00]: information, with, you know, good flowers,
with seeds.
[SPEAKER_07]: We even have some heavy days genetics
going on right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_07]: We're pretty stoked.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, there could be a collab
coming right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big grin on my face.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks very much, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next thing I wanted to ask is...
And they're coming up really beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super excited about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are too kind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you're giving them a very loving
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we for sure are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, how important is
it in your opinion to continually be feno
[SPEAKER_03]: hunting?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's what makes it exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're not feno hunting, then I always
feel like, well, what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything that we've gotten up
to this point we did without, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: only maybe in the last five years have we
been doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even any testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was feno hunting and what it
smelled like and what it looked like and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it did in the garden and what it made
you feel like when you smelled it or
[SPEAKER_00]: touched it or you're next to it or when
you smoked it or you ingested it or put it
[SPEAKER_00]: into your food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, feno hunting is being a cannabis
cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a bit of a peculiar one,
but I really wanted to kind of dig in
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I tried some Mack one that was grown
in the States outdoors with, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the kind of the pure type of... I think it
was grown on a pure farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, if not, we'll just say,
you know, very closely aligned with that
[SPEAKER_03]: type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, it just didn't come
across to me as it was on the same level
[SPEAKER_03]: as some of the indoor stuff in terms of
the caps, in terms of the Mack
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my question is, do you feel like
there may be some cuttings that are just
[SPEAKER_03]: more suited for outdoor than indoor or for
indoor than outdoor?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think that anything has the
potential to shine just as good in either
[SPEAKER_03]: or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that I touched on that a
little bit before is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of these varietals have been grown
indoor for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been cuttings off of indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been put in synthetic or soil-less
mediums and they don't really have the
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence to go into an outdoor
cultivation, you know, methodology or
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, particularly with the Mack,
that's a really indoor varietal and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's been cloned off a whole
bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it would take, you know,
several runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we ever get an indoor clone from
somebody or something that we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in wanting to grow out,
we take a couple of years to grow it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what its full potential is because
guaranteed, if we're getting a synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: clone from somebody, it takes a long time
for that clone to come to its full
[SPEAKER_00]: potential because it doesn't have the
intelligence of biological uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's gonna take some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the plant's intelligence
needs to match the intelligence of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something I wanted to ask you guys your
perspective on was the use of,
[SPEAKER_03]: quote, natural growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know that I've heard and seen a lot
of people using gibberellic acid in the
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetative stages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people will consider this to be
on par, if not the same thing as using
[SPEAKER_03]: PGRs, you know, the more kind of synthetic
natural ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: But other people will say, oh,
but it's just a natural hormone that's in
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, where do you sit on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you view it as a natural thing or as a
synthetic thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, gibberellic acid is a natural
compound that's found in nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wouldn't say it's not a synthetic
compound, but I think that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: anything that's been, it could be that
it's synthesized and it could be that some
[SPEAKER_07]: of those, I think it's kind of like,
do you like isolate, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD or do you like full spectrum?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, medicine, I think that,
you know, when you start just using
[SPEAKER_07]: gibberellic acid on its own, you know,
you're, you're, you just don't know what
[SPEAKER_07]: the source is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that you can get plenty of
gibberellic acid just in like nettles or,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, in some kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would just much rather get it from
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, to me, that's just,
it's kind of like using an isolate.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so would you view it, I guess,
just as a clarifying point, as somewhat
[SPEAKER_03]: akin to tricontinol where it's like,
yeah, we just get it from the alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be, that's a perfect analogy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's kind of like, yeah,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, you know, human's desire to
think that it's one compound over the all.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not to say, you know, CBD on its own
can cure, but you know, the whole
[SPEAKER_07]: entourage is way better.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gibberellic acid, you know, on its own can
grow plants exponentially.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've even heard with feminization that
gibberellic acid used in conjunction with
[SPEAKER_07]: colloidal silver in the early flowering
stages can be a way to feminize your
[SPEAKER_07]: plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: Silver theosulfate, which is what's
commonly used for feminization.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, gibberellic acid is,
is, is a really heavy growth hormone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So anything that's isolated like that,
we're just automatically skeptical of and
[SPEAKER_07]: we don't use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to take a bit of a step off
the edge here and talk about something
[SPEAKER_03]: random that I saw the other day on
Instagram, but I'd love to gauge your
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about the introduction
of mushroom spores from psychedelic
[SPEAKER_03]: mushrooms into your grow media?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I mean, I'm sure we've all seen
the odd mushroom pop its head up
[SPEAKER_03]: throughout a flowering cycle when you flip
the lights on.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if it turns out, you know,
you had some cubensis or something like
[SPEAKER_03]: that pop up?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I think then you would have
the most awesome thing in the world
[SPEAKER_07]: happening, you know, because who,
who wouldn't want psychedelic mushroom was
[SPEAKER_07]: popping up underneath their, their ganja.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, any, any sane person would want
that, you know?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to, I'm going to say that,
you know, to say psychedelic mushrooms is,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, a little bit broad.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'd have to go a little bit deeper.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd say, okay, which ones do I want?
[SPEAKER_07]: Wood loving psychedelic natural mushrooms
like Azure essence or cyanescence or,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, uh, potent psilocybe, which is already
the cyanescence.
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, those are wood loving.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you, you could inoculate, um,
you could get wild spores and wild patches
[SPEAKER_07]: and mycelium and, and, and inoculate those
in your grow medium.
[SPEAKER_07]: You would just have to be pretty,
you know, intentional about giving it
[SPEAKER_07]: enough other, other, um, food to eat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, so wood chips, you know,
a lot of people are doing Hugo culture and
[SPEAKER_07]: wood chips.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that works really, really good for,
um, wood loving psychedelic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's really, really smart
when it comes to, um, cubensis.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to be more of a manure loving
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, a way that a person could utilize
a cubensis run would be to, um,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, make compost and sterilize your
comp, your compost with, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: through turning, um, the compost.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, you know, you'd have to know
mushroom cultivation, but you could
[SPEAKER_07]: inoculate a manure compost and put it on
as a top dress to your plate.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, you know, you could, you know,
you could, you know, you could,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you could grow a bunch of plants
and grow a flush of cubensis with your
[SPEAKER_07]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cubensis really likes super high
humidity and, and flowering cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't necessarily like super high
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are really awesome balance that
you gotta find there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be like, you would want to have
your mushrooms flowering during vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: time and then be done.
[SPEAKER_07]: The best way to do that would be to have
two greenhouses, one on one side,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is a flower, a flushing,
um, mushrooms and then one on the other.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would be pushing CO2 air into the
other greenhouse, which was growing weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would be beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what are some mushrooms,
be it psychedelic or not, that you would
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend people to try to incorporate
into their life and ingest kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: regularly if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the medicinal mushrooms, rishi,
chaga, cordyceps, agaricon, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: turkey tail, uh, lion's mane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nootropic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much damage that's going on
within our brains, within wifi that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to start introducing nootropic
medicine, which is lion's mane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, incorporating a lot of the
different tree polypores, because then it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes all of the intelligence from the
tree and puts it into the polypore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it makes it where you're actually
getting direct tree medicine through the
[SPEAKER_00]: polypore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So allying with mushrooms right now at
this time of earth's toxicity is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then how do you utilize that in,
you know, in what mushrooms do you use in
[SPEAKER_07]: your cannabis grow?
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause a lot of ones she, she mentioned
like chaga is not one that you can grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's, that's a wild mushroom
that only grows on birch trees,
[SPEAKER_07]: but, um, you know, you can inoculate logs
and use that as a, as, as a way of
[SPEAKER_07]: building your beds.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you could have rishi or lion's mane or
maitake logs, making a raised bed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can bury, um, lion's mane logs in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are ways of, of building your
soils with medicinal mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_07]: um, through log spawn.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people can look up log spawn and find
out more about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's, and then also garden giants
like Kelly said, as King's Traferia or
[SPEAKER_07]: Rugoso Anyalata and that really amazing
compost eating mushroom.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really useful in living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, and if you can't grow it,
then find somebody who is growing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in an organic, um, cultivation
because yeah, allying with medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms are really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them, you can't grow,
you know, like lion's mane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that would be difficult to
grow inside of your indoor cultivation of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but you certainly can find it
out in the woods or you can find somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else that's cultivating in it in a
respectful way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, turkey tail is another one you can
grow on the logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like a garakon is, is almost
impossible to get unless you're buying
[SPEAKER_00]: like the mycelium of somebody who is
cultivating the mycelium or rishi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's sometimes finicky
depending on where you're growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, I think we, we think that it's okay
to be sourcing it from other people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing organic medicinal mushrooms as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to spread yourself that thin,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's, I think it's a crucial part
of a really sweet like farm to have
[SPEAKER_07]: mushrooms growing on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I, you know, we're all about,
you know, people taking it on oyster
[SPEAKER_07]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that can be huge, easy thing to
grow on your property.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm probably going to go eat some
after this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is something I've been dying to
ask you guys about for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about the rise of what I
call CBD everything?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, CBD burgers from in and
out and CBD candy from the gas station.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this a positive thing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we have CBD gas we just got for our
car.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The car really loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's great because then more hemp is
being farmed and there's more people
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plant gets to come more out of
her prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: She gets to like make, make more of a
scene, you know, into the world and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more and more people are cultivating
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as more hemp is, is being grown,
more land is being remediated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a huge positive on the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD everything hurrah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that also means that people's
cannabinoid receptors are going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: getting flooded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's wonderful too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's only going to help people
become more healthy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it feels like, you know,
a phase and it feels like something that's
[SPEAKER_07]: fad and it's kind of like, you know,
maybe it makes you roll your eyes in a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit, but it's just kind of a
testimony of just like create rules and
[SPEAKER_07]: everyone's just going to exploit it on,
on all fronts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, really the main teaching is,
you know, to, to think that CBD is like
[SPEAKER_07]: the B all end all compound is really not
true.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, so it's just, it doesn't have THC
in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a non, it's not intoxicant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people can put it in everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, if people was putting a full
spectrum extract in there instead of just
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD, I mean, that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would love to go, I would love to
have it in everything I eat because really
[SPEAKER_07]: we, that's why we have an endocannabinoid
system is for it to be fully saturated,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, and having it in your foods and
smoking it or ways of doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it could be really healthy and
maybe back in evolution hemp was fed to
[SPEAKER_07]: animals and animals ate it and CBD and all
the compounds were in the animal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the people ate the animals.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think that hemp and cannabinoid
were, have been an essential part of our
[SPEAKER_07]: food chain through evolution.
[SPEAKER_07]: So really it's only respectful to our
evolution that we have now CBD products
[SPEAKER_07]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that maybe we should demand
more than just CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do you feel about vape pens?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they a necessary evil?
[SPEAKER_03]: And given they do have, generally
speaking, such a bland cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: profile, how do you think we can go about
getting this, what seems to be like a
[SPEAKER_03]: vital stepping stone between the casual
enthusiasts and the more hardcore fans to
[SPEAKER_03]: incorporate a more holistic profile in it
and really give people these medicinal
[SPEAKER_03]: benefits they're maybe not seeing
otherwise?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, the vape pen is kind of
like the remote control, like for the TV,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, like back when it was just
convenient, you know, it was just,
[SPEAKER_07]: it didn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could still, you know, do whatever you
needed without it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the vape pen is just kind of like
people want to drive around or travel to
[SPEAKER_07]: other countries and have a vape pen.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's like, it's more of like a
lifestyle thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, nowadays, I think the,
the thing that sucks about vape pens is
[SPEAKER_07]: that there's just such a... It's that
they're vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that sucks about vape pens is
that they're vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, so... But they're very
convenient for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what people like.
[SPEAKER_07]: They also have, you know, depending,
a high, so a high quality vape pen would
[SPEAKER_07]: be one that doesn't have weird residues on
it because of where it was manufactured in
[SPEAKER_07]: China.
[SPEAKER_07]: So vape pens can be toxic to the consumer
and also toxic to the environment because
[SPEAKER_07]: they're just disposable.
[SPEAKER_07]: So an ecologically minded person really
doesn't love vape pens.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that would be my answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or make sure that they're refillable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, ones that, because like
Josh said, I think Steep Hill just did a
[SPEAKER_00]: massive study, a blind case study of
shopping and all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that, I don't know the
percentage, but an overwhelming percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: of the vape pens, you know, were just
toxic in and of themselves because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: coil that was heating up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that we can do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I think that, you know,
with these beautiful extracts that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: made from flour, I think that we can do
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, refillable, reusable ones
that have glass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also people are... Maybe a hemp plastic
vape pen.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, let's just hope that
innovation can catch up.
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can get a good, you know,
vaping unit that makes it, there's maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: reasons why vaping makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's less smoke and it's less
carbon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you have a challenged lung,
I mean, I'm not going to demonize
[SPEAKER_07]: anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we can be a non-discriminatory,
non-discriminatory ganja ingesters.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, you know, it's a right place at
the right time.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what did Rome do as a Romans?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you might have to smoke out of a vape
pen.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: Every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, you know, it's not going to be
the natural choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing I wanted to bring up with you
guys before we jump onto some of our fan
[SPEAKER_03]: suggested questions was this idea of the
green Renaissance.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that Julie and the Good Folk over
at Skunk Magazine have been pushing this
[SPEAKER_03]: idea hard and you guys are well on board
with it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of stimulated you to push and
put your backing behind this idea of the
[SPEAKER_03]: green Renaissance?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just think that it's kind of what
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's what's natural.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, like Julia stated, it's,
you know, it's not a rush.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's more of an awakening.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more of a reawakening and a,
you know, something that's more long
[SPEAKER_07]: lasting and it kind of has an essence to
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, it just, it feels good to
think of it as, you know, something that's
[SPEAKER_07]: emerging and, you know, a lot of people
talk about, you know, kids don't want to
[SPEAKER_07]: be farmers anymore in indigenous cultures
and different places in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: But actually a lot of kids do want to be
farmers thanks to weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as the governments don't fuck it
up too much, you know, we might be able
[SPEAKER_07]: to, you know, have a lot of young,
amazing farmers that want to grow,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, because we get people that are
young all the time that be like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the greatest dream on earth
would be to have their own farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I think that, you know, there's just a
lot of ways to look at things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we might slide into some of the fan
suggested questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are in no particular order or rank,
but the first one I've written down,
[SPEAKER_03]: what are some inputs that people can
easily grow for themselves on a small
[SPEAKER_03]: scale that would be beneficial to both
their gardens and possibly even their
[SPEAKER_03]: body?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nettle, comfrey, alfalfa is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut alfalfa so many times in a
year and it just keeps coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with comfrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all really easy things to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edible flowers are really great to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they contain, you know,
terpenes and they're nice for our own
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, lots of different
diversity is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the four that are really
easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyone can do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can grow yarrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's a lot of different
foliar sprays that you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you can grow ginger.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, really, I think that's what you
should grow is as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, how about this?
[SPEAKER_07]: What can you grow?
[SPEAKER_07]: Grow that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because really, it's not just like
choosing one thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's a world out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're on the Internet right there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone lives wherever they live.
[SPEAKER_07]: They could be in São Paulo, Brazil right
now and 20 million people around them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what can they grow?
[SPEAKER_07]: They can just grow simple cover crops and
pots and then just take the cover crop and
[SPEAKER_07]: cut it and make a fermented plant juice
out of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they can water all their plants,
you know, in their house from that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's there's so many things
you can grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's just the explore botany,
you know, understand kinship, gardening
[SPEAKER_07]: and the evolution of plants and just try
and grow as much as if you can grow a
[SPEAKER_07]: moringa tree, that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you could just sit there and cut
the moringa tree back all day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And another thing people can grow is
spirulina.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can grow algaes in an aquarium
in your house.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's something that's really healthy
for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's also good for your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can grow deciduous trees because
leaves are really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf mold is so beautiful for soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that can be collected
every fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it offers great oxygen around your
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing fruit trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you can use fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's yeah, really the sky is the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just what what grows well in your zone and
area that you feel like you can take on
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes it really easy that then will
make you more curious to want to grow more
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's lots of plants with known high
biomass.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those that look for plants that high in
biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spirulina is definitely one that's been on
my radar for a minute now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it ties into this next question of
what is a good place to start in regards
[SPEAKER_03]: to bringing what would be considered a
very nutrient deficient soil back to life?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are some of the ingredients you would
first and foremost be looking to
[SPEAKER_03]: incorporate?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, life.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, you could plant cover crops
on it and turn that in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that would be a really fast,
simple way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to the forest and find some area that
is living and really healthy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can bring that back.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would look maybe to worm castings or
some kind of compost or composted manure
[SPEAKER_07]: or some kind of animal healthy animal
place that's near you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe someone has alpacas or llamas or
something or rabbits and you can get some
[SPEAKER_07]: good pigeons.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can get some pigeon poop and
chickens, something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't want to overdo it with that kind
of stuff because it can be hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you're trying to get quick life
back in there, you know, animal manures
[SPEAKER_07]: when when it's coming from a healthy
sources is a really good way of doing it
[SPEAKER_07]: or worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the most immediate ways that
people in suburban areas is just always
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping nice compost going and having
worms in it so that you always have good,
[SPEAKER_00]: accessible, inoculant, biology soil to put
on top of any of your plants at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just using your kitchen scraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that makes people more
knowledgeable about, hey, maybe I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow organic food because then that's
going into my compost pile, which my worms
[SPEAKER_00]: are eating, which is then going to go into
my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And put Bokashi and Bokashi in your food
scrap.
[SPEAKER_07]: So your food scraps are already
pre-digested when they when they go in the
[SPEAKER_07]: worm farm, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: At one point, you're just playing,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next question I have, I'm honestly
not too sure about the context of.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just hoping you guys kind of
understand it better than what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But someone said, how do you feel about
the flow canner slash other sellouts and
[SPEAKER_03]: how all of the regenerative cannabis
farming award recipients get lumped into
[SPEAKER_03]: this same group?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, to say that the regenerative
farm award winners got lumped into a group
[SPEAKER_07]: is just it's not it's not like it wasn't
premeditated by any means.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was what it was was Flo Khanna was
wanting to work with really intentional
[SPEAKER_07]: conscious farmers in northern California.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you win the farm award,
you just get to be known and people are
[SPEAKER_07]: like, hey, I want to be your product.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I mean, I think it was just,
you know, it was just kind of a natural
[SPEAKER_07]: thing, you know, what the pro I think
here's the I think what the problem is,
[SPEAKER_07]: is that when companies get really,
really huge, they start taking investment
[SPEAKER_07]: from other companies.
[SPEAKER_07]: And with Flo Khanna, they just got really
huge and they took investment from
[SPEAKER_07]: companies that are not in line with
regenerative practices.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it put it's starting.
[SPEAKER_07]: It started to put an ethical question in
with the farmers.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, what they're you know,
what you want them to be doing a good
[SPEAKER_07]: thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: But when they're taking investment from
companies, you know, that are connected to
[SPEAKER_07]: Marlboro or Altria or companies that are
harmful to the earth, you just have to
[SPEAKER_07]: it's really hard to navigate, you know,
that territory.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people are torn.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just say in the community right
now, you know, on on that subject right
[SPEAKER_07]: now because of those because of those
principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it's really important to say that,
you know, there are there are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, new horizons that cannabis
farmers haven't thought about before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when cannabis farmers are
signing contracts, that's why we were
[SPEAKER_00]: saying it's so important to only sign pro
tracks right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because and we can use this as an example,
you know, when when farmers are signing
[SPEAKER_00]: contracts, they weren't necessarily
thinking about, well, geez, this company
[SPEAKER_00]: could sell out to something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then where is my IP and and where is
is is my SOP's, you know, within that or
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is my branding of my own farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just is really giving us the ability
to become more intelligent and more savvy
[SPEAKER_00]: with the corporate cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the more that we see,
you know, what corporate cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is capable of is the more that
we need to come up with smarter
[SPEAKER_00]: alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, with the flow kind of
thing, they have really beautiful farms
[SPEAKER_00]: that are working with them and they have
not changed and how they're cultivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they haven't, you know, they're still
growing regenerative and they're still,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, creating wonderful education
within the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're and everybody is really
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just we're being caught in a
corporate riffraff that as cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers, we are new to and we need to
become more savvy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's similar to what happened with
Phyllis, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they started joining forces with
Syngenta and Monsanto and and Dow
[SPEAKER_07]: Chemicals and all these things.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just when you start getting,
you know, that that much investment,
[SPEAKER_07]: you start having to like what you'd say,
sell your soul, you know, to to the
[SPEAKER_07]: monster.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's why we were just saying,
we want to be independent of that and we
[SPEAKER_07]: don't want to be swallowed by
corporations.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just, you know, it's new.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's new territory.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to be dolphin pods in an ocean of
sharks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great analogy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where do you hope to see the craft
cannabis market in 10 years from now?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do you think Big Ag will factor
into this picture?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I think Big Ag can just folly around
with the idea that they can cultivate
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis in a way that's, you know,
better for people.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's just going to be funny to
watch them, you know, fall on themselves
[SPEAKER_07]: over and over.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it'd be like whatever on that front.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think craft, whether it's, you know,
when someone says the word craft cannabis,
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you would to me, I'm like,
does that mean organic or regenerative?
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not descriptive enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so just because they're small doesn't
necessarily make them good.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it's craft and better, I would hope
that it's regenerative or, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I would use the word regenerative instead
of organic because we want, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, more than organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the future, what I would like to see
is a really huge value for consciously
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivated cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I would like what I I'm assuming that
it's going to be like Safeway or some kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of large supermarket chain selling food
all over the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the farmers market in any town is
always going to have better food.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that there's going to be like
micro brews or more valuable or something
[SPEAKER_07]: like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that, you know, consciously
cultivated small farms that have better
[SPEAKER_07]: strains and a better story.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to see that that be a really well
defined, you know, market to where people
[SPEAKER_07]: are really well educated on what corporate
cannabis looks like and what potentially
[SPEAKER_07]: regenerative craft cannabis looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, it's really
easy to greenwash and it's super easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: greenwash the term craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because they're smaller,
they using the same synthetic nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that big corporate cannabis is using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely needs to be more definitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what we want to see in 10
years from now in the cannabis industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: much more conscious cultivation because
the earth needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need it as it's, you know, as its
consumer and the plant really deserves it
[SPEAKER_00]: for, you know, healing us for,
you know, so many years since the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of humanity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to see processors and really
conscious food companies and which we are
[SPEAKER_07]: seeing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, what we're seeing is the
beginning of conscious commerce.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, a company that wants to make a
cannabis product has to source their
[SPEAKER_07]: products.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they go to source their products and
they come across the pure certification
[SPEAKER_07]: and pure farms, I mean, it's kind of a no
brainer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, of course they want that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would I'm seeing a high value for
consciously cultivated products.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess we can just leave it there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's going to grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It does grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why natural food stores are
growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why the whole movement is growing,
because people want they're tired of being
[SPEAKER_07]: sick.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the system and corporations just are
constantly making us sick everywhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just it's not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why CBD is so popular,
because it all of a sudden is offering an
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giving us a little bit of a gauge on
what's happening with humanity and what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening with society right now is that
people are, you know, feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: disenfranchised and disillusioned from big
pharma and big ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're learning how to do it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And heck, if if it's going to be cannabis
that leads the way, that's going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you know, more knowledge of ways
to do it better, then that's freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot of people are saying,
oh, CBD this, CBD that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's definitely a gauge on what
society is wanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's outside of the pharmaceutical
world right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So given the success of the Dragonfly of
the Dragonfly brand in regards to
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivating sustainable cannabis,
do you have any plans or interests to
[SPEAKER_03]: become involved in, say, larger scale
production of hemp?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we're definitely interested in hemp
production.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, how large can it be is
basically what we're looking at this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, this is a year when
we're deciding whether feminized seed hemp
[SPEAKER_07]: growing is something that we certify.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're deciding on, you know, can there be
a hundred or four hundred acre hemp farm?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, can a four hundred acre hemp
farm be pure, certified or regenerative?
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have that right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they would have to really stand out
and have some kind of really thought out,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, crop rotations or something
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're having those discussions now
really big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within our group as to, you know,
people are saying, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it scalable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's really interesting because we
utilize the term scalable and big ag and
[SPEAKER_00]: is is scalable the way that we've been
doing it successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to understand what is scalable
for regenerative agriculture period,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily what's scalable for
regenerative hemp even, but just what's
[SPEAKER_00]: scalable .
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, what we see in saving the
earth is, you know, a ton of small farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: small farmers are what is going to save
the earth right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that absolutely goes into hemp
farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's big corporate hemp that's going
to come in and they're going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, producing 50 million acres of
hemp, which is what's going on over in
[SPEAKER_00]: China right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they do that regeneratively?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't really believe that
that's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to bring back the small farms but
at the same time, there's a lot of hemp
[SPEAKER_07]: that's overtaking other crops in the
field, which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So large scale hemp farmers might be
taking out a farmer, might be growing that
[SPEAKER_07]: instead of something else, which they
would spray.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, hemp could be, you know,
is going to be something that's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: save, you know, agriculture, I think,
in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, this is related specifically to
your... I'm going to have to clarify this
[SPEAKER_03]: and re-ask the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you pronounce it pagodas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have so many different structures
on our property.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have a couple of structures
that look like a pagoda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Josh is an amazing builder and he
always takes on a project with like
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing creativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, every one of our greenhouses,
you know, that's been hand built by us is
[SPEAKER_00]: just really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a style of its own because we want
to remain creative and keep the juices
[SPEAKER_00]: flowing for us too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're building, you know, 10 of the
same greenhouses, it's sort of boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're always trying to keep style and
beauty involved on our farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that home kind of feel they must
all have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, just in regards to the various
types of structures you guys have,
[SPEAKER_03]: how does it compare having one on,
say, a hillside versus on a flat surface?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, does the gradient change the
dynamics of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And specifically, this person wanted to
know, is airflow problematic when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: on the side of the hill?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, for us, we have a really beautiful
airflow that comes through off our lake.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, a hill is really nice to have
because it creates natural airflow.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the morning, the heat is rising in our
valley and the air is always going up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the evening, it's going down
because the air is cooling off.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we get a lot of really good,
you know, airflow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I prefer to have a slope to grow on
really because if you have a water source
[SPEAKER_07]: above you, then you can gravity feed
everything down.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of, you know, it's a natural
way of collecting.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you can create different zones
and environments really easy by terracing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, by going to Asia, you know,
all these years and even Guatemala and
[SPEAKER_07]: Central America, terracing, you know,
is something that really just caught our
[SPEAKER_07]: eye.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're just like, oh, my God, terracing is
so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, we've made really big terraces on
our land.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what it does is just naturally makes
an environment and then each environment
[SPEAKER_07]: can grow kind of a different thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, a flat surface is hard to work with.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's a lot more exposed.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to, you know, really use trees,
I think, a lot more for flat surfaces to
[SPEAKER_07]: create environments and food forests and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, our slope, you know, helps us out a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we build our greenhouses to have a
flow through design for air.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we don't have any fans in any of our
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the way that we utilize them is more
of like a roof or an area to where there's
[SPEAKER_07]: a flow through design.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there's no stagnant energy anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, we've kind of touched on this before,
but it's a bit of a specific question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'll throw it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll get a specific answer to this
specific question.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you were to get a plant from
whatever source it may be, a friend,
[SPEAKER_03]: just maybe it's just had a bit of an
unlucky run with things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's just say it's really quite sick
and it's not doing too well.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be your protocol for getting
this out of that heavy shocked state and
[SPEAKER_03]: back up and alive and boosted?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, separate it from the rest of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing that you want to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people feel like, oh, well,
I'll just bring it in with my other plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and into my environment where my other
plants are healthy because pathogens are
[SPEAKER_00]: so prevalent right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them you can't see with a
naked eye, like say a broad mite and a
[SPEAKER_00]: russet is even hard to see, even though
you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But isolating it and then just putting it
in a really beautiful soil immediately and
[SPEAKER_00]: just giving it teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always feel like earthworm casting tea
is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name is chicken soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to bring a plant back to life,
just feed it earthworm casting tea because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absorbable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has all of the nutrients and it's
really basic and easy for a plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake because just like when we get sick,
it's difficult for us to uptake things
[SPEAKER_00]: because our immune response is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our microbiology is low.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, things are not responding so
easily.
[SPEAKER_07]: Add a lot of biology and if you can have
it outside and have it get rained on or,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, if you can, you know,
use the natural elements to your
[SPEAKER_07]: advantage, depending on time of year and
everything like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: you have to be smart about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, if you can bring it outside
and, you know, have the natural elements
[SPEAKER_07]: on it, that's really smart too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is an odd one, but hopefully
you're going to have some perspective on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any thoughts on how Vermont
was the first state to legalize cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: via state legislation as opposed to a
referendum?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think it should have happened
by a referendum?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think any way that it can become
legalized is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just so happened that in Vermont,
it became legalized through more political
[SPEAKER_00]: power rather than people power.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I think shows the maturity.
[SPEAKER_07]: That shows how it's matured too.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Oregon also just through state
legislature just legally is the export of
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis to other states.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not legal to export to other
states, but within the state of Oregon,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what they're saying is, you know,
this is, we're ready for this law when it
[SPEAKER_07]: changes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that it's always going to be
better, you know, for long-term,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, to not have systems change and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's a vote by the people, then you're
basically still against the legislature.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if the legislature makes the decision,
then you may not like their decision,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it's going to be more stable,
I think, for the states.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what we think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So another specific one, but probably
going to be more easier to answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: This fan wants to know, do you view
comfrey as better to use during a
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetative phase, during a flowering
phase, or it's equally good for both?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's equally good for both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains a vast amount of different
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a comfrey patch,
you know, feed your comfrey patch with
[SPEAKER_00]: good teas and stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can uptake good nutrients,
but it's so well-balanced that you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: it during, you know, from the very
beginning stages of a seedling all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: up until your last days of flower almost.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the roots are good on wind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what would be your go-to source for
organic boron?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a trace element that's
commonly mentioned as lacking in soils,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's also quite difficult for many
people to come across.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have an exact source of natural
boron other than just creating really good
[SPEAKER_07]: compost, you know, from diverse sources
and, you know, getting your boron from
[SPEAKER_07]: naturally, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're really concerned about any
type of mineral deficiency within your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or in your soil, then it's always
better to have it come from a plant source
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than a whole mineral source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a tremendous amount of time for a
mineral to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a go-between plant,
like say that, you know, borage actually
[SPEAKER_00]: is a good boron plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add like a tremendous amount of
that to it and then use that plant in a
[SPEAKER_00]: ferment or chop it up to put it into a
soil because then that's going to become,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, equal or very easily absorbable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just plants understand plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whenever you're utilizing a plant
source as your main mineral source,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just easier for the plant to digest
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier for the microbiology to break
it down instantly and it becomes readily
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what kind of resource sources and
approaches would you recommend we look
[SPEAKER_03]: into using to help educate our politicians
and should we be pushing for exclusively
[SPEAKER_03]: legislation that's designed to help care
for the earth at the same time as allowing
[SPEAKER_03]: production or is simply a foot in the door
approach good enough initially?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I think ultimately we're,
you know, looking for a full package and
[SPEAKER_07]: there really are a lot of really good
examples of companies that have been able
[SPEAKER_07]: to to provide that, you know, so there's I
don't know of a piece of literature that
[SPEAKER_07]: you could point, you know, politicians to
that would say, you know, this is a,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, reason why you should legalize.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think that there is a lot of
activists out there and people that have
[SPEAKER_07]: really, you know, made differences in
their local jurisdictions and they're,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, they're moving around the
country and there's a lot of lawyers that
[SPEAKER_07]: have become more and more savvy to what
works.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's just part of the
conferences are also, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: connecting people with lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think lawmakers are actually looking for
people to communicate with in the
[SPEAKER_07]: community.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think if you make yourself a little
bit more available, then you will be able
[SPEAKER_07]: to help change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that any time that we're
talking about agriculture, we need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about health and well-being of the
earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reason why we have tremendous
illness on the planet is because those two
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations didn't go together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided that plants and agriculture
should be more involved in science rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really missed the mark there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hence we have tremendously sick
waterways and soil systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're not having conversations as
we move into the future, when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing agriculture about ecology and
about healthy water and earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we were not doing our job.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, the whole entire cannabis
industry, as we know, it started out as a
[SPEAKER_07]: medical, you know, gift to ailments,
you know, that whether it was AIDS in San
[SPEAKER_07]: Francisco or, you know, that was the
epicenter of legalization was stemmed from
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so usually a place becomes medical
first and then it becomes recreational
[SPEAKER_07]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is because then the whole medical
aspect, it gets kind of thrown away
[SPEAKER_07]: because recreational is kind of just a big
tax bracket thing where everyone can get
[SPEAKER_07]: paid.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you kind of forgot that it was a
medicinal thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's the same thing with
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you'd almost be missing out to
just say, oh, well, let's just legalize
[SPEAKER_07]: weed and just forget about how it grows.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think that we should consider,
hey, well, this is a medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it should be cultivated like a
medicine, which is medicinally good for
[SPEAKER_07]: the earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for us, you know, we're just going to
go for the full home run or the,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're just going to say, I think we
should have it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the time is now where this is no
time to skimp.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should ask for everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should have all of it,
a healthy environment and legalization,
[SPEAKER_07]: all of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's medical access, you know,
in Canada, it's legal, but we've lost
[SPEAKER_07]: access really.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's less products available to
the consumer now through legalization than
[SPEAKER_07]: there was before.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's lame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this one's a bit of an odd one when I
first read it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, you know, there's a place for
everything, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you feel about sprinkling the
ashes of a loved one into the soil and
[SPEAKER_03]: growing a plant from it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I think that's a kind of a
no brainer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's not a good term to use,
but I think that's my mother is in our
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think that's just, you know,
sanctifying the ashes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, for one, ashes are good for soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're good there and you're able to
transform the energy and put it into a
[SPEAKER_07]: plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe you have a placenta,
too, and you put it underneath a tree.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: You could you could go on and on and on as
the cycle of life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we think it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of our dogs are underneath our
cannabis plants, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We felt like that was just super
respectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not grow a beautiful medicine,
you know, over some something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: loved, you know, that soul and spirit is
not still there, but that body is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a wonderful way to respect the
body that walked this planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So someone wanted to know, do you guys
offer tours of your farm at all to the
[SPEAKER_03]: public, specifically those who are quite
interested in joining the pure family?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we do not because we're really
far away and we just don't have the setup
[SPEAKER_07]: to be touring people around.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then and if we the time to as much as
I would love to, I think it would be
[SPEAKER_07]: healing to, you know, people to be able to
come to our farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think one day we would love to do
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're just not set up for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a way, that's kind of cannabis tourism
or it's like eco tourism.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that is a thing that could be
really beautiful for farms.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know a lot of farms in California
and different places are embracing that
[SPEAKER_07]: and bringing people to their farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they could be super smart.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that we just don't do it right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have lots of farmer friends and
people that are in the industry that will
[SPEAKER_00]: come here to get a little bit of
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we know that they're going to
pass that on or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been open to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, the truth is we are we are so
far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing but like us out here.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like our own spiritual temple
retreat, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we just kind of get rejuvenated
by being on our land.
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes that's what we need because
we have, you know, a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cannabis packaging and branding has
become a focal highlight of discussion in
[SPEAKER_03]: recent weeks, most notably anyone who's
ever shopped at a dispenser who probably
[SPEAKER_03]: has a myriad of containers that are just
starting to accumulate after only ever
[SPEAKER_03]: having a few grams in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: What type of packaging do you want to see
going forward?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's a sad reality to,
you know, there's so there's millions of
[SPEAKER_07]: pounds of garbage, you know, based just on
dube tubes, you know, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: like amazing, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Sana packaging is one new company that
is making really conscious packaging that
[SPEAKER_07]: is hemp plastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also they use recycled ocean plastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is still plastic in a way.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it's hemp plastic, then that's just
awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: When it comes to biodegradable material,
the only thing about biodegradable is it
[SPEAKER_07]: might be GMO biodegradable, and you'd have
to be careful of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that algae, there's algae
plastics that are coming out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's also something that's of
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, and also we package all of our
products in glass because we feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's important to also have a reusable
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not just something that's recyclable,
something that people can also reuse.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's a thing too, because I
don't I don't in Canada, I think,
[SPEAKER_07]: for example, I think you can only use if
you're a licensed producer, I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: sure it's like you can only use their
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really weird black plastic that
they just like did some studies on a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of months ago and they left it out
into the sunshine and realized that it off
[SPEAKER_00]: gassed like a tremendous amount of toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, well, that's not very
creative nor ecological.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's unfortunate because Canadians are
really upset about it, as well as a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: producers are feeling like, wow,
I've grown this beautiful flower and I got
[SPEAKER_00]: to put it into a weird plastic container
that's going to fill up all of the and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic that they're putting in and it's
not even recyclable in Canada.
[SPEAKER_07]: So people could grow their own weed and
then they wouldn't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_07]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one thing that would help.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's definitely it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think that there has likewise
become too much of a focus on the
[SPEAKER_03]: aesthetics of packaging?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like is having a fancy packaging like a
legitimate reason or claim to charge more
[SPEAKER_03]: for the exact same product?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I think it's kind of a
bummer to make you bring your packaging
[SPEAKER_07]: into your pricing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of like how it's unavoidable.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you can't really do anything about
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that, you know, cannabis
packaging, God, it's just it's a thing
[SPEAKER_07]: that you can't really I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know what to say about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an unnecessary evil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like there's there's always going to
be people who want to package their
[SPEAKER_03]: product more fancy and more shiny and
flashy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then, you know, yet to have these
rampant markups is just a bit of a
[SPEAKER_03]: different realm as far as I can see.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's partly standing out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, if you have your own
equipment or your own packaging,
[SPEAKER_07]: that you've designed yourself,
it can help you stand out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And at the end of the day, standing out
matters.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, if someone loves their
packaging and it's awesome and it's just
[SPEAKER_07]: sitting out on the counter all day and
they're like, oh, check out this product.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it helps.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, if you have to make sales,
you know, might as well be crafty about it
[SPEAKER_07]: and make something good.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, don't go nuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: And create something that's, you know,
it costs too expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything is already too expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we are down to our last of the
fan submitted questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I left it to last for a reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you guys feel about cookies in
general?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, it has like the Keebler
kind.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, it's all about the hype.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think it's a flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, it's do you like the
flavors?
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, you know, I think that a lot
of people like the flavor and that's why
[SPEAKER_07]: it sells.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think that people like wedding cake
now, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, now it's just cakes and
cobblers and cookies and, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, gelatos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, oh, my God, you know, and the Mac and
that is just like whatever is the new
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised there's not a Mac and cheese
yet.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm just waiting for that one to
come out because that's probably going to
[SPEAKER_07]: be pretty sweet, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, I it's a flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm not going to I like weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I'll smoke cookies.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not and I'll be happily do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm personally not into that
terpene profile of the cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a midwife for a long time, I can smell
like cookies from, you know, 100 other
[SPEAKER_00]: different bags because it reminds me of
breastfed baby poop is what it smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, you know, an interesting
smell, but it's not really a terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile that, you know, draws me.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's so many flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, tons of people love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of a lot of good points in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to quickly mention, I think that our
old Capulator has made a mac and cheese
[SPEAKER_03]: strain, cross-macked cheese.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: See, if someone's thought about it,
someone's already done it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the rules of the Internet,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on to our final kind of little quick
fire questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one, I wanted to quickly ask you,
what type of genetics would you like to
[SPEAKER_01]: see make a comeback?
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to see, um, God, ones that
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I really love the alcapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say bring it back big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just, you know, as much as the
original alcapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is like different strains that
people are calling alcapulco gold,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not really the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff when that was going around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think that just, you know,
non-feminized stable bred, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: smart strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's what I like to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you could offer one or maybe even
two tips on selecting a male to our
[SPEAKER_03]: listeners, what would they be?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well.
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be really nice to have a male
that is strong and comes up, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and grows faster.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think is a good is a good trait because
it shows, you know, that it's vigorous and
[SPEAKER_07]: and of course, you know, rubbing the stem
does help you get smells from the male.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that you should know what
you're looking for in a male because
[SPEAKER_07]: sometimes there's colors in the leaf or in
the stock that show up really early on in
[SPEAKER_07]: life.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it can kind of tell you a little bit
about what's happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: Later in life, you'd want to look at the
leaf structure.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you like the node height that that that
it's growing, maybe it's short,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe it's reaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly we choose our males like to be
really manly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we like our males to be really strong
and and maybe it fly, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe it came to its flowers early.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's an early, you know, it's more it's
not late flowering.
[SPEAKER_07]: You would want to look for something that
progressed faster.
[SPEAKER_07]: And sometimes with these, you'll sometimes
get trichomes on the males and that can,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, signal that it's going to be,
you know, more oil rich and oil
[SPEAKER_07]: productive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, red stocks or red stems can
be something that you look for.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I think it's really it's
depending on what it says.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a it's a varied one, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's really strain specific.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you were, you know,
breeding land race, you would look for the
[SPEAKER_07]: thinnest leaf that you can see,
you know, something like that or,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, maybe a fat leafed hash strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I mean, there's a lot of it's I
love that it's endless.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fractal medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our next one.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is one strain that you just never
particularly vibed with?
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, definitely Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't, you know, sort of that
like traditional like what people call
[SPEAKER_00]: like a Kush flavor, which is like really
high and like a humaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something that I necessarily
vibe with.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, I really never met an Anja plant
that I didn't love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just a terpene profile for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would agree with Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember I asked you that last interview
and you gave a similar answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were saying, you know, I pretty much
like them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consistency.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is one strain that maybe you
tried, maybe you had the cutting,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's now gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's now either out of existence or simply
just out of your hands that you would like
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to get back if possible.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do really like the Jack Herrera clone
that we had for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we had such a beautiful cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, just one of the original from the
Jack Herrera family.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and there was this the White Witch,
which was from the early 90s and the early
[SPEAKER_07]: Trinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Trinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in 1989 and 90.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just super dank, like crazy
crystals and just had amazing flavor and
[SPEAKER_07]: it was so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, and the list goes on and
on because we grow a thousand plants on
[SPEAKER_07]: our property and, you know, we don't
really clone them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they could have all been amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a black a black or almost blue
grateful breath cherry puff.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a real amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I really hope that we get a good we
have some seeds of it and we're growing it
[SPEAKER_07]: again this year.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that would have been another good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think I remember even being able
to sample that one on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was nice, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think one of the things which stand
out in my memory was that you would never
[SPEAKER_03]: have been able to guess that that was
outdoor grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked just as good as anything you'd
ever seen indoor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blessed be.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on to our final question for this chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your ultimate goal slash hope for
the overall trajectory of our little
[SPEAKER_03]: community?
[SPEAKER_07]: My overall hope is that all of the
intentional amazing farmers can continue
[SPEAKER_07]: to stay in business and make amazing
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrive in business.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like that to thrive.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really want to not get it feels like
you're getting penalized for making
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, when you're getting all
these crazy prohibitive licensing and all
[SPEAKER_07]: this stuff, it just feels like you're
almost getting punished for like creating
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would like to live in a world where
it's not like, can you get a license is
[SPEAKER_07]: it's once you have a license, it's how
good can your medicine be?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would love to see small farms being
able to make really, really intentional
[SPEAKER_07]: products and being able to sell it
anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love to be able to sell our
products to any country in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that anyone should be able to
have access to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it should be really fun rather
than funky, you know, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: what it is right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to see a world where we have
these really beautiful, diverse gardens
[SPEAKER_07]: for growing amazing plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's just simply a matter of our
ingenuity to make really good products.
[SPEAKER_07]: To be able to sell and that would be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I mean, just one last,
you know, statement on that is that I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: really like to see all of the people that
are incarcerated for cannabis to be let
[SPEAKER_00]: out because it is really not cool in so
many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really light language that I'm
using that people who are in corporations
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing it legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people who are incarcerated were doing
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to see all cannabis
incarcerated people let out.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would be nice if they raised the
hemp THC counts to make a Delta 9 instead
[SPEAKER_07]: of total THC counts.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we could have better medicine
availability to the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be nice too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that cannabis can change the
world through teaching us so many things
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed to seed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's great that Denver
decriminalized psychedelic much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really cool too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really like nice people too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully our community can continue to
expand and we can create together and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can be communicating and we can be
collaborative in our efforts and moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can protect our own seeds by putting
them into public domain to where we all
[SPEAKER_00]: can use them, to where we can all
actualize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could go on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all fantastic suggestions and
ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess to wrap it up, do you guys have
any comments or shout outs you'd like to
[SPEAKER_03]: make?
[SPEAKER_07]: The shout out we would like to make is to
the earth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big shout out to the earth for providing
us a place to live and the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_07]: speak together.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is an amazing opportunity to be
able to share some of the things that
[SPEAKER_07]: we're interested in.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd like to shout out the pure collective
and the pure certification and just all
[SPEAKER_07]: regenerative farmers and all seed breeders
and people that are making a difference in
[SPEAKER_07]: the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And shout out to people that are able to
resist the corporate takeover that's
[SPEAKER_07]: happening and shout out to seed breeders
and shout out to all of the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are still cultivating cannabis and in a
legal situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're with your brothers and sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for continuing to grow the
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smoke weed every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smoke weed every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a brilliant way to end it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you so much, Josh and Kelly,
