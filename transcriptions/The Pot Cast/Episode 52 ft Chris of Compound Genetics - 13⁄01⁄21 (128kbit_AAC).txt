[SPEAKER_02]: On this episode, we are grateful to be
joined by Chris of Compound Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here to give us the low down on all of the
newest compound crosses, the Runts CoLab,
[SPEAKER_01]: the hype industry, rappers and so much
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, so a big, big thank you and
welcome to the man behind all the
[SPEAKER_02]: mouthwatering creations we see over at the
Compound Genetics Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris, thank you so much for joining us
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for having me here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first question we like to ask
people, what are you currently smoking on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, a wide variety of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have some apples and bananas,
some Baby Yoda, some Arrowhead,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is thinned in by Clayford Kushmer,
the menthol.
[SPEAKER_05]: I also have some jokers, which is white
runts by Jett Fitzgelato, some grape
[SPEAKER_05]: gasoline, some laughing gas, some blue
sushi and some bubbles of gum,
[SPEAKER_05]: Skittles rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and some Fatsir rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a wide variety of flavours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pretty much just mentioned every
strain I wanted to talk about in this
[SPEAKER_02]: interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you so much for giving me a
perfect segue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one that I'll just quickly jump
into first, I think you said blue sushi or
[SPEAKER_02]: sushi.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that one like?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, blue sushi.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from the Tenko.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Skittles cross, I believe,
or a sushi cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from the Tenko.
[SPEAKER_05]: They do an excellent job at LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always, it's probably a silly
question, but I've always wanted,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've never had sushi or any of the
crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it actually taste like some sort of
sushi?
[SPEAKER_05]: A little bit, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Use your imagination, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has the uterus, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, in general, would you classify
yourself as someone who kind of gravitates
[SPEAKER_02]: more towards like the flavour profile of
strains, or are you more about the feeling
[SPEAKER_02]: of it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely turps are important to me,
turps for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel like, I've always had this
opinion that it's always a bit of a bummer
[SPEAKER_02]: when you smell a strain, it smells so
good, and then it just doesn't quite
[SPEAKER_02]: translate to flavour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you of the same mindset, or you think
like good turps?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turps are very important to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to be spot on, and I hate the
names that don't apply.
[SPEAKER_05]: It all messes up, I think, the whole
experience, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always think like, yeah, like when you
get a strain that tastes as it smells,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just kind of elevates the strain to the
next level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely, I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: The full package, it checks all the boxes,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, before we get too deep into
the breeding questions, I'd love to just
[SPEAKER_02]: ask, do you think there's anything you can
do as a breeder to try to help make the
[SPEAKER_02]: strain do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you think it's just the parent
selection, or?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think testing and using the right
cultures to deal with is very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having the right selection to start with.
[SPEAKER_05]: That are true to the name, true turps,
and making sure the breeding is proper to
[SPEAKER_05]: deal with the testing and make sure it
translates into the final product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah, testing's got to be the
foundation of any breeding project.
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty, well, what an awesome little
line up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to quickly jump back to one
other strain you mentioned in the intro,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'd never heard of it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you said arrowhead?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a new one I'm working with,
Burner and Cleefa.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's from the new Wiz Cleefa menu.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a Cleefa Kush by the Thin Moon,
by Menthol.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to cure it with Burner from the
Kukis line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a powerhouse combo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that mean that it's kind of similar
to the Cleefa mints, but there's also Thin
[SPEAKER_02]: Mints mixed in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's more of a Kukis than the actual
OG Cleefa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the question in terms of the
Cleefa stuff that I've been wondering the
[SPEAKER_02]: most about when I first saw all of this
was like, how did all of this come about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you reach out to him?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he reach out to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it all happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole Cleefa collaboration?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I mean, what a cool little
synchronous sort of event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was specifically wondering, did you try
the Cleefa OG and you liked it,
[SPEAKER_02]: or did he have that and kind of brought
that to the table?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how did that part work?
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's like a cool sentiment to hear
because you don't hear about a lot of new
[SPEAKER_02]: OG cuts coming out that people think are
cool and like kind of different to the
[SPEAKER_02]: others.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that you work with a lot of
different OG cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's probably one of your
more preferred ones?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not exactly sure about the background,
but it's definitely a unique OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: It reminds me of like a Triangle SFV
hybrid a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has the gas in both of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really strong and bigger and strong
in track and coverage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, really heavy OG for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stronger than gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big fan of the Triangle and the SFV,
so that sounds like it's ticking boxes
[SPEAKER_02]: already.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my next question would be is,
do you think that the PK is probably the
[SPEAKER_02]: origin of a lot of OGs, or do you think
they just kind of appeared differently?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really sure on the history of OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to dabble on that because
there's some real aficionados on that
[SPEAKER_05]: subject.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just know the Triangle is one of the
standouts from the west coast and has been
[SPEAKER_05]: staple in the community for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess as a final little question on
OG before we jump to the next topic was,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you prefer the really gassy OGs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like kind of like, you know, your high
octanes and stuff like that, or do you
[SPEAKER_02]: prefer the more cushy ones like the TK?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the gassy ones for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are my favorites.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gassy fuel is what I'm all about.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gassy OG is staple, I think,
and my favorite for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't deny it's staple in the
community for a long time to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I kind of realized that myself
when I was talking to Koma a while back
[SPEAKER_02]: and he said, you know, everyone's trying
to reinvent the wheel, but there's so much
[SPEAKER_02]: more work to be done within the gas field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as you said, it's just like,
such a dominating flavor profile that
[SPEAKER_02]: people just fall in love with,
don't they?
[SPEAKER_05]: It never gets old.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always a staple.
[SPEAKER_05]: It comes and goes.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's always there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You never go wrong with gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: It always sells.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a hit and people always love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's jump back to the start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you be able to tell me a little bit
about the first experience you ever had
[SPEAKER_02]: with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: The first experience I had with cannabis
was in high school, I think, or my
[SPEAKER_05]: freshman year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had some friends that were going
downtown to this festival to smoke bowls.
[SPEAKER_05]: They said, I wasn't sure what that meant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to do the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like smoking bowls and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: We took the bus downtown and there was a
drum circle down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like an open vendering market
called bands and music and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was smoking weed and they were
like, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I smoked some weed the first time there
and it was so high and it kind of fell low
[SPEAKER_05]: from that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what a cool story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you happen to know what you were
smoking on or was it just kind of like the
[SPEAKER_02]: reggae or?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was just some high grade Oregon indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: No names at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was the green chronic, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day it was the staple green
bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, I'm jealous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess it's maybe a bit of a
redundant question, but you obviously got
[SPEAKER_02]: high the first time you smoked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, very high.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was floating on water basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the moment when you kind of
started to think maybe you were going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be involved in cannabis throughout your
life or that happened a bit later down the
[SPEAKER_02]: track?
[SPEAKER_05]: That happened a bit later.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was definitely fascinated with cannabis
from a young age and my teenage years.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of pursued it and kept it on my
radar for a long time, but I didn't really
[SPEAKER_05]: make a career until later down the path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and so what was the transition
from say around that time to when you
[SPEAKER_02]: first started to have your first grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it a long time, short time?
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2004, I had the opportunity to go to
Amsterdam with a friend over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went over to Europe for two years and
I really studied the coffee shop culture
[SPEAKER_05]: and really got absorbed in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, I learned a lot about the
marijuana and how it worked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how it affected me in my life and what
I really appreciated about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I came back to Oregon in 2006 and
it was around the time I met a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got a basement with a friend in his
house.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of started growing up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I progressed from that to moving into
other houses and managing more facilities
[SPEAKER_05]: and started working with the sensors and
kind of working from that point on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of really dug into it when I got
back from Amsterdam and made my passion
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of interesting how that seems to
be like a common thread for a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they have that epiphany in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there any genetics you remember from
that time that you were working with that
[SPEAKER_02]: you were like, man, that was like a cool
thing to start out working with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in retrospect, it was like this
legendary strain from Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_02]: or was it just more kind of whatever you
could get your hands on?
[SPEAKER_05]: When I started back in the States,
I was over here with basically basics of
[SPEAKER_05]: like Shishkeberry and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them I've heard from the time
where Pacific North was dog shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fort Collins coughs and really heavy
satuas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Head stompers I really fell in love with.
[SPEAKER_05]: The East Coast Saturdays were all some of
my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed when I was looking at a lot of
your work that like the dog shit popped up
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think I even saw the cough in there
once or twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had only ever really seen Fletcher
from Archive try to like push these
[SPEAKER_02]: strains in terms of saying to people like,
look, these are great strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to give them a chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like you're trying to do the
same in a certain sense of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: get the word out that these are still
killer crosses?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Fletcher's the champion of that
for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I've prepared for that all day long.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm more focused on the modern market with
compound, but those are definitely staples
[SPEAKER_05]: that are kind of lost as well as not
really recognized with today's modern
[SPEAKER_05]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, just out of a personal
curiosity, I've never tried the dog shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like a well-grown,
you know, kind of bud from dog shit would
[SPEAKER_02]: still be pretty enjoyable for most people
these days or it's a bit of like- Oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Problem with that is it goes 12 to 13
weeks in flower, so no one knows the
[SPEAKER_05]: flower properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So kind of lost the attention it deserves.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's definitely a hit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the name kind of holds it back,
but besides that, I think it's a great
[SPEAKER_05]: all-around cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have heard from some other
guests before that they thought the name
[SPEAKER_02]: might've put some people off, but that's
good to hear that it's still power.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea it was a 13-week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you happen to know the genetics on it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, I don't, I don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really strong head high though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess as a general question,
do you find yourself gravitating to sativa
[SPEAKER_02]: strains often or more of like a kush guy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had a question about that,
which was that we see a lot of various
[SPEAKER_02]: different strains being labeled as
exotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that a lot of the time it kind
of boils down to this cookies or kush kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever think we'll see sativa exotics
hitting the stores?
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope the market expands too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it could be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just has to be more bringing the
cultivation time down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's probably sativa and the lack
of barrel peel sometimes, but you can
[SPEAKER_05]: hybridize that with some of the modern for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a kind of a question that I still
don't know much about myself because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just hard to answer, but in your mind,
what makes something exotic?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely think that if you look at
your profile and look deep for exotics in
[SPEAKER_05]: this market, I think people will focus on
that before they actually look at your
[SPEAKER_05]: profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think purple is king in California right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can't really sell any of it or
have any relevance in the market if it's
[SPEAKER_05]: not purple.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's interesting how the market has
changed that and kind of shunned away most
[SPEAKER_05]: green, but as far as like being top shelf
and being popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that all checks out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And would you ever consider like some cool
old world genetics exotic or it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: about like how available it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more about like the aesthetic and the
look and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Old world culture is definitely exotic and
very rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just a matter of your
perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the modern market kind of
pigeonholes certain things.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bigger picture in the wider
world of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's go back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that you started out doing
smaller grows and then as the they
[SPEAKER_02]: succeeded, you're progressing to bigger
and bigger as time went by.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of a grow style do you tend to
use and where you're using back then?
[SPEAKER_05]: Mainly soil-less grows in like cocoa or
pea at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just doing drain away is pretty basic
introduction to grow style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel like the sort of synthetic
or soil-less style of growing has come a
[SPEAKER_02]: long way since then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it's more just people
learning about how to do it better?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people have learned how to do it
better for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really similar, but you can't really
reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only so much you can improve on.
[SPEAKER_05]: For us, it's technology and innovation,
but I think it's definitely the growers
[SPEAKER_05]: have gotten a lot better as opposed to the
earlier era of like medical days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the age-old debate, which commonly
occurs on the show, do you feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: really well-grown soil-less can stand up
to really well-grown soil?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, to a degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they definitely have their own
attributes and traits that are different
[SPEAKER_05]: from each other, but I definitely think
they can be comparable if grown well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I'm asking you this because I
know that you're so tied in with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: these companies and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know of any companies that are
selling maybe recweed or large-scale stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that aren't doing it with soil,
or you think like soil-less is pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: the way to go?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know anyone that's grown with soil
at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as recweed, it's all.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as I can tell in cocoa and
rockwell, it seems to be the trend right
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know of anyone doing something in
soil or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Except Prefcultivore and Organize doing
that too on a large scale.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think that's because of just
like pests and crop value, or do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just ease of use?
[SPEAKER_05]: A mixture of both, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure that's what makes that
happen, but it's definitely not the
[SPEAKER_05]: reality at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess final question on that sort of
like idea is, do you see anyone doing like
[SPEAKER_02]: a sort of a hybrid system where maybe
they're growing in cocoa, but trying to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it kind of with organic inputs otherwise?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there's any merit in that,
or you think like just try to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: properly soil-less?
[SPEAKER_05]: In my experience, you can get more robust
turps inside if you use teas and
[SPEAKER_05]: additives, not just one basic salt thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people are conscious to implement
more things into their grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully they do though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because yeah, people get more on game with
their turps and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we jump back now, you were kind of
developing as a grower and you're moving
[SPEAKER_02]: into bigger and bigger facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: During this time, was there anyone who you
kind of looked up to like often we hear
[SPEAKER_02]: people talking about, you know,
having read some of the earlier books,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, Sensemia tips,
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there anyone you looked up to or you
were kind of discovering things on your
[SPEAKER_02]: own?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking up to, and if I say I used to
snag a lot back in the day, I wrote from a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot, kind of a study that is not in the
knowledge race.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the earlier brewers I looked up to were
probably exactly like Mike.
[SPEAKER_05]: He was definitely the first real brewers I
looked up to that had a really well robust
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial brand that was really put
together and really dialed with his
[SPEAKER_05]: presentation and his quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was in Northwest too, so he was a
good influence for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot he was around that area as well
at the time, wasn't he?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he was in Washington, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hear a lot of people talk about how
Mike had a kind of influence on them like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of cool credence to
the company because I think in some
[SPEAKER_02]: people's mind, they still think of Exotic
as a rather new brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you pointed out, like they've been
around a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, since 2014, I believe.
[SPEAKER_05]: 2013 around there is where I first caught
one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: From that point, kind of when you're
upscaling and growing and growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: at what point did you first have the idea
about Compound?
[SPEAKER_05]: Compound came about around 2016 to 2017,
later into my actual cultivation phase
[SPEAKER_05]: more as a progression of my understanding
the value of genetics and seeing when to
[SPEAKER_05]: do my own stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, how long did it take you to get
the working pieces in place from the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment you first started thinking about it
to actually getting it going?
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, surprisingly, pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I sourced some seeds for the first regular
line that I found the mail from at Chalice
[SPEAKER_05]: Festival in 2016.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the first quarter was for the Femline,
the Jet Fuel Gelato that I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a very fortunate situation where they
will require so much of each genetics
[SPEAKER_05]: initially to start the brand new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's interesting because I
remember the first time I saw your stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: was the Jet Fuel Gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I must have seen it kind of not
too long after things first started out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remembered thinking to myself like,
this looks like a really sort of fire
[SPEAKER_02]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the crosses you made with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remembered looking into the genetics
and the thing which caught me was that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of like an interesting mixture
of genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like the 303 seeds, there's the
high-octane OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it about those specific genetics
that you were into?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you grow 303 before that or you liked
the overall picture it was putting forth?
[SPEAKER_05]: The cultivar was mainly gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: I found it was really a unique gassy
gelato that I liked.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had really good structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I gravitated towards it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I received the cultivar from my friend in
Crayon City, Cannabis and SF who developed
[SPEAKER_05]: the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I helped name it and I originally got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called Jet Lado.
[SPEAKER_05]: I changed it and named it Jet Fuel Gelato
with his permission.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of really put that cultivar
into the spotlight using it in my building
[SPEAKER_05]: projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that a lot of people probably
missed out on some of those initial drops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you the type of breeder who likes to
remake the sort of popular crosses or are
[SPEAKER_02]: you kind of like, now I make them once and
once they're gone, that's it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to make them once when they're
gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're gone usually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Scarcity makes things rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the cultivar has a unique ability to
have a unique cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to be watered down and
really sold and resold over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, are you aware of any of the
Jet Fuel lines still being in stock or
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just long gone at this point?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're pretty much out right away once
they're gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you know, hanging on to a
prayer.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's still some sitting around in the
archive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I noticed from there, actually,
sorry, rewind a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I mistaken in that I think that when
Compound started, it was a collaboration
[SPEAKER_02]: between you and another breeder,
was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it usually was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when did you kind of go your own way
with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: In the summer of 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And was that just sort of like you wanted
to take control of the direction you were
[SPEAKER_02]: heading in?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was kind of unfortunate
circumstances that happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of a fly-out between us, me and my
partner at the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was no one reason for it
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would I be correct in that the menthol was
made before the separation?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it was made at the same time as the
Jet Fuel Gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to put this all together
because I noticed that Weist Farms also
[SPEAKER_02]: uses it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Weist Farms, yeah, my old partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the obvious point to state is
that you both recognize that the menthol
[SPEAKER_02]: was like a cool line and that's why it's
popped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it about the menthol that you're
really into?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a unique cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very like a white gelato with gassy
minty menthol turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really deep purple and tends to breed
very frosty exotically in plants with a
[SPEAKER_05]: good density and good flower time and very
robust and resilient to botryosin mold.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it checks all the boxes and it's really
a strong cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unique and it's a good breeder for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that really caught my eye about
it was that like the Jet Fuel Gelato,
[SPEAKER_02]: it had a lot of similar components in it,
but it notably had that white diesel in
[SPEAKER_02]: it, which I thought was interesting
because that came from white label seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I hadn't really heard a lot about,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the back story on those seeds and
like what kind of attracted you to using a
[SPEAKER_02]: fairly unknown breeders work?
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe a silly question, but I guess
that the strain itself is very menthol-y
[SPEAKER_02]: in flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I got the code.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called DOTS.
[SPEAKER_05]: We changed the name to the menthol.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was called the name in my friend's kids
house.
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, this looks like menthol.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we decided to call it menthol,
the name and stuff from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of the menthol crosses,
if someone was looking for one that was
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of the most menthol-y they can find,
because I've actually surprisingly had a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people say that that's like a
flavor profile that it's kind of a little
[SPEAKER_02]: actually hard to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which cross would you recommend that's
sort of the most menthol-y out of all of
[SPEAKER_02]: the lines you've done with it?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably the Tokyo Snow is probably my
favorite line.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Hibachi Supreme by the menthol,
which is Hibachi Supreme is GMO by Living
[SPEAKER_05]: Legends, which is LA confidential by
Legend OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a really unique cross that you
can't really guess in menthol-y.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's got some real powerhouse strains in
the mix there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your thoughts on the Legend OG?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen you've worked with it a little
bit and it's one of the more newer OGs on
[SPEAKER_02]: the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Which cut are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: The crinkle cut or the actual respect OG
cut for LA?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot that there was the two cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the crinkle is the preferred one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you tell me what's up.
[SPEAKER_05]: The crinkle is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really a true OG in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more like a cushy OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more, not usually is the actual LA
OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: The LA OG is more a true OG as far as I'm
concerned.
[SPEAKER_05]: The crinkle cut's more of a, it's a
different cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely, it's definitely more
powerhouse for sure that both Kings in
[SPEAKER_05]: their own right, but definitely different
for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I prefer the crinkle more than the other
LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think they are like sisters to
each other or just strains that happen to
[SPEAKER_02]: get the same name?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they share the same name.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're only similar in being OG to some
degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, moving on, there's so many
strains I could choose to talk about from
[SPEAKER_02]: your lineup, cause there's just been so
many powerful powerhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the one that I was pretty
interested in next was the, the CoLab you
[SPEAKER_02]: had got with Rado in the works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the gasoline grape.
[SPEAKER_05]: The grape gasoline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grape gasoline.
[SPEAKER_02]: My apologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did, how did this one come about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you try the grape pie and you were
like, oh, this is winner or how did it all
[SPEAKER_02]: happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Kenora's been a friend of mine for a
while since I started breeding and he's
[SPEAKER_05]: been a good, good ally, good person.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've bounced so many ideas off of him.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been very supportive of me since the
start.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, when I did the first trip to the
July pollination, I searched a grape pie
[SPEAKER_05]: cut and used it in the pollination and
asked Kenora if we could do a
[SPEAKER_05]: collaboration with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that cross I called it grape
gasoline.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he agreed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but nothing really came out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause we got sidetracked with other
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a few years later, I've been in
the line with my friend Phenoventures in
[SPEAKER_05]: Michigan and selected the cutout using
this pollination.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was so far, it was such an amazing term
profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: I reached out to Rado and said,
let's do a collaboration on this cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so he sent me some cuts and we made a
pollination and just in the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a really unique profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, really gravy and like
cross-servey gravy with some sour fuel is
[SPEAKER_05]: really one of my current favorites right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of sounds like what I imagine must
taste like, but it sounds like you've done
[SPEAKER_02]: even better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed on a few seed banks that we're
doing some pre-sales of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's all sold out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously like people are hyped as for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can these people expect from some of
the crosses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just some of that flavor imparted or
like you think it'll be more new sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors coming out of it?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's going to be lots of females in
there that are heavy grape, a fuely kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of like soury grape dominant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's also going to be some new
profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use a wide range of cultivars with a
wide range of terpium profiles.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to find lots of different
things based on the cultivars that we use.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I expect the growers to find some
really amazing females in the selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just mentioned Rado a moment ago
about someone who's like a friend and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, you like his work and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: A question I like to ask everyone who
comes on the show, are there any other
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders who maybe you're not necessarily
doing a collab with or anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you just kind of keep your eye on and
you think they're doing some good stuff?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right now in the Bay area,
there's a brewery called Dio Farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's doing lots of work down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: He doesn't really release any cultivars or
seeds into the polar food.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's doing lots of really good cultivar
development.
[SPEAKER_05]: He puts in the time and the work and does
really amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to watch for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nick Runs, he's the one that comes to mind
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the Runs guys are doing some good
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nick Runs from the Runs crew.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's putting in some real seed work with
the Runs guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you should see some stuff from them
next year also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think a lot of people in
including myself are really interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: the work you've been doing with the Runs
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first question I would generally
speaking want to ask is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Runs has been sweeping awards as of
recently for like strain of the year on a
[SPEAKER_02]: few different platforms.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your thoughts on Runs itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: You often hear people say that it's kind
of like a watered down gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you subscribe to that idea or you think
it's better, different?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Runs is one of the kinds,
something unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the real Runs is definitely not
watered down gelato.
[SPEAKER_05]: The triple profile on the white Runs is
incredible and hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like skills, but different.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just really unique and growing right
Runs is really of its own.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely not the biggest cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be a little finicky sometimes,
but real Runs is definitely a profile
[SPEAKER_05]: that's going to be here for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's definitely a staple if you get the
right cut and it's grown by the right
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, like all popular cuts,
I'm sure there are many imitations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that the reason maybe some
people have this somewhat negative view of
[SPEAKER_02]: it compared to gelato is just because
they're not getting the real deal?
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's lots of poorly grown Runs out
there that's kind of not doing it
[SPEAKER_05]: properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you need to find the right cut to get
the good representation of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, with that being said, you've done
a lot of work with the Runs already and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to delve into it even more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you feel like at this point,
if someone was to see Runs winning all
[SPEAKER_02]: these awards and they're like,
hey, I need to stop breeding with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like they're almost a bit too
late to the party to get on board that
[SPEAKER_02]: train?
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hot new thing anymore is out there
now, but the only thing that's going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: around for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see some hybrids of it and new
players of it for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a new staple for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that a lot of people were raving
about your Joker's line and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: wondering, was this where you first saw
the potential for the white Runs line
[SPEAKER_02]: itself or did that come at a different
time?
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw that potential initially,
but I was cautious to do it because I
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't want to like just take away the
glory from the Runs guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the white Runs policy kind of came
into fruition after becoming friends with
[SPEAKER_05]: Naking and working with the Runs guys more
and kind of decided to do some super
[SPEAKER_05]: projects together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, on that exact topic,
what's it like to collaborate in Runs in
[SPEAKER_02]: general?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like are they primarily sort of
the promotional part of it and you're kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of doing the breeding part of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you describe this collab?
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely did the work for the actual
process myself, but Nick Runs is
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely hands-on and has great ideas
and has lots of input on the cultivars and
[SPEAKER_05]: where to take things and how to move
forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's very influential in helping shape my
pace since I moved to San Francisco from
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a good taste and really is picky
about what he wants to move forward with
[SPEAKER_05]: Runs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's been very helpful with the
creative aspects and he puts a lot of work
[SPEAKER_05]: in behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't really see it kind of come to
fruition later as the forefront of the
[SPEAKER_05]: brand, but he's definitely played a big
role as far as the genetics and what most
[SPEAKER_05]: of the creative aspects are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think undeniably he's done a lot of work
in the creative aspect and like creating
[SPEAKER_02]: the brand and hyping it and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to ask just a minute ago,
the white Runs itself, it's got some cool
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics in the works given it's got the
menthol and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you give us a little rundown on how
the creation of this strain occurred?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it just sort of one of the strains you
were making at the time or did you really
[SPEAKER_02]: think like this one's going to be a win?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to do this pairing.
[SPEAKER_05]: White Runs?
[SPEAKER_05]: The cultivar itself you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The line, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the white Runs came from the Runs
guys themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's their work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just using it to make the linework.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I thought was when I was looking
through all the various lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all of them look insanely good,
but to me, the Rose and Gold Runs looks
[SPEAKER_02]: like it could be one of the most
anticipated strains, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: ever so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think people should expect
from these seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think they're just going to sell
out like hot fire?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I mean, that's what I imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you have any ideas about where you
want to take this line?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to work it further,
or do you have other projects you're more
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in working with in the future?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to find some standard cultivars
from the seeds and try to work those
[SPEAKER_05]: further and definitely incorporate some
new males I'm working with and take it
[SPEAKER_05]: further, but see where it goes and what we
find in the seeds and where the Runs guys
[SPEAKER_05]: want to go with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, something that I noticed from your
work in general is that you do seem to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a really wide diversity of like
unique females you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of them I like don't see being used
in other people's work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this come from you being like really
on top of like finding new clones and
[SPEAKER_02]: trading with people and whatnot?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you just do a lot of pheno hunting
yourself?
[SPEAKER_05]: A mixture of both.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really try to collect as many cultivars
as I can and really probe my network for
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds and breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to make my lineups for my products
as exclusive as possible and try to really
[SPEAKER_05]: hone in on new cutting edge flavors from
breeders that I respect and friends and
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of collect those and acquire them and
use them for my projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as well, as well as selecting my own
son and house, just to make sure we both
[SPEAKER_05]: have a wider network of people I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people I respect tend to stay social
with and kind of they trust me with their
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do lots of work with unique cuts that
I'm able to acquire, which has been one of
[SPEAKER_05]: the benefits to come from moving forward
and it's helped me have unique flavors and
[SPEAKER_05]: unique lines to release to the pova.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, in general, would you advise
aspiring breeders that they should be
[SPEAKER_02]: looking to sort of pheno hunt a little bit
within their own lines or it's okay to
[SPEAKER_02]: just sort of like just bring in new clones
and just pollinate them sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know that I guess I'm kind of
making that sound a bit bad, but I guess
[SPEAKER_02]: the question is, do you feel like it's
important for a breeder to pheno hunt
[SPEAKER_02]: within their own lines or it's kind of an
optional thing because enough people are
[SPEAKER_02]: finding new stuff all the time?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's important to work your own
stuff and make your name with your own
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think breeders also should not be too
afraid to network with other people.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a good thing to move
forward, especially with the modern era of
[SPEAKER_05]: like legalization and be able to be more
out there and not be so afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You still need to work your own stuff and
make name with your own work as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you go about creating new strains,
do you kind of do it in a conceptualized
[SPEAKER_02]: way where you're kind of thinking of
pairing two strains together and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, yeah, they're going to blend really
well together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it more of a case of like trial and
error and you're doing a big pollination
[SPEAKER_02]: and finding the ones that are standing out
and then proceeding with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more design, more plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely have more thought into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more premeditated.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to select the best things that
represent cultivars and traits I'm looking
[SPEAKER_05]: for and where I think the market's going,
what trends I see and kind of use that as
[SPEAKER_05]: my guiding tool along with my intuition
and kind of just what I want to see on the
[SPEAKER_05]: market under a compound that fits my
taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, great answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're doing breedings,
for example, I have to ask all our guests
[SPEAKER_02]: this because our viewers absolutely love
it and I love hearing about it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the things about a male
that would impress you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there characteristics?
[SPEAKER_02]: We often hear people talking about the
stem rubs, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your go to?
[SPEAKER_05]: My go to is bigger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stem rubs is a factor, but it's not really
a deciding factor to make.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be misleading for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stability, I like to do lots of testing on
males, dry-out testing, like different
[SPEAKER_05]: light cycles, things that would trigger
hemorrhaging, normal spinning to make sure
[SPEAKER_05]: it's stable.
[SPEAKER_05]: I look for how early flowers and how fast
the budsets go on, how dense the pollen
[SPEAKER_05]: stalks are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of different traits besides just the
chirping profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever toyed with the idea or
considered reverse a male and seeing the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes that come off the reversed male?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard of that being done and some
people have done it themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never tried it personally,
so I'd be curious to see how that works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I really want to, and I haven't been
able to figure out the answer to this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I want to know if it correlates.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you reverse a male and the male ends up
producing trichrome that smells like grape
[SPEAKER_02]: gasoline and then you try some of the
crosses of that male, does it consistently
[SPEAKER_02]: impart grape gasoline?
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavors, or is it not correlated in a way?
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be an interesting one,
I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be very curious to find out.
[SPEAKER_05]: The mystery about males is they never know
how to breed as opposed to the fens.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fens seem to be more dominant based on the
culture you reverse, but with males,
[SPEAKER_05]: you never know what's going to be dominant
or recessive or what's going to breed,
[SPEAKER_05]: true or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the mystery of the male.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mystery of the male.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a new catchphrase.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say you've made a new strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many seeds do you like to run to get
an idea of what's going on with those
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for example, if you ran 10 seeds
and found one hermy, would you be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: this line's bunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you feel like you've got to run more
than that to get an idea of what's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually going on within the line?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to run at least 50 to 100 seeds per
flavor to find a good representation of
[SPEAKER_05]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, ideally more to find a real stand
out, you know, going to stay with this
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You should be able to find a good
representation with at least 50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good number.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess this is a bit of a devil's in
the detail question, but hypothetically,
[SPEAKER_02]: at what point would you can align?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I've asked another guest this
in the past and it is a bit of a tough one
[SPEAKER_02]: to answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand, but let's just say,
for example, you ran 20 seeds or maybe 50
[SPEAKER_02]: and you found some of the best results
you'd ever seen ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the most fire stuff you ever found,
but you also found a number of
[SPEAKER_02]: hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you, at a certain point,
would you say, look, this is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: worth releasing because the fire is so
good, it makes up for the hermaphrodites?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is there a certain point where you're
like, look, I just don't accept that at
[SPEAKER_02]: all across the board?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really a fan of releasing genetics
that Hermia are unstable.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd probably end up releasing those proven
cuts instead of actually releasing the
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I try to stay away from releasing
things that are unstable and only release
[SPEAKER_05]: the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people have a strong proven
genetics that are crucial moving forward
[SPEAKER_05]: as people become more prone to it on
budgets.
[SPEAKER_05]: And having a proven genetics that are
strong is very important moving forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in general, do you like to do in-house
testing or do you use external testers?
[SPEAKER_05]: Mixed or both, I mean, you can't see
anything better than yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seeing firsthand is crucial, but I'd like
to have a group of people I can trust to
[SPEAKER_05]: do work with me as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, like five or ten people,
maybe a little more smaller group of
[SPEAKER_05]: people you can trust to take good
photographs and record good details and
[SPEAKER_05]: notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you raised a good point there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good photographs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's Mr. James Bean who said a
good photograph sells a thousand packets
[SPEAKER_02]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: How important do you feel photographs are
to being successful as a breeder in this
[SPEAKER_02]: modern era?
[SPEAKER_05]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you can only do so much of a hype
and reputation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the good seeds can sell a lot of
seeds and you can have a strange kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: standing still, you know, a good
photograph posted and boom, it'll sell 10
[SPEAKER_05]: packs overnight or 20 packs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think I see the photographs are
important.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it also shows that you put time in
to test your genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think back in the day, you get rid
of selling seeds more without photographs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the markets are going more savvy
and understanding more that no photographs
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of didn't really test it or didn't
put the time in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the photographs are the way
forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I guess an extension of that
question is, do you think it's possible to
[SPEAKER_02]: be commercially successful as a breeder in
today's climate and not be particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: active on social media?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure how far you'll go with that,
but you still can, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've asked that question to people
in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, funnily enough, we hear people
like Rado get mentioned who like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, aren't exactly posting every
day, but still kind of crush it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Rado does good work.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a staple of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's been one of the ones that kind of
paved the trail for the whole feminized
[SPEAKER_05]: market in the States, I think,
and kind of was a big inspiration for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rado has just put so much work in and has
done so many crosses over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's just, it's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think Rado has put out a really,
really good number of FEMS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you said, he paved the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your thoughts on FEMS?
[SPEAKER_02]: We often hear people like say things like,
mothers that come from feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't as good as mothers from regular
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you buy into that at all?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't buy into that at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not true at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe if it comes from unsealed parents to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think good families with solid
parents that are tested and aren't made
[SPEAKER_05]: of, like, with herafroin genetics or
genetically with unsealed traits can
[SPEAKER_05]: really stand a test of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we hear a wide variety of sort of
whispers and rumors about strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one I hear is that like,
females from FEM seeds, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a bit of a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, they're females.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants from FEM seeds, like, will lose
vigor quicker than regular ones will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that another one where you think that's
just an inaccuracy?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe that at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's untrue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's lots of rumors and
misconceptions about feminized seeds that
[SPEAKER_05]: just come from misinformation.
[SPEAKER_05]: People aren't really doing an homework and
just believing what they hear on the
[SPEAKER_05]: internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's certainly a lot of rumors,
isn't there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess to follow up, on that point
about sort of losing vigor and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_02]: given you've got the dog shit and the
cough and some of these quite more older
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, do you have any ideas about what
results in strains losing vigor over time?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been replacing that in reality in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not exactly sure what contributes to
that, but I think there's several things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, overall, plant care and plants
getting abused over time with sprays and
[SPEAKER_05]: treatments and tests and disease and poor
growth conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it dripped over time and,
you know, cloning and reverting to veg.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what the science behind that,
but I know current problems like hoplite
[SPEAKER_05]: and virus and things like that can
definitely make plants change.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, unfortunately, I've been able to back
all my age.
[SPEAKER_05]: I come from a tissue culture with no labs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have all my stuff cleaned now and
it's all tested.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been able to utilize all proven
sterile plants in my breeding products
[SPEAKER_05]: moving forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a real advantage to my products
and helped me maintain my plant vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what a great segue.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just gave me, I read the article in
High Times you did with T.H.
[SPEAKER_02]: Caesar about tissue culture, and I thought
that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it that first caused you to get
involved with tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you first find out about it?
[SPEAKER_05]: About 2014, I found out about it and I was
just fascinated by it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it seemed really interesting the
way forward possibly.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it took me a while to get into it,
but I was able to meet some people at the
[SPEAKER_05]: DSG labs who interested to know the labs
and just networking through my
[SPEAKER_05]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been pretty amazing to see what T
.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: can do with the plant and how you can
really improve plants and really
[SPEAKER_05]: revitalize them through T.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: and back up some extra genetics easily
with T.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has lots of advantages.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really cool to see the way forward
and see where it can go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I've ever really spoken to
anyone who got tissue culture done on
[SPEAKER_02]: their clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you believe that tissue culture would
get rid of like that vigor issue we just
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned in the prior question,
or it's more like getting rid of hoplite
[SPEAKER_02]: and virus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen T.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: bring back vigor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's going to bring back
like turps like anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plants like drifted and the turps are kind
of like gone.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not going to change that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen that bring back sour diesel
turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't seen that happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's some misconceptions for
sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But overall, I definitely see it bringing
back vigor and plant health on plants that
[SPEAKER_05]: need it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certain ones, not all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not like a blanket approach, but it
definitely can help certain plants for
[SPEAKER_05]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel like the difference
between the clone once it's undergone the
[SPEAKER_02]: tissue culture process versus before is
quite substantial or it's more like a
[SPEAKER_02]: subtle thing you need to be familiar to
pick up on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some plants are night and day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some plants go from like one pound to two
and a half pounds overnight with the T.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really amazing to see the difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's a subtle difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very different from cultivar to
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, do you think that we'll see
like this delineation over time where like
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a subdivision between like there's
like the sour D clone and the tissue sour
[SPEAKER_02]: D clone and like the tissue one gets like
a bit hoarded or whatever?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that we'll see that
divergence over time or not really?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's something to be said for
constantly replenishing your mother's
[SPEAKER_05]: stock of T.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you want to do that, we'll
definitely have a different version of
[SPEAKER_05]: their kind over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the people that can back it up faster
in T.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: too before it like gets older or gets
better, we definitely think we'll have a
[SPEAKER_05]: more elite version of that kind for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll see some other way forward for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, as a final sort of question on
tissue culture, do you think that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just going to become a standard part of
the industry where like pretty much most
[SPEAKER_02]: successful breeders end up getting their
older stuff tissue culture or do you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's still a bit of a sort of nuanced
thing that not everyone's necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: going to engage in?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's still a nuance and still new.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll take a while for it to like
catch on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll always be the traditional breeder in
this space doing its old pruning.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that'll still be around,
but I think the way forward, the more
[SPEAKER_05]: recreational growers, the more mainstream
growers adapt to the T.C., it'll
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely become a standard move forward
as the industry progresses, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, over the past, say,
two years or probably, probably more,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for me, I've noticed it in the past
two years or so that like different
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting has come a long way, particularly
the LED stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your thoughts on the LED lights?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you jumped on board that yet?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've used it for some pollinations,
for sure, and for flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen some advantages to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, definitely there's a different
lighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much lighting that's going on
in this industry, it's hard to keep track
[SPEAKER_05]: of it all, but LED definitely has a place
to stay, for sure, and definitely,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, going to grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I don't really have any
preference over the two, but it definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: is a good lighting, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do good breeding with it in small
spaces like tents and stuff like that and
[SPEAKER_05]: not have to worry about heating as much
and burning your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for the reduced heat output.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned doing pollinations there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your preferred style of
pollination?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like kind of doing it by hand and having a
real hands-on approach to things,
[SPEAKER_02]: or do you just like to stick the mail in
the room and give it a good shake?
[SPEAKER_05]: A very hands-on check on each plant,
making sure it's pollinated up and down,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's light-covered, and you get the
most out of each plant for seed
[SPEAKER_05]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it was the late sub-cool who
said that he liked to pollinate around
[SPEAKER_02]: week two, week three.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your sweet spot for pollination in
order to get like really good seed output
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as good seed quality in terms of
maturation?
[SPEAKER_05]: Around week two and a half to week three
to week four, it's the latest for seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I find it works the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you tend to do like a few
pollinations or just the one, and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty satisfactory?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you mean one pollination?
[SPEAKER_05]: Two or three times at least, maybe four
times.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of rounds in the room,
make sure it's fully saturated and fully
[SPEAKER_05]: covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You nailed the question perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, have you ever worked with any
of your females that you're reversing to
[SPEAKER_02]: do a pollination, and you've found that
like the pollen's not particularly,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's not being taken by the female
plants?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never had that happen, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all been pretty successful and very
robust with this pollination and seed
[SPEAKER_05]: production.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I always read about like,
you know, how there's the infamous TK,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is like people really struggle to
get pollen from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you hear about, you know, on the other
end of the equation, MAC-1, which is not
[SPEAKER_02]: accepting the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of an interesting concept,
the idea of like plants not wanting to
[SPEAKER_02]: accept pollen in a certain regard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen that with MAC-1 for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did a pollination with MAC-1 and the
Jephyll Gelato and basically done the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole MAC-1 plan and got about like 10 to
15 seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've seen it happen with MAC-1.
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The MACs were really like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure what causes that to
happen, but it's definitely a weird plan
[SPEAKER_05]: for pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Overall, what would be your advice for
kind of a novice, kind of more emerging
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder, someone who's trying to get the
wheels rolling on their own thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be some advice you'd give them
in terms of like how they can do it
[SPEAKER_02]: properly and help establish a good name
and brand for themselves?
[SPEAKER_05]: Try to make something unique of your own
first before you start a brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Create a unique cultivator of your own and
work that, make sure it's stable and
[SPEAKER_05]: unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: And once you have something of your own,
it's kind of like use that as like your
[SPEAKER_05]: introduction to the flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people will just like take a pack
of seeds and like pop them in front of
[SPEAKER_05]: other breeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do some real work and you get your
own, it's just one crop, but it's your own
[SPEAKER_05]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a lot better chance of making
waves with your own company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I've noticed about your brand
compound is that you've done really well
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of getting your seeds into a
variety of different seed banks and
[SPEAKER_02]: distributors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really helping to get the seeds
out there to market, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be your advice for someone
who's hoping to get their seeds to a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: bank at some point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's just about presentation
and like promoting the brand or what was
[SPEAKER_02]: your advice on that front?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think presentation is definitely very
important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having good photographs and good
Instagrams, social media presence is huge,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just having the right names.
[SPEAKER_05]: Naming is important and branding is key
for having a new brand now as the market
[SPEAKER_05]: continues to progress.
[SPEAKER_05]: So branding and presentation is a big
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're a director of fire, you'll do
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Proof is in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, on that exact topic, many people
will point to cookie fam and to a lesser
[SPEAKER_02]: extent to runts and say that these are the
leaders in terms of illustrating that
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing and brand presentation is
arguably the most important thing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, it needs to be backed by good
quality product, but marketing is king.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you agree with that sort of idea?
[SPEAKER_05]: Marketing is definitely important.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think quality is king over marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got a really pretty bag and really
nice branding, but you don't have a fire
[SPEAKER_05]: flower in the bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only going to go so far.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think quality is strong for that all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And really good marketing with really good
genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think both of those yielded really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, solid sentiment there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a few questions ago, you
referenced the idea of like if you had
[SPEAKER_02]: like a fire strand, but there was some
herms in it, like rather than releasing
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you would just sort of release cuts
and try to get those out to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm noticing that there's an increase of
that in the industry in terms of like
[SPEAKER_02]: we've seen JBZ do it with the cookie fam a
bit, like kind of like contracting or
[SPEAKER_02]: creating certain cuts for them to then
sell under their line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something you're going to pursue
further?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I noticed that I think you're
likewise doing that with the cookie fam,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm working extensively with cookies
and burner right now to develop players
[SPEAKER_05]: for their venue and to create new strands
for their brands and for the move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: So over the next year, you'll see a larger
amount of compound players for the cookie
[SPEAKER_05]: brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be working with most of their
library.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll see lines in culturists from the
flower brand and I'll watch a new project
[SPEAKER_05]: coming forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some rumours that JBZ was
working pretty exclusively with cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: going forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've heard that maybe he's bowing out
and you're going to become the more prime
[SPEAKER_02]: time collaborator with cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any truth to that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't speak on JBZ.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what he's doing, but I'm
definitely working more with burner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll see compound and cookies a lot
next year and move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, compound and cookies is here to
stay for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And doesn't the name roll off the tongue
as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Compound cookies, I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like it too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Runs compound, they're both catchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Runs compound as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you imagine like a little jail being
like staffed by little Runs guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the next question that comes to
mind is I'd love to just quickly chat
[SPEAKER_02]: about burner.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a sec, because I've become a bit of a
burner fan over the past year or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it all started when
Sticker Farmer put up a post saying like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, people hate on burner.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is this guy has created an
industry in terms of like exotics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are so many people who are
putting food on the table because of what
[SPEAKER_02]: he's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that's a really unique
perspective on burner that no one's really
[SPEAKER_02]: put out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's true, as far as I can tell,
like people are eating because of this
[SPEAKER_02]: guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like there's truth in that
statement?
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely think burner's paved the way
as an industry leader.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's definitely a visionary.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as that's concerned, he's
definitely opened the doors for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's definitely an influential person
in the scene.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's definitely helped many people make a
name for themselves and he continues to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think sometimes people try to like
give him a bit of flack saying like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he's just this hype man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't do much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got a sneaking suspicion that he
probably works very hard behind the
[SPEAKER_02]: scenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your perspective?
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably should have asked you a bit
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you first get in touch with him
and how did this collaboration come about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally, about two years ago,
he reached out to me to do a project in
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked about that for a while,
but it really came from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when I moved to LA, to California,
excuse me, I reached out to him again and
[SPEAKER_05]: he asked for some samples and we connected
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you think is the future for
the Cookies crew?
[SPEAKER_02]: And can I put a little prediction out
there that I feel like apples and bananas
[SPEAKER_02]: is just taken off?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's hot for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a stable strength for
next year, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, more fire flavors, more compound,
more innovation, more leading the pack for
[SPEAKER_05]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's exciting stuff to be able to
follow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, following up on the apples and
bananas, it's one of the strains from you
[SPEAKER_02]: that has seriously caught my attention,
possibly more than others, along with
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously the masses just jumping on it
like hotcakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it about this strain that you
think makes it so unique?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a balance between those two sort of
flavor profiles or what makes it stand out
to you?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a combination of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the name, the flavor profile,
the triggering profile, the bag appeal,
[SPEAKER_05]: the potency, it just checks all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The burning with burns to the next level.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a staple.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really good strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: It grows well, it's vigorous and it yields
buds that are really appealing to smoke
[SPEAKER_05]: and look at.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all around enjoyable to have in your
jar, in your bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's going to be a good one,
giving good responses towards it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I haven't heard anything really bad
about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been really unfortunate to have
that response and see it being received so
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully it continues to make waves
and it does well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to be one of the hot
ones moving forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how would you describe the flavor
profile on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've heard a lot of people talk
about the apple flavor, not from apples
[SPEAKER_02]: and bananas, but just the apple flavor in
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say like, oh, you know,
like it's not really bang on apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a round apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you describe apples and bananas as
having like a somewhat clear apple and
[SPEAKER_02]: banana flavor, or is it more leaning to
one side than the other?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more like a gassy ripe apple with a
banana exhale.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really a chewed up like a sour
apple or apple fritter.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more of a more dried apple.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say it's more of a gassy fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really a fruity fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's more gas in there and more of a
fuely flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you just referenced the apple
fritter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed that the fruit is really
doing well for itself and doing the rounds
[SPEAKER_02]: at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like that has the bang on
apple flavor?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know about bang on, but it's an
apple turp.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's kind of paved the way for the
whole apple trend right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see last year, I think along with the
sour apple itself, but I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_05]: a good representation of apples for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you plan on doing any more work with,
because I think apple fritters from Lumpy,
[SPEAKER_02]: is it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Lumpster, I believe out of
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other sort of cuts or
strains from Lumpy that you plan to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with in the future?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any other ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the only one I have right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: His work is really unique though.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's one of the trendsetters currently in
the industry for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to jump back to the apples and
bananas for a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I was wondering more
than anything is what are the genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: behind it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a granddaddy purple by pot of cookies
by blue power by gelati.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mixture of the gelati with like the
granddaddy purple and some like blue power
[SPEAKER_05]: gas from Sin City seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really cool mixture of like new
and old genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any fond memories of the
granddaddy purple?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about blue power?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that's making a resurgence
with Sin City's having that newer release
[SPEAKER_02]: recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, really kind of nice mixture of
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the next step for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: With the apples and bananas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the rose gold runs?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to be doing a feminized line
with burner cookies the next year that
[SPEAKER_05]: we're working on now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to do a BX line with a
regular line with a new male.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to find a BX that and more
called order to develop with the rose gold
[SPEAKER_05]: runs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to find new genifianas
from the seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also doing a gastropop with grape
gasoline by apples and bananas with
[SPEAKER_05]: canorados.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hunting that soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to find some standard
genifianas from that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hybrid with the grape gasoline.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like that's going to be like
fruit punch amazingness.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you mentioned you're going to
be doing a line with cookies next year
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any females from the cookie
library like that, that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Bern has got that you think it's going to
pair particularly well with, or maybe like
[SPEAKER_02]: a bit of a secret female that people
aren't aware of, but you think it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to make waves when you pair it together?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man, so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really excited to work with the burner
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm especially like the F1 during one of
the original cookie cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: His grenadine is a, we're going to have
the fish scale also.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the other new cookie compound cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bunch of new stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then you're doing like thin inch rubato
and some stray Burmese and some sour
[SPEAKER_05]: cherry stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you just got a bunch of new genifianas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm excited to search through the new
samples and try to find the best ones
[SPEAKER_05]: using our collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just gave me so many good avenues to
go off on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the first one thing that you've
just brought to mind is I, it's now
[SPEAKER_02]: clicked in my head that obviously you've
got access to the cookie fam genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I see on your drops that maybe
you've made a hybrid with snowman,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that with the real snowman or with the
S1 that's still quite hard to get,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not the original one, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you referenced the F1 derb and
just in that previous answer, have you
[SPEAKER_02]: seen that flower on its own and like,
what's your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's such an elusive thing to come
by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a lot of people out there who
still don't even know if it really exists,
[SPEAKER_02]: including myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fish scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you been lucky enough to try that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't actually been able to come
across that one in flower form.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I made that cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's one of the new cookie
confectioners as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cross of the menthol by high
society.
[SPEAKER_05]: High society is a Jephyll buscati.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's Jephyll buscati by the menthol.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, really gassy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tri-comb coverage, very unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, congrats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard that one's doing really quite
well for itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome to see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the new ones for next year as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it feels like cookies has struck on a
winning equation whereby they get like a
[SPEAKER_02]: really skilled breeder that they're happy
with to help them with the breeding work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they kind of take more control
over like the marketing and the
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how you envision this
collaboration going forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think that you've both got more
input in either side of the equation than
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe I'm making it out like?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's more of a harmonic
relationship, more on the same page.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I have marketing and creative
control as well as they do and we will
[SPEAKER_05]: have a good vision moving forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's more of a share of
strategy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we'll move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: They definitely have a good marketing
approach and a good vision for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's a good fit.
[SPEAKER_05]: We both complement each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the secret to winning
success, I guess, is that, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're both helping out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read in an article that was talking
about apples and bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It said a line that really got me
thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It said, sneakerheads line up out front of
Supreme stores to get the newest shoe
[SPEAKER_02]: drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And soon many of these same people will be
lining up out front of dispensary for the
[SPEAKER_02]: new apples and banana drops from Cookies
and Compound CoLab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like this statement is true in
that the cannabis scene is becoming a
[SPEAKER_02]: marketplace where the hypebeasts are
starting to really get involved,
[SPEAKER_02]: who were maybe once historically more just
invested in the sneaker game, but now
[SPEAKER_02]: they're trying to be likewise at the
forefront of the cannabis scene?
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think cannabis is becoming more trending
as it becomes more legal and it becomes
[SPEAKER_05]: more accepted publicly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to see more and more trends
and more shifts into that as the market
[SPEAKER_05]: progresses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think that we're going to see
just a continual rise of more of the
[SPEAKER_02]: exotic types of strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think that there is still room
for other strains to do well in the
[SPEAKER_02]: masses?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's room for all of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just proven in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the culture are done right,
we'll stay out and shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was doing a bunch of digging around
your Instagram finding some questions and
[SPEAKER_02]: I came across a post which caught my eye,
which was that when you were testing the
[SPEAKER_02]: jokers crossed, there was a tube which I
think had a seedling in it that was jokers
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed to Black Lime Reserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that caught my eye because I like
Black Lime Reserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a neat strain from aficionado and
mean gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a line that caught your attention
and you want to work with it in the future
[SPEAKER_02]: or was it just more of like a little
experiment you were toying with?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it seems like a cool cross to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm excited to follow the results on
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a question I bring up in every episode,
because it's just a staple of our show in
[SPEAKER_02]: general is Chem Dog, I've seen that you've
worked with the Chem D in a few crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've also worked with Chem D I-95
hybrids or killer stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on the Chem Dog
cuttings and do you have a preferred one?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't throw off fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the gas on the flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: The high is incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very unique high.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really prone to the high.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more of a knock you on your ass high
as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like to be so inhabilitated or
knocked out, but it's really a staple for
[SPEAKER_05]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wholeheartedly agree with you on that
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am someone who does enjoy smoking during
the day, but it can be debilitating at
[SPEAKER_02]: times when you smoke the chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess my question becomes, what's some
of your favorite daytime smoke then that
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of puts you in that right spot
to, you know, not be couch lock and still
[SPEAKER_02]: go about your daily activities?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, my go-to is Runs Crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like the Runs profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a strong terpium profile,
but it's not too strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's right around like 24, 25,
the maximum.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good terpium profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good daytime smoke and it kind of
keeps me through the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to have something that's really
strong and terpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you ever smoke any like sort of
wild sativas, like, you know, this sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: anxiety inducing ones you sometimes hear
about or not so much?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't trust those at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be the exact same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hated them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then somehow, I don't know how I
slowly started to like them a bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of found that anxiety a bit fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as someone who used to not enjoy it,
I totally get where you're coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a bit of a random one, is there any
strain that jumps to mind for you that was
[SPEAKER_02]: like the most sort of anxiety inducing one
you've ever had?
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably a strain called Golden Pineapple,
or a non-homotic Durban.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cross of NO5 by Durban poison from
the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really racy sativa.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got me going pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I've actually tried Golden
Pineapple before and that's a lovely one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great terpium profile on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, really classic Pineapple terp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really strong yielder too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in general, what are some genetics,
either from your own or from outside of
[SPEAKER_02]: your own work from other people,
what are some genetics that you're excited
[SPEAKER_02]: to pop next?
[SPEAKER_05]: Next, probably the white runs crosses over
my radar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really looking forward to working the
runs crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Apples and banana crosses, the grape grass
crosses, all the new stuff that's going on
[SPEAKER_05]: with my stuff for next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: The cookies layers, all the stuff that
we're working on.
[SPEAKER_05]: The gas, the runs crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: The scalar crosses are really big for me
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really big fan of scalar crosses and gas
and all the cookie stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really excited.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all turning for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, the debate is age old,
so I don't expect you to necessarily give
[SPEAKER_02]: any definitive rulings.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of people often speculate about
the genetics within Skittles, as well as
[SPEAKER_02]: the genetics within cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't suppose you have any speculations
about what's exactly involved in either of
[SPEAKER_02]: those clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure exactly at all, but I know
I'm good friends with Turpolox guys that
[SPEAKER_05]: made Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd say that what they say is true.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Tony, he's a regular guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not one to lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I believe when he says grape A by sweet
tooth or something like that, I definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: think that it's just a weird pheno that
kind of came out with Turby without the
[SPEAKER_05]: actual structure and bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, when we look at Skittles
itself, you often hear people talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: how it just doesn't quite have that bag
appeal that some of the other exotics
[SPEAKER_02]: have.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were to come across a new strain
that was similar to that, or even in
[SPEAKER_02]: general, when you're just working with
Skittles, do you view that as like,
[SPEAKER_02]: no biggie, just got to make a cross that
brings the bag appeal and just keeps
[SPEAKER_02]: everything else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you view that as like, oh,
that's kind of like a bit of a bad trait
[SPEAKER_02]: for a strain to have?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bad trait for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Skittles kind of got lucky with
that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure, because I think it's hard to
replicate that over.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with that said, I think Turps are king
and Turps will always shine over
[SPEAKER_05]: structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think market will still appreciate a cut
as far as its worthiness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Turby over structure and vigour,
the cultivators are just going to hate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's a fine balance of what the market
wants versus what the cultivator wants to
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it will be interesting to see how that
will move forward in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any speculations about what
is, in fact, inside cookies?
[SPEAKER_05]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I can't comment on that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I honestly think that we'll probably
never find out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with you probably, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a mystery for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it really probably actually
just adds to the mystique, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the fact I'm asking you about it
right now is just kind of a testament to,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, why maybe it's a good thing we don't
find out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Same thing with ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who knows what ChemDog means?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mystery to a degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, on the topic of Turps, I noticed that
in your library, you made a cross-cord The
[SPEAKER_02]: Leopard, and I loved the name of the mum,
Cheetos Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only is it a cool name, but it also
kind of evokes these cool images of
[SPEAKER_02]: flavour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did that one come from, and what's
it like, the Cheetos Kush?
[SPEAKER_05]: I see that cut from a friend of mine
called Manic Farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's across the Bova Kush by UK Cheese.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bova, like, structured with the cheese
profile, with the cushy aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I guess it probably does have,
like, a Cheetos sort of flavour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's really solid with the name,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess it raises the idea of how
important do you think a name is to a
[SPEAKER_02]: cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, some names make and break,
but other names, you can't help but feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like they're not really fitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your approach when naming a strain?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think names are very important moving
forward, and it really just kind of sets
[SPEAKER_05]: up the tone for a strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a bad name can really hold a
strain back as far as appeal in the
[SPEAKER_05]: market, but I think naming is really
critical.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think most people don't do strains just
with cheesy names or names that aren't
[SPEAKER_05]: very classy.
[SPEAKER_05]: They try to have names that are
stand-at-test-of-time, more timeless
[SPEAKER_05]: names, more well-thought-out names,
not just something that's kind of thrown
[SPEAKER_05]: together, trying to really be creative and
figure out things that are going to last,
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of like stick around for a while and
appeal to a wider audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember who it was, but in a
previous episode, we spoke about how,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, it's a bit frustrating when a really
cool name gets given to a shitty strain
[SPEAKER_02]: because, like, now you just can't use that
name anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: On that general line of thinking,
are there any of your lines that you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like haven't properly been discovered by
the general public, or as the fans might
[SPEAKER_02]: say, they've been a little slept on?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually, my lines are pretty well
received.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm actually agreeing for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, gosh, what a position to be in.
[SPEAKER_02]: My seeds are too well-received.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess another question I was really
interested in asking you is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's been such a prevalent rise in the
consumption of concentrates over the past
[SPEAKER_02]: four or five years, particularly with,
like, the sort of casual enthusiasts
[SPEAKER_02]: getting involved in cannabis more and
more, and we see a lot of increase in vape
[SPEAKER_02]: pen sales and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there's merit to trying to
breed a strain specifically for
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates or for, like, vape pen
production, given how prevalent it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: or do you think that's just, like,
a secondary thought to just creating a
[SPEAKER_02]: good plan in general?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's something to be said for
that, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's definitely a market for that to
move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's definitely certain
profiles that you bring out for
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrates that are different from
flower production that are huge,
[SPEAKER_05]: that definitely have advantages versus
traditional flower production.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've really dabbled in that myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, like, see people doing that,
like, Bloom Seed Co., like, Oni Seed Co.,
[SPEAKER_05]: where they focus on the more
extract-worthy cultivars, but it's
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely, I've really dabbled in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you have any strong feelings one
way or the other about the rise in
[SPEAKER_02]: popularity of vape pens?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some breeders and some people
within the industry are kind of really not
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly stoked about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the high is different.
[SPEAKER_05]: The taste is a little off, but there's a
place for them, for sure, in the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm more of a rosin guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the go-to?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my concentrate, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, would you say that you prefer rosin
over, say, flower?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flower is king for me, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Flower first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man, after my own heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it starts at the core first,
and then you go to extract after the
[SPEAKER_05]: flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: The real deal first.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, for me, nothing will ever get me
as satisfied as just trying some nice
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be the bee's knees.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with you, man, fully.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, are there any
sort of strains you've ever made or just
[SPEAKER_02]: tried, maybe not necessarily made by you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where they really just blew you away once
you got some flower of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've tried.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my favourite strains I've tried was
Soma's Lavender in Amsterdam over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember that tribute profile being so
amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really have experienced that since that
date.
[SPEAKER_05]: Blown away by that profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of my favourite ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's actually an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We hear a lot of people reminisce about
Soma's Lavender.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder what happened to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it's how it looks or we'll have
to hit it up and find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, to get back to kind of some of
the more recent work you've been doing in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of your collaborations with various
people, before we get into the some more
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of specific questions about it,
I wanted to ask you a general question,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is that in the past, we've spoken to
guests and they've spoken about how they
[SPEAKER_02]: hope that over time, there'll be this
emergence of like the ultra high end
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis market, kind of in the same way
we see that with like champagne or with
[SPEAKER_02]: whiskey, you know, like the real primo of
the primo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that with the current trends
in the community where people are willing
[SPEAKER_02]: to pay more for weed and willing to pay
more for exclusive cannabis and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, do you think that we will see
the development of such a premium market
[SPEAKER_02]: or like a terroir or an Appalachia sort of
thing like that over time?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the market started earlier in its
progression.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think as you see more legalisation and
acceptance in the market coming forward,
[SPEAKER_05]: you'll see a lot more maturity of things
as far as what you described.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like it's still emerging or
like we're there now already?
[SPEAKER_05]: Very early.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's still very, very,
very early.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's still a lot to come, a lot more
events, a lot more levels of presentation
[SPEAKER_05]: and experiences to come in the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're still very, very,
very early phases of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to kind of bring back in the ideas we
were discussing about the names of strains
[SPEAKER_02]: in relation to this high end market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any strong feelings about the
name game at the moment in the sense that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've heard people in the past express a
certain sentiment that like they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: super fond of like the dessert menu sort
of names where, you know, every sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: dessert is getting used up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're now even seeing things like you
mentioned with the sushi and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's wagyu.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're even moving away from dessert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that we're going to move away
from dessert names?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that that's going to have any
impact on the development of this high end
[SPEAKER_02]: market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it's just people being
weird about names?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people would be worried about
names.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think some of these names are here to
stay.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to go away anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be curious to see how the naming
plays out once you can actually trademark
[SPEAKER_05]: names and people are using names over
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no rules to naming.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are just renaming names that people
have used in the past.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's getting kind of messy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'd be interesting to see how that
pans up moving forward and how people can
[SPEAKER_05]: actually lock down names and secure their
names.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be less likely once things become
legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, while we're kind of talking
about the names, how do you feel having
[SPEAKER_02]: done this collaboration with Khalifa has
affected you, like with Wiz, in terms of,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you feel Cross is using the Khalifa ROG
do well because of the name just on its
[SPEAKER_02]: own?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it's not as simple as
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it doesn't do well on their own.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the name is more of a widely known
in the market now as marketing behind us.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the marketing helps that strength
go well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's also a good OG to give us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys have the advantage of being
ahead of the curve with the marketing and
[SPEAKER_05]: having presence in the industry for a time
since you first did marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that'll play well for them
moving forward in the future to their
[SPEAKER_05]: success.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that doing collaborations
with like entertainers, like rappers,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, is going to be something we
see more of in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I remember initially when Berner
first hit the scene, people were really
[SPEAKER_02]: critical of the fact that like he had this
sort of rap gig on the side, but it now
[SPEAKER_02]: seems like it's becoming more mainstream
and just introducing more people into the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your thoughts on the collabs with
like famous entertainers and the like?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there'll be lots of them moving
forward, but I'm cautious to like do them
[SPEAKER_05]: with everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at my DM on Instagram,
I get certain messages every day from
[SPEAKER_05]: people wanting to do a strain constantly.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much does it cost to do a strain or
how do I get a strain?
[SPEAKER_05]: So everyone wants that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you'll see plenty of people trying to
jump on that bandwagon moving forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: But who can do it right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who can actually execute it properly and
not water it down and do it?
[SPEAKER_05]: I see so many brands coming out right now
that have poor quality of flower and poor
[SPEAKER_05]: quality overall.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if you don't have quality and
don't have something that's unique and
[SPEAKER_05]: people won't go very far.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, that's the key for those products
and having a real state in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, I'm going to have to thank you
again for replying to my email considering
[SPEAKER_02]: you got famous rappers filling up the
inbox.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, all kinds of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: People wanting to strain you make you
horny.
[SPEAKER_05]: Weird messages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a Viagra company hitting you up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rappers are here for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people do a while with their ideas.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, something which just came to mind
that I would love to ask you before I
[SPEAKER_02]: forget about is that I've seen this
sentiment expressed by a few different
[SPEAKER_02]: people within the community where they're
saying like many of the top brands at the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment, you ask them about their grow
space and like they don't even have grow
[SPEAKER_02]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're outsourcing to other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that that's going to become
more standard or do you think that's even
[SPEAKER_02]: is there any even truth to that as far as
you can tell?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no truth to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lots of people are outsourcing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely calling in this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a few people actually have it all
vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like some people do it very rare to see
someone doing it all on their own.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most people have some partners to some
degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Challenging to get it all valid all by
yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's more over time to see that
have it have it with brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's still wildly labeling done
for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be surprised how many brands have
wildly labeling done for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think over time that it's just
going to become segregated?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there'll be people who produce and
then they sell to the brands and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: brands retail or do you think it's just a
temporary period we're in?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'll still continue.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think all of these brands that have
brands that will kind of fail and have to
[SPEAKER_05]: end up doing what they're labeling to
survive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll make sure the ones that can hold
on to their actual brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the ones that are kind of like
fall for that to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, yeah, certain times people find
themselves in a bit of a tight spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to jump away from that for just a
moment, I just wanted to quickly jump back
[SPEAKER_02]: to the breeding stuff for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: We often talk to breeders about their sort
of hierarchy of traits in terms of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: for you, you've mentioned already Terps is
very important, but in terms of things
[SPEAKER_02]: like yield, ease of growing, stability,
what are sort of some of the things that
[SPEAKER_02]: you think of first and foremost in your
mind when you're creating a new cross that
[SPEAKER_02]: you want it to have within it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides terms that say structure and
bigger impotency, I think it's very
[SPEAKER_05]: important that a cultivar is viable for
someone to cultivate on a commercial scale
[SPEAKER_05]: before getting into the recreational
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't want to make cultivars that are
just like check one box or terpenes or
[SPEAKER_05]: proponents that should be yielded in bad,
bigger.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's very important to check all
the boxes and really focus on robust
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics, very important things that
really please all aspects of the
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation and flower profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like having it well rounded.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, it's very important for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your thoughts on the current
sort of seed pricing within the market?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard people in the past talk about
how like we should get standardized
[SPEAKER_02]: pricings where like, you know,
everyone sells an F1 for the same price,
[SPEAKER_02]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any particular thoughts about
the seed game and pricing or do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just like market forces?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's market forces and I think
some banks charge more than others,
[SPEAKER_05]: unfortunately, that would abide by breeder
rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it all comes down to just your
brand presence and how good your seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think probably the prism of the pudding.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you pay for what you get for and I
really don't like the idea of expensive
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they should be more middle of the
road, not too expensive or like rare gen,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, people don't want to pop with
their stuff, something like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: but middle of the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the reason why this came to mind
for me is because I remember not too long
[SPEAKER_02]: ago, there was a lot of people who were a
bit upset about the price point of that
[SPEAKER_02]: runce release.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think many of the packs were selling
for around $700 each.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like there should be any sort
of upper limit to how much seeds should
[SPEAKER_02]: cost?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, should there be any consideration
for like sort of having cost accessible
[SPEAKER_02]: lines for the public?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think, look, it's just market
forces.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone wants to offer like a cheaper
line for other people to be able to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: their work out, so be it, or what's your
thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just a case that not everyone gets
to own a Gucci bag, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there should be seeds that
are available to the public at a cheaper
[SPEAKER_05]: price than anyone can buy, but I don't
think there's something to be said for
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds that are upper scale, like,
you know, more luxury seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know with those runce seeds,
those are very, very limited.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those guys fill out the time and
development of the seeds is to have a more
[SPEAKER_05]: exclusive, limited release only available
to certain people in a small scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was their approach.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think $700 is an excessive for
seed packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think likewise, some of those same
people who weren't too happy about the
[SPEAKER_02]: runce release kind of had some concerns
that maybe that seed drop was the result
[SPEAKER_02]: of a crop failure that kind of pollinated
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there's any merit to that
idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it's just simply a case
that the runce team kept the project under
[SPEAKER_02]: wraps and didn't really reveal it until it
was complete?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, another line of yours which
caught my eye because it's really cool was
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend Orange Apricot F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first question was, does it have an
actual apricot taste?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've never been able to come
across that flavor profile before.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does to a degree.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more of an orange profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a mixture of orange with
apricot-esque.
[SPEAKER_05]: The actual male we used didn't translate
to true apricot, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_05]: as opposed to the original orange apricot
cultivar from obsolete.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's definitely some orange and
some apricot in there for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was your kind of goal when making
the F2s?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it just to get a bigger genetic
diversity so you could find a male more
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically embodying what you wanted?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how did you go about doing the F2?
[SPEAKER_05]: I received those seeds as F2 when I
received them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I originally got the seeds from Capuletor
at Charlottesville in 2016.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hunted those seeds and found the male
and I made the F3.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they were already F2 when I received
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So luckily I already had that tray locked
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense because I noticed that on
the website you spoke about how there was
[SPEAKER_02]: all these various breeders who'd work had
gone into this line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned Capuletor and Harry Palms
and Rato and Oni and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I noticed any mention of
obsolete.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that where the orange apricot line
came from?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was obsolete.
[SPEAKER_05]: I made the original orange apricot clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe Capuletor found a male about
it from his original seed stock and
[SPEAKER_05]: planted the Legend OG cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: So he made the F1 and he made the F2 from
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it was an orange apricot from
obsolete's original release.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what sort of characteristics can
people expect your male to bring to
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it bring that sort of apricot esque
flavor you mentioned?
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the male is very dominant.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the crosses I found that were heavy
orange apricot dominant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything just came out.
[SPEAKER_05]: All that said, unfortunately, everything
you find would be very apricot orange
[SPEAKER_05]: heavy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The line is pretty old.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's three years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: All the seeds are pretty much sold out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anything you find would be very
apricot orange heavy with kind of like a
[SPEAKER_05]: sativa esque hybrid high with some OG gas
in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's unique for sure, but it's definitely
not my current go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I mean, it sounds like it's got a
little bit of everything in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you ever consider bringing it back,
doing some new crosses with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: like pairing it with the white runs,
for example, or it's had its time and
[SPEAKER_02]: place?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's had its time and place and trying to
move on and focus on new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool, cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next one I wanted to ask you about,
I haven't been able to get anyone to give
[SPEAKER_02]: me any info about this one, but I think
you're going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm probably about to butcher the
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So please forgive me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The acai berry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Acai berry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Acai, damn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 50-50 about whether I was going to
say it the way I said it or the way you
[SPEAKER_02]: said it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems like it's a very tightly held
cut and it seems very popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you describe the flavor and the
high on that one?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a berry kind of very dark
purple, very kind of berry-esque profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why his name Acai, I think the name
is kind of like a dark berry kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: purple cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one of the more mellow jallows as far
as the high as opposed to the others.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it doesn't do as well,
but it's definitely a pretty cultivar to
[SPEAKER_05]: look at.
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of breeds really purple,
purple-esque plants when you call it,
[SPEAKER_05]: when you pull on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely a unique flavor and it's
stable in the Jallow family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, follow on question to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which of the various gelatos is your
personal favorite?
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably the 41, the Bacchia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I got to agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely my favorite.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all different.
[SPEAKER_05]: I select the guava a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: The guava gelato is really fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you manage to come across the acai
berry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I, like, I just don't know anyone
else who's got that besides Shabinsky
[SPEAKER_02]: himself.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just did it from my friend, a Korean
city in SF in Kyoto around the time I did
[SPEAKER_05]: the Jeff Field point back in 2018,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've been working on it for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess as the follow-up, do you feel like
there are any of the gelato cuts,
[SPEAKER_02]: which maybe, you know, aren't the 41,
not your personal favorite, but you think
[SPEAKER_02]: that when you pair them with males,
they produce really nice offspring?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're all good.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all very unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Jallow line is a very unique,
uh, culture of cultivars, which kind of is
[SPEAKER_05]: one of the staples of the last couple of
years, I think.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the 41 is probably the best breed
for sure there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely seen some powerhouses come from
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of powerhouses, anyone who's
been following your Instagram feed would
[SPEAKER_02]: have seen some amazing looking photos of
the baby Yoda feno of the Khalifa mince.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you able to give us a little bit of a
backstory on that one?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a pair that I got from my
friend in LA, Pure and Proper.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's one that I selected for the menu
that, um, it's a menthol by Khalifa Kush.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, um, kicked out, uh,
cultivar, heavy chrysanthemum coverage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of got like a soapy, gassy,
um, profile, um, just around 24,
[SPEAKER_05]: 25% THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very unique, very, um, heavy yield,
very, um, very, very robust cultivar.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really, really amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited to get that one out there next
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that one where like people can
maybe find their own version in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Khalifa mince seed packs, or you think
it's more of like a clone and if they want
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're probably going to need to
track down the clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really think it's a rare feno for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might be able to find some similar
versions in the seeds, but I doubt you'll
[SPEAKER_05]: find the same one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: All released about 100 packs of original
Khalifa mince seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're definitely rare also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there you go guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like you're going to have to get the
clone itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I read on, I think it was your
Instagram post that originally you wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to name it after Mickey Mouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But Disney's a bit litigious.
Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think baby Yoda is a dope name for
a cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see a lot of reasons though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See if, uh, old George Lucas comes in
hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully not.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, speaking of IG, it's, we're kind of
going through an interesting period at the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's been a lot of company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Companies that have been having issues
with IG, removing their posts,
[SPEAKER_02]: censoring them, banning them, all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost seems like you have to say like
10 times in a post these days,
[SPEAKER_02]: like not for sale, not for sale,
not for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it on face value, it seems to me like
your Instagram is doing really well with
[SPEAKER_02]: the marketing and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any tips or do you feel like
it is very hindering and it's just all
[SPEAKER_02]: about how you play the game sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that there'll ever be some
way forward where people can exist on the
[SPEAKER_02]: social media platforms and not be
harassed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the thing that I noticed the most is
that it seems like most of the companies
[SPEAKER_02]: that are sort of having them censored and
having stuff removed seem to be legal
[SPEAKER_02]: companies in legal environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like, at what point are
you going to leave us alone?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think it'll change eventually.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we're in this kind of weird
timeframe where it's quasi-legal in some
[SPEAKER_05]: states and not really federally legal
around all states.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think once the changes, more
companies accepted nationwide and becomes
[SPEAKER_05]: more publicly accepted, you'll see more
changes and more, more acceptance on
[SPEAKER_05]: social media.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just hope so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a few times throughout our chat,
you've mentioned, um, that you're hoping
[SPEAKER_02]: to release cuts or that cuts are released.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this is going to be one of
the ways in which breeders operate moving
[SPEAKER_02]: forward, where they don't only sell seeds,
but they start to get cuts out to either
[SPEAKER_02]: clone dispensaries or like they,
they contract them to various parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something you see gaining
popularity going forward?
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a huge, the market moving
forward is we have more legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think people want those breeder cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a huge market moving forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important to have your stuff clean
and T.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: and verified the disease for you and clean
up where you start.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, kind of a bit of a left of field
question, but I was just curious to ask
[SPEAKER_02]: you, would you ever consider trying to
develop a strain specifically that's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like on the larger yielding side?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think that sometimes you often
hear people talk about how they love
[SPEAKER_02]: exotics, but the yields are always like,
you know, something you got to take into
[SPEAKER_02]: consideration when growing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you ever try to reinvent Blue Dream
and bring some new sort of piece to the
[SPEAKER_02]: game that's just also big yielding?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would really be getting Runts Cross,
I think one of the drawbacks from Runts is
[SPEAKER_05]: people complain about its yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's one of the traits you
can improve with Runts, and you'll see it
[SPEAKER_05]: over the coming years is improved Runts
Caldor is a really strong potency and
[SPEAKER_05]: yield, but with the Runts Turpian Profile
from the original Cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you describe the Runts Turpian
Profile?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say that it smells like a
mixture of Gelato and Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like it's more nuanced than
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, sometimes you hear people
describe Skittles as having like a sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: soapiness to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever pick up on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think that's the same sort of
soapiness that people describe in other
[SPEAKER_02]: strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they're sort of different ones?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't taste any soapiness in Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more like a grapefruity, kind of like
a really unique gravy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so flavorful.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really amazing in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you have any predictions as to what
might be the next big flavor profile to
[SPEAKER_02]: take the scene by Storm?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, it's a hard one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everyone seems to be on a quest to
find the old Skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's going to be lost,
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know Gaslight is a staple this year here
in the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it just revolves with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you just raised a brilliant
little topic of discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many people are currently trying very hard
to find or bring back the Roadkill Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that something you ever had any
interaction with?
[SPEAKER_02]: And or would you ever be interested in
trying to track that one down yourself?
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't had any.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to find some, but it's a holy
grail.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of hard to find.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone seems on the quest for it,
but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say that profile might be lost,
but hopefully not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a bit of a random aside question,
would you ever consider doing any CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I noticed that although there are
breeders out there who do work with CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: you never see like cookies CBD crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something you might be interested
in looking at or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not particularly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I'm actually working on some CBD
stuff right now with some partners in
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do some CBD lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: With some existing cultivars from compound
basically taking some of the compounds,
[SPEAKER_05]: staples and favorites and hitting them
with some CBD males.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is using type two and type three
products next year for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of females jumped to mind for
you from your collection that you think
[SPEAKER_02]: would blend well into that project?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like some jokers and some high
society, some apples and bananas as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some staples, some of my classic ones and
blend them with the CBD and it makes some
[SPEAKER_05]: unique crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's some exciting stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: To jump over to kind of a more community
topic, I think a few years ago might have
[SPEAKER_02]: been 2018, might have been 2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I saw you guys had a booth at one
of the events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it Emerald Cup or am I mistaken?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your thoughts on the current state
of the sort of events we have?
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like there's been a bit of a
changing attitude amongst like the real
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders and real hardcore enthusiasts
since REC was introduced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And notably we've heard a lot of people
say that they're feeling like,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, the Emerald Cup hasn't quite
been the same as in prior years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you share that sentiment and what do
you think would be the future of these
[SPEAKER_02]: events?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we expect to see compound at these
events?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's definitely changed
since realisation for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're definitely more mainstream now,
but I think they're here to stay.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think as you see COVID kind of fade
away or become more under control.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as the events come back,
I think they're huge and they play a big
[SPEAKER_05]: role going forward as mainstream.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's see how that's like one of the
premier ones only through the third year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if it got to the point, because I
think in some states it's now the case
[SPEAKER_02]: that like it's really hard or even not
possible to sell seeds at the events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you still go to the events if you
weren't able to sell seeds or do you feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like there's got to be some sort of give
and take with the breeders themselves?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd still go to the events for sure,
just to see some friends and to kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: socialise, but I think you should be able
to sell seeds and sell a flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a big downfall into their
full potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: New question we don't really talk about
too much, but I've noticed that many
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders seem to have interesting like
side hobbies, side passions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some people are really into
craft beer, some people are into their
[SPEAKER_02]: like motor cars, some people are into
breeding dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a little side hobby you're
particularly fond of?
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, I kind of breathe the eat
and sleep of this every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of passionate about my work too
much, so much to my downfall.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to get into some more products,
but right now I'm all compound all the
[SPEAKER_05]: day, every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm bringing a new question into the
game because we've asked a few breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: this and I'm going to make it a new
staple.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your favourite food?
[SPEAKER_05]: Luminous food, hummus and falafel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And garbanzo and stuff, like the whole
Mediterranean, Middle Eastern food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Habibi, you should come see me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm down to it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude, Lebanese is the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll bring the apples and bananas for
dessert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a date.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm down to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, well, this brings us to the final five
questions, which we like to ask all
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, first one is, what's the most
memorable weed you've ever smoked?
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably that dog shit or the lavender
from somewhere when I was in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_05]: My two favourites, for sure.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there a strain out there where
everyone you knew was like hyping it up,
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about how good it was,
and then you finally tried it and you were
[SPEAKER_02]: like, this isn't that good?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no offence of capital, but the Mac
is the one that comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one does tend to polarise a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually really like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, I've only tried it like
from Mac and Skunk Tech, who are both
[SPEAKER_02]: really good growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that there's a lot of people
who maybe don't quite do it justice when
[SPEAKER_02]: they're growing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's really cultivating something
that lives up to the hype as far as the
[SPEAKER_05]: return profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a really weird profile,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like orange juice and incense mixed
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's so weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but no offence of capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's my friend and he's a good worker and
I just saw my cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I'm sure it's nothing he hasn't
heard before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chill, chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next question is, I'm about to drop you
off at a desert island where you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to spend the rest of your days there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take three strains of weed with
you that you have to grow forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: What three strains are you taking?
[SPEAKER_02]: What three clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can take seed stock if you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: White Runts, Jetsil Gelato, and probably
Dogshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice little mix there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Opposite end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're about to drop someone off to an
island.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not particularly fond of this
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: What three strains are you going to leave
them with on the island?
[SPEAKER_05]: All the same strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very diplomatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So final question, if you could go back in
time to any place throughout history,
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere around the world, you can just,
you've got a time machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take you wherever you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the goal is you're going to collect
either some seeds or some cuttings or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you going?
[SPEAKER_02]: When?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are you collecting?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to spend more time in the
Hashish region of Middle East and explore
[SPEAKER_05]: the Hashish strains of Afghanistan and
Middle East, Pakistan, Morocco.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really get involved in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always a dream of mine to be involved in
the Hashish and see the traditional
[SPEAKER_05]: methods and be immersed in the old ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, dude, we need to go do
the Silk Road together.
[SPEAKER_02]: What an experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be so lush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that is an amazing answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that just about brings us to the
end of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there any shout outs or comments you
wanted to make in general?
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout outs to the Runs Crew, Nip Runs,
Burner Crew, Nodes Labs, my friends,
[SPEAKER_05]: DSG Labs, Turpogs Labs, Scotty,
