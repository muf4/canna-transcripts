[SPEAKER_03]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
The Podcast, a cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_03]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: This episode, as always, was brought to
you by 420 Australia, your premier store
[SPEAKER_03]: for 420 lifestyle and apparel,
as well as Organic Gardening Solutions,
[SPEAKER_03]: your one-stop shop for organic gardening
needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This episode, we're grateful to be joined
by Inspector, who's the head of two
[SPEAKER_03]: companies, as well as a true veteran of
the scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get set for some counter history,
breeding tips, and what you can expect in
[SPEAKER_03]: the future from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty, a big thank you and welcome to a
man who heads not only one, but two
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding companies, Inspector of CSI
Humboldt and Pirates of the Emerald
[SPEAKER_03]: Triangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first question, I like to ask all
breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your introduction to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely a second generation,
you know, grower, breeder, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad, you know, started way back in the
70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was growing indoors in the late 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he showed me his grow rooms
back when I was a little kid, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: was smoking my face when I was a little
bit young.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't remember that,
but, you know, passed me the joint when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was nine, 11, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I was definitely a water
and plants by the time I was eight years
[SPEAKER_01]: old.
[SPEAKER_01]: For my uncle, not so much my dad on that
one, but yeah, I started pretty young.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do you remember any of the strains
that were like, you know, when you can
[SPEAKER_03]: first kind of remember things because
obviously you're not going to remember at
[SPEAKER_03]: eight, but, you know, like maybe when you
were 14, 15, do you remember what they
[SPEAKER_03]: were growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I was 18, the very first
cutting my dad gave me was Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_01]: that he had got from some of his buddies
who I think brought it down from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Seattle area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that, he had the strain,
not strain, but he had this cutting that
[SPEAKER_01]: had come from either the Portland or
Seattle area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the early 80s, I'm thinking like
somewhere between 82 and 84.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, he swears to this day that it's
the best stuff ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I remember when I was, I don't know,
I was pretty young.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometime between eight and 10,
he opened up his hidden grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it was the most gorgeous,
just 16 Kush plants in this six foot by
[SPEAKER_01]: six foot room under a thousand watt metal
halide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, to this day, you know,
I'm looking for something that looks as
[SPEAKER_01]: gorgeous as that, you know, definitely
something Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that he received as a no name plant
from, you know, the Portland, Seattle
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he was told it was bred for 80 degrees
and 80% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is where it gets a little weird,
but he always harvested it at 28 days
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But outdoors, it wasn't even ready until
like mid November, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, so, you know, with that said,
it was a no name strain, but roughly about
[SPEAKER_01]: 1989, I think, he got this other cutting
after he'd lost that first one from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cave junction area in Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this plant kind of looked halfway
between an OG Kush and a Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this cutting was called Uriah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me that plant in the mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I held it along with, you know,
cousins and family and friends up until
[SPEAKER_01]: the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that's another one of those
ones that just got lost to time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it smelled and tasted exactly how weed
is supposed to smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anytime something, anything comes even
close to it, it's like, oh, that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: keeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ones that have come closer, like my Bubba
S1 bomb threat, Irene, like a phenotype of
[SPEAKER_01]: purple dog, purple dog bud, which is Urkel
times Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even some of the like triangle Kush
times Urkels, they hit that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just that is what weed is supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, just from my earliest
memories anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just touched on so many points we'll
have to dive into.
[SPEAKER_03]: First one, do you think that that strain,
which, you know, you kind of hold as the
[SPEAKER_03]: benchmark, do you think that was a
predecessor to, you know, the Bubbas and
[SPEAKER_03]: the Urkels and all that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think it was the other way
around, like it had already been blended
[SPEAKER_03]: together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was definitely, I wouldn't say it
was a predecessor, but I would say that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, possibly some of the OGs and
Bubbas and stuff, maybe just share
[SPEAKER_01]: certain, you know, lineages, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this might be wrong, but when,
if we just go back to how you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you said at 18, you got to see the
grow room and you saw, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the 16 Kush plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that the defining moment for you where
you kind of were like, this is for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was a defining moment,
but, you know, I think I was casual.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was honestly, I was casual into the
growing from the time I was 18 until the
[SPEAKER_01]: time I was about 20, I guess 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I kind of had to make a decision,
you know, pursue, you know, a real world
[SPEAKER_01]: job like I was doing, or, you know,
go full-time grown and well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what was the first strain you bred
and what caused you to decide to breed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, you know, growing between 94
and the early 2000s, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was definitely, you know,
accidental things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, you know, me and friends and
family started the seeds and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then around 2002, I had kind of a,
a little mutant activity going on with a
[SPEAKER_01]: purple oracle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this 12,000 watt room and I had
roughly, I think, nine, maybe it was 108
[SPEAKER_01]: plants of oracle and a couple other things
in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the purple oracle's branches
basically turned full male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you got over a hundred plants and
they're all females except for this one
[SPEAKER_01]: branch and it turned totally male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I took that male branch and I
pollinated a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of stuff with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pollinate oracle, made oracle S1s,
made train wreck oracles, and a handful of
[SPEAKER_01]: other oracle hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew a, me and my cousin and,
you know, some other folks grew a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds out and I, there was killer
stuff in those seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was about two years before I got
on online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came online in 2004 and then I really
started, you know, learning like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, oh wait, you can turn them into
males, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it sounds like things were fairly
self-directed.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that being said though, were there
any breeders you were keeping your eye on
[SPEAKER_03]: at that point and thought like,
Oh, I liked the stuff these guys are
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before 2004, I mean, I'm just a Emerald
triangle kid living in the backwoods of
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt and Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, we didn't have, I didn't
have internet myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until roughly around 2004.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I didn't even know what a
breeder was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So did you, did you just work with your
own stock from year to year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the stuff I inherited from my dad and
his friends and other friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we fast forward, I think it was
in mid 2000s, you decided to start CSI or
[SPEAKER_03]: was it even after that in like 2010 maybe?
[SPEAKER_01]: I started CSI three years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, was it 2014?
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I read.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm breeding a lot of
the same stuff that I bred over 10 years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, but yeah, I didn't, yeah,
I didn't start the company and start
[SPEAKER_01]: retailing until three years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I guess a question some people
might be wondering is why did it kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: take you so long to get into the
commercial game?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, I was, I was just
growing my outdoor crops and just going on
[SPEAKER_01]: vacations and having fun for a good bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, every time I checked
into it, I looked into doing the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: seed thing and every time it was just
like, you got to sell them overseas in UK
[SPEAKER_01]: or Spain or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even legally getting the money,
you know, for them, it was, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just like, nah, too risky for me
at the time anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I guess just to have a
distinction, what was the reason for
[SPEAKER_03]: starting Pirates of the Emerald Triangle?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why did you want to have the two
separate brands for people who aren't
[SPEAKER_03]: aware, ones for the feminized line,
ones for the regular line, but did you
[SPEAKER_03]: just kind of get the idea that,
or the feeling that like they wouldn't gel
[SPEAKER_03]: together as a brand, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to be honest, I always wanted to do
Pirates of the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of, you know, the name of,
you know, my buddies and me and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just what we did around Humboldt
and Trinity and Mendocino even.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I started up a seed company,
like my closest friends and my ex,
[SPEAKER_01]: they liked CSI Humboldt over Pirates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't think Pirates was marketable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay, I'll just go with
Pirates or CSI, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, as time went on,
I was like, well, I still kind of want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, do my original, you know,
idea of Pirates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just kind of segregated them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we just kind of jump back to a
while ago, you mentioned the Bomb Threat
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubba.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is interesting, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Archive also uses this one as a mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long has that one been around for?
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually was under the impression,
I'm probably wrong, but I thought Fletcher
[SPEAKER_03]: popped that one, but it was you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprouted, it wasn't even a large seed
pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprouted 20 of my Bubba Kush S1 seeds
back in 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically from the same breeding that
Obama Kush came from, that my buddy
[SPEAKER_01]: popularized up in Portland, Seattle and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I popped 20 seeds and it was,
weirdly enough, it was my first seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite commercial plant of the bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had kind of like a lemon-lime,
you know, type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite plant out of that bunch was
this Lemon Heads Candy Bubba S1,
[SPEAKER_01]: the number 12, but nobody could grow it
after the first seed run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was just a horrible plant to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everybody who I gave it to lost it
real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bomb Threat, though, it ended up
sticking around and people liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even keep it for a long time,
so I probably didn't have it for two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I realized everybody I'd given it
to still had it and absolutely loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the reason a lot of people think
Archive sprouted it is because I entered
[SPEAKER_01]: Bomb Threat flowers that I grew in,
I think, 2013 through Archive Seed Bank,
[SPEAKER_01]: through Fletcher's company, and then it
won third place at the high time show that
[SPEAKER_01]: it was entered at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, even though I grew it,
he got kind of the credit for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, bummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no worries there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, in terms of the Bubba,
if we want to dive a little deeper into
[SPEAKER_03]: it, a question I always get asked is like
comparing the Bubba to the Oregon Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if you're familiar with it,
but a lot of people like hint that maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubba comes from Oregon Afghani,
but I always got the impression it was the
[SPEAKER_03]: other way around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any kind of opinions on that
one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly think more than likely the
Oregon Afghani comes from Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then on the flip side, you know,
the Oregon Afi could be its own thing
[SPEAKER_01]: because there are a lot of plants around
the Emerald Triangle that have that
[SPEAKER_01]: similar, you know, look and it's just old
Afghani type plant, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do you know much about the history
of Bubba before, you know, Matt or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if that is the truth,
are you kind of going on at this point?
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to believe the story as far as Matt
and Josh, Josh D.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we use that as a bit of a segue,
I got told the other day that someone was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, oh, the OG that Josh brought to the
scene was Ghost OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, no, I thought that was
Triangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, oh, yeah, they're the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I thought they were
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a little bit complicated,
but the way I read it is there,
[SPEAKER_01]: what Matt brought from Florida is a bag
seed, I would assume most likely from
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine a Triangle Kush S1 that they
brought, you know, over to the Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: California area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the Ghost is basically just the
cut that, you know, Josh or them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, their people sold to Oregon Kid
who sold to Ghost, which it's weird
[SPEAKER_01]: calling it Ghost, even though it's really
just the Josh D cut, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the Matt Burgers cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not the S1, you don't think,
or it may be?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as like S1 of TK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would imagine it's an S1 because
that's the way the story, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: plays out as far as Matt Burger saying,
you know, they got some seeds in a bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I've met a lot of people
who, you know, grew or bought Triangle
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush back in Florida around the whole
Orlando area and the greater Florida area,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, back in the mid or late early
90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it definitely was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, that seems to make sense to me
because the Triangle to me, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have really any hints of lemon in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Ghost is quite similar in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how did we make that jump from there
to the, you know, like the real heavy
[SPEAKER_03]: lemon pine OGs we have now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like commonly, I hear the idea that it was
S1s led to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can totally believe that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the one thing I struggle to grasp is
where did all that lemon come from?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just struggle to believe it was
recessively in the TK, as I think maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: some kind of lemon male came into the
story, for example, maybe to make like SFV
[SPEAKER_03]: or something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, kind of take it like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I S1 Bubba, I mean,
you know, you don't hear anybody saying
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubba tastes like lemon lime or,
you know, lemon heads candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, just out of a simple 20 pack,
you know, I pulled both those types out.
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy grew out 35 just a couple of
years ago of my fresh batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he found, you know, a lemon lime one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also found one that was just super
fruity, just like, you know, berries and
[SPEAKER_01]: such, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of stuff hiding in S1s,
you know, or even S2s that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: come out, you know, when you grow out,
you know, the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, it's not it.
[SPEAKER_01]: S1s are never replicas of the mother cup,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just as a general question,
I was thinking about it last night and I
[SPEAKER_03]: was kind of struggling to find a clear
example of where there was an S1 that was
[SPEAKER_03]: better than the original plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was wondering, do you can you think
of anything that jumps to mind where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: an S1 that's clearly better than the
parent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, most people who smoke bomb
threat think it's better than its parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got Mendocino purples S1s that are
definitely better than the parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown Urkel S1s that are better than
the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most most lines so far that I've done,
you know, definitely have individuals that
[SPEAKER_01]: are easily better than, you know,
the parent tissue.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and do you think that comes down to the
quality of the breeding?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like does good feminizing practices affect
the end quality of the seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was actually just listening to
your podcast with Matt Riot on some
[SPEAKER_01]: feminine stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I I'm one of the firm believers that I
do not think you can change the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter how the feminine seeds are
created.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if it's accidental, I think if
it's, you know, on purpose, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: STS clear little silver, you know,
gibberellic acid, I think you're always
[SPEAKER_01]: going to create the same exact seeds no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really can't change base DNA genetics,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But OK, you know, I live in the backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, what do I know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, like, I mean, with that being
said, do you think then that we should try
[SPEAKER_03]: to avoid the stigma around like hermeseed,
so to speak, because something I've always
[SPEAKER_03]: noticed is people will call like,
let's say bag seed, you know, so that's
[SPEAKER_03]: like unintentional.
[SPEAKER_03]: Male flowers on a female causing seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people will call bag seeds S1,
but then they'll also call like a properly
[SPEAKER_03]: made feminized seed in S1.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always thought, you know,
should should we call them the same or
[SPEAKER_03]: call them different?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess in your mind, they're the same
thing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just no difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing with bag seeds that throws
a shadow of doubt is there there's always
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three opportunity, you know,
options really.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be feminized hybrids,
you know, one plant hermed onto another or
[SPEAKER_01]: they could be random stray pollen from a
male plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really don't know with bag seed 100
percent unless you really know your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you know, and you're responsible for
those bag seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's from some random bag, you never
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are there any clones that you've worked
with that you would consider to be like
[SPEAKER_03]: really highly recessive and maybe not
ideal for feminizing in that they might
[SPEAKER_03]: make some all right S1s and the quality of
the S1s is really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as soon as you put that pollen onto
another plant, it just the results aren't
[SPEAKER_03]: as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know if I've even ever
thought about that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times I don't even point people
to S1s particularly because most S1s in my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, you know, tend to have like 40
or 50 percent like recessive genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the S1s, you end up with
generally close to 50 percent of the
[SPEAKER_01]: population just being weak and inbred.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely get some strong,
you know, good quality plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's all with just pure S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like a throw away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times, feminized hybrids work
better with an out cross than they do with
[SPEAKER_01]: an S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not exactly the question,
but, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I kind of like the follow up to
that is a lot of people will often kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: say that the plant that's being turned
into the dome at the pollen donor will
[SPEAKER_03]: tend to be more dominant in the cross as a
rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you find that's the case or it's still
just down to the individual plant if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like a dominant plant in crosses and it
kind of regardless of if it's the donor
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely varies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is something I definitely want to
work on more myself because I've done a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of opposite crosses like where you
take, say, you reverse Bubba Kush and you
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate Purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other times you reverse Urkel and you
pollinate Bubba Kush, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the breeders like, say,
Sam Skunkman, you know, he'll say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they come out the same,
but, or he'll avoid the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, I don't know, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I really want to run out like
large hundred or thousand lots of these
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds of these reverse crosses because
even on the small level I've done them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it almost seems like they
produce different results depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely variable, but I don't
know if I can fully answer that question
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I definitely would have to
disagree with Sam on that one for a few
[SPEAKER_03]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm pretty sure DJ is short
throughout the idea that he said,
[SPEAKER_03]: I always prefer the more sativa of the two
plants in my cross to be the female.
[SPEAKER_03]: So straight away, like he's agreeing that
there is something to that idea and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not just irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then more so, I was thinking about
that myself because I've kind of toyed
[SPEAKER_03]: with that idea myself with just some kind
of pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I found that I definitely got better
results doing it one way than the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it got me thinking, well,
was it the case that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the way that worked well was the way
that's better?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was it just the case that when I did it
and I got good results, I just did a
[SPEAKER_03]: better male selection that run.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the results came out better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's I think there definitely needs to
be some more scientific, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: regimens to, you know, say yay or no on
that question for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, I mean, if we just kind of jump to
a bit of a different topic for a moment,
[SPEAKER_03]: we were talking about the Urkel before for
some people, at least the Urkel is like
[SPEAKER_03]: the oldest cut they have in their library.
[SPEAKER_03]: When did you get the Urkel?
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a follow up, what's the oldest cut
you've got in your library?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Urkel around 2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pretty much the whole family and
everybody I knew had this Urkel,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, around that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the number one most popular strain
in California and beyond, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for a good five plus years there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oldest cut I still have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The humble snow or the snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that back in, I think, 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a bunch of older cuts, but I lost
all of those in 2002.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the snow is the oldest one I
still have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I read a post from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you've already made the snow
hybrids and they're about to be released
[SPEAKER_03]: soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I remember like when you very first
started doing it, you were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, yeah, I'm making these hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think people will be so interested
in them, but I'm just doing them for me
[SPEAKER_03]: mostly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you think people will be interested
in the snow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, do you think it's like not really
desirable compared to today's stuff or?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not fancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it ain't no purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ain't no, you know, gelato or,
you know, wedding cake, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not all these designer, you know,
hyped up things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just old school, you know,
stuff that you take one to hit too many
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the late 90s and you're puking in
the gutter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how would you describe it for someone
like me, for example, who's never had pure
[SPEAKER_03]: snow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is it kind of like a sweet strain?
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks pretty frosty on your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just describe it as like a frosty hash
plant, a little bit piney, skunky,
[SPEAKER_01]: hashy, just kind of old school flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And originally the snow actually I guess
came from the Eugene area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've even heard it potentially
being related, possibly like a sister cut
[SPEAKER_01]: to Trinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, both of those possibly
related to Fourway.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just, you know, things that I'd
like to iron out with some folks and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually see if any of that pans out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Trinity is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think we've ever really spoken
about it on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing which caught my eye is
besides, you know, like the ambiguity of
[SPEAKER_03]: the genetics and the name or whatever,
a lot of people comment like it's gone
[SPEAKER_03]: downhill over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it throws nanners apparently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people say the flavor is not
quite what it used to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always interested in cuts that have
degraded versus cuts that haven't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you consider it to be one that's
really degraded?
[SPEAKER_03]: And would you still work with it,
I guess?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've never flowered out the pure
Trinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've recently been given a cut of Trinity
that may or may not be the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seem to, you know, it definitely looks
like what I know of as the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely one that has potential
for, you know, S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, if it actually came from
Fourway, then Fourway might actually be a
[SPEAKER_01]: better bet to, you know, dig into and see
what's in the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we just jump back to the Urkel
we were talking about in a moment,
[SPEAKER_03]: do you have any ideas about what the
genetics may be?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've heard Mad Pharma speculate that on
the father's side, it was maybe a
[SPEAKER_03]: predecessor to Northern Lights 2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know anything along those lines?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or anything in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've always heard since early on
after I got it, there was a couple things
[SPEAKER_01]: I was told when I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that came off of Bell Springs Road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bell Springs Road is basically a back
road between Humboldt County, Garberville,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I honestly, I want to dig up
Tom Hill one of these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he's still alive, I'm pretty sure he
is, but you know, because a lot of his
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics came from this cat named the
chemist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of almost wonder if this
chemist isn't responsible for Urkel or
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't, you know, once or twice removed
from somebody who's responsible for this
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people said that it was a
Pakistani chemist Danny times skunk number
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of like, you know,
almost common knowledge, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: around Southern Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so could be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm running out a bunch of pine tar
cushions right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are definitely a lot of plants
that resemble Urkel S1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you tell us about Tom Hill in
general?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know if you're aware,
Mean Gene last episode said that the
[SPEAKER_03]: chemist is Tom Hill's dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you knew that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other cool thing to that is,
is anyway, what can you tell us about the
[SPEAKER_03]: pine tar project?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some photos on your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hard one to come across.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a few packs of X18 and they didn't
germ.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was mighty impressed when you got,
I think you said 230 out of 300 or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the goal with the pine tar and
what can you tell us about Tom Hill in
[SPEAKER_03]: general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just to recap on the pine tar cush,
so last time I actually saw Tom in person
[SPEAKER_01]: was a couple of years ago at the Golden
Tarp Awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he promised me he had a thousand seeds
left of the pine tar cush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told him, you know, the work I was
doing at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, oh, you know,
I'll give you my last thousand and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do a big open pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, everybody I know and you
know, who knows Tom, including myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's pretty much dropped off, you know,
the weed grown planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I was, I was left to
basically round up just a bunch of pine
[SPEAKER_01]: tar cush seeds from, you know,
the community essentially, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But wait, did I lose the question?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what do you hope to ultimately
get out of the PTK project?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's a quality, pure,
pure Indica line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, the thing I've been doing for
the last few years, at least, is just
[SPEAKER_01]: preserving and reproducing all these,
you know, just pure lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done, you know, Colombians,
Burmese, the Pakistani strals,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the pine tars now, a handful of
others.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's for future work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do you think it compares to his
other strains?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had a few people say that they've
heard the pine tar pretty much blows most
[SPEAKER_03]: of his other work out of the water,
especially the deep chunk, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting because it, you know,
it's got such a cult following because it
[SPEAKER_03]: looks so cool and it's pretty interesting,
but at the same time, it's pretty bland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A deep chunk by itself is definitely
boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's good qualities to deep
chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reproduced that one as well from some of
his old 2003 stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pine tar, yeah, definitely is one
of the ones out of his lines that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, has definitely been one I've
been wanting to preserve for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The X-18 as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown a little bit of that out a
couple times and every time it produces
[SPEAKER_01]: some really nice just, you know,
land-race style plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, nothing that, you know, people really
want these days, you know, but stuff to
[SPEAKER_01]: build on.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, I remember watching your interview
with Kevin Jodry and you mentioned that
[SPEAKER_03]: the OGKB Pheno comes out in Urkel S1s
about 10% of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, with that being said, do you feel like
there's a bit of Urkel in OGKB or just a
[SPEAKER_03]: common lineage between the two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I definitely think that some part of,
if they're telling the truth and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, the Cookies family,
I definitely think there's some Urkel in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Durban F1, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, do you think that that is the
case?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, do you think they really know what
they've got?
[SPEAKER_03]: I get the feeling they probably don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, yeah, that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might or they might not, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got buddies down in Mendo who have
known them since they were kids and most
[SPEAKER_01]: of those guys think they don't know
exactly 100% what they have or what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, maybe a more underlying
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think, even though they may not
know what it is, do you think they were
[SPEAKER_03]: the ones where like operating the room
where the seed was originally conceived or
[SPEAKER_03]: the alternative story is they got bags of
it and then they were just the ones who
[SPEAKER_03]: popped it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're probably responsible for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's more, you know, folks like me
and Jane, you know, down in Mendo would
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely know more about that than,
you know, where I was up in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the back of the Trinity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the other little popular idea at the
moment is that some common ancestry of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies or possibly even just the straight
parent, you know, that's an S1 is the
[SPEAKER_03]: cherry pie Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any opinions on that one,
whether it is possibly in the,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the bloodline?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cherry pie is supposed to be a
granddaddy purple times Durbin F1 or
[SPEAKER_01]: something to that effect, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the one that is kind of getting
touted at the moment is actually
[SPEAKER_03]: apparently different to just straight
cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they call it cherry pie Kush,
even though I'm sure cherry pie gets
[SPEAKER_03]: called cherry pie Kush by accident,
but apparently it's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the story that's going around,
especially from the Gage Green crew,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that, you know, Girl Scout cookies is
just an S1 from this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently if you grow this plant,
it's a little bit self-evident.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, I know the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the one Tim Blake was growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the PFA crew.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, Alan, I forget his
name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Atkinson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've heard his story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, with that being said,
just to go back to OGKB, do you think OGKB
[SPEAKER_03]: is like an S1 of Girl Scout cookies or do
you think it's maybe one of the original
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds from the original stock,
which is kind of the other story that goes
[SPEAKER_03]: around?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've always thought,
you know, it was just S1 or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I met this fellow a few weeks back up
in Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: He went by the handle OGKB.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's the guy that, you know,
he's the source of the OGKB clone and he
[SPEAKER_01]: swears up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the original thin man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've read a story for him saying,
and he swears he popped the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I think that's maybe where that,
that second story I mentioned got traction
[SPEAKER_03]: because if he did pop the seed,
well then, yeah, who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, just maybe a last little question
on the cookies thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you ever consider doing like a
cookies S1 project?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I bring this up is
because, you know, you got to give it
[SPEAKER_03]: credit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been around long enough that you kind
of have to consider it like a really elite
[SPEAKER_03]: client.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it stood the test of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, will you ever do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a little bit embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of took a break from the
internet for about three years from 2008
[SPEAKER_01]: to 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I stayed out of, you know,
any, you know, weed this, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoyed a little break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I came back, it was like,
cookies, cookies, cookies, cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what the fuck is this cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, everything was cool when
I left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I come back and there was all this hype
and I was just like, oh hell with this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a cut of the forum, the forum cut of
cookies, grew it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it was nothing special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I grew it out a couple more times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably the third time I grew it out,
it was just like, damn, this is some
[SPEAKER_01]: really fricking good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, it's taken me a few years
to, you know, wrap my head around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm like, if there wasn't all this
hype around the cookies, I would honestly
[SPEAKER_01]: think it is some of the best weed I've
ever, you know, grown and smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of wrapped my head around that
just this last summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care who I'm doing it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually right now I reversed the forum
cut, which is actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: my favorite one that I've grown so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just making me a bunch of,
you know, forum S ones and then hybrids
[SPEAKER_01]: just to, you know, cause every single Girl
Scout cookie hybrid I grow has really good
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though, you know, you definitely
have to weed through, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the unstable ones out of the bunch,
but you know, once you're through that,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's really good quality plants out of
all the ones I've grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what type of female would you
consider ideal to be like the receiving
[SPEAKER_03]: end of the pollen from the Girl Scout?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's the type of plant that
you think pairs well with the Girl Scout?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, right now I don't know because I
haven't, I probably have, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: four or five at most.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think something that is kind of similar
to like the stature of cookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: like an OG Kush or kind of like the old
family purples, the Urkel OGs that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those I think would blend really
well and kind of keep that structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that popcorn look, because my favorite
plants are always popcorn plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: which just, you know, dank nuggets,
you know, along the stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how the old ones I grew up with
were.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you think they got so small?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a bit of a weird question,
like the nuggets, but like I look at all
[SPEAKER_03]: the predecessors that are thrown out there
as possible Girl Scout cookie parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, for example, OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, similar structure, small little
golf bally nugs, but it's like they took a
[SPEAKER_03]: markedly step smaller in the Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, I don't know, it just seems
like an odd trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's probably just recessive genetics
or whatever, but yeah, it just seems odd
[SPEAKER_03]: that they got so small, but so potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, do you have any ideas about how that
happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just selection or lottery ticket
combination type thing or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it could just be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then again, you know, who's to say
because, you know, the form cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is probably the most widespread one
has a small little popcorn nuggets,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the, um, the OG KB and the thin mints,
I don't think whether they're the same or
[SPEAKER_01]: different, they're not as small as,
as the form, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just some form of, you know,
recessive recombinations, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you think maybe it's a,
you know, an S one or possibly S two,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just mentioned S two.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen more breeders come out using S
ones as mothers, but we've even actually
[SPEAKER_03]: started to see people use S twos as
mothers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel there is a risk in doing this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you feel like maybe if you choose to
do it, you just need to test the progeny
[SPEAKER_03]: harder as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're doing so, like what would be
your recommendations as a buyer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you be like buyer beware or no?
[SPEAKER_03]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you definitely, uh, get, um,
more uniform results using S twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or breeding with S ones, you know,
um, so I think the further you get like S
[SPEAKER_01]: one, S two, maybe even S three,
um, you're going to get a tighter and
[SPEAKER_01]: tighter, uh, um, phenotypic, you know,
variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've, I've seen it myself when,
you know, um, I, I do a feminized hybrid,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, with just the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I do a feminized hybrid with the
S one, uh, S one selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phenotypes are a lot tighter and you
know, some of these guys like good old
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam, uh, skunk man, you know, they're,
they're not going to be advertising all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the place, but they've said it,
you know, I mean, those guys are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, breeding stuff to S one,
S two, S three, S four, S five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how they're, you know,
isolating exactly what they want out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but then you got all these
people who are running around being like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, feminize is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, why is the, you know,
guys who have, you know, um, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the broadest, you know, experience in the
game, you know, being like, this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: way you do it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I guess with that in mind,
do you agree with the idea that there is
[SPEAKER_03]: an increased risk of hermaphrodites with
feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, that that's a tough one
because pretty much every single,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, end race I've ever run,
it has plenty of hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even Tom Hills, pine tars,
X 18s, deep chunk, you bring those inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those have, you know, a good
percentage of hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you run out any regular seed,
OG, Kush, chem dog, this, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the other, you give them a certain
level of stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have hermaphrodites, you know,
um, the, the feminized seeds definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: have their share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it definitely gets worse if you take,
uh, extreme hermaphrodite, like say
[SPEAKER_01]: something that breeds strong
hermaphrodites, like Girl Scout cookies
[SPEAKER_01]: and cross it to another extreme
hermaphrodite, you know, like Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies times sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I see companies every day selling
seeds just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, how are they not getting 110%
hermaphrodites, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But people still under certain
circumstances are getting, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: great plants that don't have the
hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Herm problems out of them, even off the
worst hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so maybe this one,
you may not know the answer to it because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's kind of a bit abstract, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in terms of the Girl Scout cookies,
where do you attribute the hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_03]: traits back to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it comes from like a possible
OG side and then it's just been kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: aggravated in this situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely a strong hermaphroditic
trait in OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not even so much that the OG Kush
itself, um, cause I've run tons of
[SPEAKER_01]: different OG Kush clones and I've never
really ever had herm problems out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you breed it, you always get,
you know, anywhere from 10 to 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a, you know, a little tent
with, you know, a bunch of light leaks or
[SPEAKER_01]: hit them with, you know, extreme,
you know, doses of fertility, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to end up with even more than
that, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the OG is definitely a one proponent,
but Girl Scout seems like it might have a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple, couple things in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you, you know how, uh, um,
the, the general recipe Durban F1 times
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida OG is supposed to be Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, I bought a, I bought a little
sack of a Durban F1 off of Cookie Monster
[SPEAKER_01]: down in LA earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, that he pulled it out of this bag
and I ain't seen more bananas in a bag in
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, whoa, that's one herm strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, there's so many
people who are like a part or peripherally
[SPEAKER_03]: a part of Cookie Fam that for me,
it's almost hard to know who's what,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like there's, there's the people
who you would consider the main,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like Burner and his crew,
but now it's almost like, no, no,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, they're not Cookie Fam.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's the Sizzurp guy and you
know, these other Cookie Monster and all
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to me, it's almost just like,
man, it's almost like just so muddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard, it's hard to know what's up,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the core fam is like, uh,
S-flux, uh, capacitor Juga and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and then Burner of course as hype man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like what happened to Pi guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, is he still there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the original stories, they were
saying like, he's the one who knows the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I, I've, I've tried to stay out of it
for so long, but you know, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I have curiosities myself,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I've, I've got some
experience I'd like to be running
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully this winter if things work out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the thing I always thought to myself
is why doesn't someone like just fam,
[SPEAKER_03]: just regular Durban to OG Kush and see
what comes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the, you know, that, that must give
you some hints, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if the F1 part of that Durban F1
is really a mystery, well, maybe doing
[SPEAKER_03]: that cross would maybe help elude or I
don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've, I've, uh, I've run this
Durban for a long time and man,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a hard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I just need to run the OG KB and the
thin mints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I have a hard time seeing a lot of
Durban at all in Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Durban is extremely high
interpenetrating and that's the smell you
[SPEAKER_01]: get out of train wreck, Jack rare,
you know, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that doesn't seem to be a strong
component to Girl Scouts in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This, this may be going to be a bit of a
low and unpopular opinion, but I always
[SPEAKER_03]: found Girl Scout cookies to have like a
certain licoricey aniseed component to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then when I got to smell the Colorado
Durban, um, I was like, this doesn't smell
[SPEAKER_03]: like aniseed at all to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just smells like really sweet and like,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're not getting any licorice,
not getting nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I just smelt that, I would have
been like, I don't think this is a part of
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the most popular clone of Durban going
around the U S is that one in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it's actually everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've gotten multiple cuts of it and
it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, uh, it's just high
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's extremely high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tests it like between four and 5%
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most strains don't even test at 1% for
all their terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certainly pungent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's really, really pungent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a question I was interested in,
probably should have asked it back at the
[SPEAKER_03]: Urkel part.
[SPEAKER_03]: I might even cut it back in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, for me, I was really surprised by how
thin-leafed Urkel is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess just in my mind, I was
expecting it to be a bit more akin to like
[SPEAKER_03]: a bubba because of, you know, like the
real indica medicinal side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that this indicates there's a
lot to be said about thin-leafed Indicas
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know, like where are they now type
thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, I mean, that's a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, uh, back to the, you know,
the, the pine tar cushions that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: running out right now, um, pack and,
and even to go into like the Pakistani
[SPEAKER_01]: chitrolls, um, that I work with and work
with, you know, uh, Viacana Biogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, these are all, you know, Pakistani
Indicas, you know, whether it's pine tar,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the chitrolls or, um,
X-18s or whatever, but all of these are
[SPEAKER_01]: more thin-leafed Indicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not that broad, you know,
uh, hash plant leaf or that deep chunk
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, I've, I've got a, a, a male,
uh, um, pine tar right now that looks
[SPEAKER_01]: almost identical to Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've got another male,
um, that smells just like Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, Ooh, you know, future
projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then would you ever consider maybe
trying to like recreate like Urkel,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, in the sense of using a few
strains, which you saw different
[SPEAKER_03]: characteristics in it, but not ones that
you thought were specifically a part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Urkel makeup.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like a relux type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, um, hearsay has it that,
you know, Urkel is a, a Pakistani times a
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk number one, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I've had UK cheese since oh
five, you know, um, I'm like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: why don't I just take one of these select,
you know, pine tar cushions and cross it
[SPEAKER_01]: to UK cheese and see what pops out,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'd be really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that falls exactly into a
lot of stuff that, you know, really kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of entertains me is I like to recreate
things and see, you know, how things
[SPEAKER_01]: combine and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so last kind of question on the Urkel,
what is the difference between the Urkel
[SPEAKER_03]: and the Mendo perps?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're extremely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the Mendo perps, um, comes from my
buddy down there in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he sprouted the seed back in 1998.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you, I'm, I'm sure you know his
handle, uh, on IG not so dog, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, it came from, he got the seed from
this old man out of Covolo sprouted the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed and you know, it is a very unique
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, um, it, it looks like kind of a,
um, an Afghani type.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has that kind of Afghani broadleafed,
uh, um, look to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've S one did I grew S ones,
you know, back in 2004, um, grew a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of S ones a few years ago of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it doesn't seem like there's
really any sativa in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as far as the S ones go, um,
but there's just a lot of unique terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: just you know, stuff I haven't seen in any
other plants, you know, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it is, sorry, go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's, it's very different than
Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel tends to be a, um, a cold dependent,
like it needs a little cold, a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of cold temperatures, um, to purple up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the Mendo purple, um, it has more
of a natural purple to it, but the S ones
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Mendo purple have an extreme,
uh, percentage of those have an extreme
[SPEAKER_01]: natural purple, almost a black,
just from the start of flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've actually spotted a few photos
of that one on your feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, really dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we just jump topics for a moment,
I wanted to ask you about all the pure
[SPEAKER_03]: cush is going around right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like they've gained a bit of
traction recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, there's like the sugar cut,
um, the LA pure, the top anger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to say it's suburb in
Cali, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, there's all those different
ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard from a few people, oh,
they're similar slash the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the differences and what is it,
when they say pure cush, like to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: it brings like TK to mind, you know,
like, like no lemon, just cush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that kind of what it's like or not
really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm, I'm with you on the whole
pure cush thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my, my, my buddy, uh, got this,
uh, pure cush clone back in 2005 and gave
[SPEAKER_01]: it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it came from Orange County.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some big warehouse grower had paid
$5,000 for the cut and I've had it ever
[SPEAKER_01]: since.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just an OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a good OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of an earthy hashy OG Kush,
no lemon or, you know, all that,
[SPEAKER_01]: no pine saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but a lot of people really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's no relation to the Bubba S
type plant that Shug Night, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: has as, or had as pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then on top of that, there's a
bunch of clubs out of like Malibu or
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever, um, Topanga, Topanga Canyon,
pure cush is that aren't even the same cut
[SPEAKER_01]: as the one I got back in 05.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these didn't even pop up for another,
what, five plus years after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's, it's one of those things
where, you know, you could try to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: it out or you could just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just literally, just to quickly clarify
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think, like, is it the case that
the, uh, the Shug cut is actually from
[SPEAKER_03]: Shug Night?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought it was just like named
after him or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in 04, 05, um, there was this,
um, there was this guy, um, on canvas
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if he was on Overgrow,
but he was, he was heavy on canvas world
[SPEAKER_01]: and he, he, he got this cut, um,
that was originally labeled PK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and he actually called it,
uh, maybe it didn't even have a label
[SPEAKER_01]: because he actually called it Bubba Kush
at first, but then he found out it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: PK and he was calling it, uh, um,
purple Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he was like, no, it's not purple
Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he re-labeled it Piss Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he was like, no, that's not it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, okay, it's pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: They told me now it's pure Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did some breeding with it and blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, he pulled seeds on a canvas world,
you know, via a heaven stairway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it was just a dude who used the
handle Shug Night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing to do with, you know, I figured
that he was too caught up with his shit
[SPEAKER_03]: with Biggie to be brief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, there's, there's still some
cats, I think, who talk with them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cats like, uh, cats like Rude
Boy and, uh, you know, Grow Hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, I'm not sure if he's too much
in the game anymore though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting how so many people have
almost ducked out when it would seem like
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the right time to put your head up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a bit of a, maybe a controversial
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the deal with Purple Punch winning
at Chalice, which is a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_03]: while ago, admittedly, but everyone I've
spoken to says that strain has no potency.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But shit house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it like, it's winning cut,
like Jungle Boys are winning cups with it
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how does that work for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you, do you write it better than what
other people do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all Purple Punch is, is, um,
you know, you, you forget some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: names on them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all it is, is OG Kush times Urkel
essentially, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, and I just grew out,
you know, well over a hundred OG Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: times Urkels, you know, that all the OGs
had different names, but all the Urkel was
[SPEAKER_01]: just the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had Purple Punch phenotypes in there
and what those, those plants are is
[SPEAKER_01]: they're extremely frosty and extremely
pretty and just gorgeous plants with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, decent smells and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, they don't exactly,
you know, have the punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a lot of times when you have a lot of
entries into a cup, um, and people are
[SPEAKER_01]: having to smoke all those entries,
you know, just one after another,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, bag appeal and, you know,
that kind of thing is going to really
[SPEAKER_01]: weigh out a lot on that competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so, and so do you think that
there's almost an inherent flaw in the way
[SPEAKER_03]: that cup judging is done these days in
that, you know, there's just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: the judges are just overload.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for example, we're trying to run a
little cup in Australia at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the rules we're having,
it's all online, but one of the rules
[SPEAKER_03]: we're having is that the judges are only,
only allowed to try one sample each day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so many people have been like,
that's such a good rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it's like, and it just doesn't
seem to make sense why they wouldn't do it
[SPEAKER_03]: in the States.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, is it, is it that poorly
organized that they can't get the samples
[SPEAKER_03]: out early enough?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like, what's the deal just to
commercialize and they don't care about it
[SPEAKER_03]: or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Too many entries a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, really honestly, you got it
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they, they don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, I love the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already know, but how can anyone judge
400, 500, 600 entries in one month?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you, you can kind of break that
down into, you know, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff just not even getting tried.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd have to assume, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's even like, whatever's like hit number
eight or nine of the day is just a blur.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, in general though,
do you get concerned about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I brought this up in a previous
interview, given like seed sales are
[SPEAKER_03]: affected by if Australian wins a cup,
is that not a little bit of concern to you
[SPEAKER_03]: given that things which maybe shouldn't be
winning are winning and likewise things
[SPEAKER_03]: which, you know, you've made, which are
maybe really phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they just get, they, they slip
through the net type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think eventually the real quality
stuff will kind of, you know, rise up and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it just might take a little bit
longer, you know, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a word of mouth style versus,
you know, everybody, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just, Oh, it won a cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, stuff like Irene,
horrible bag appeal, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, nothing to look at at all,
but everybody who smokes it, she's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, who are we?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I wanted to ask you about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the Irene has got a lot of traction
recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, again, archive, he done a few hybrids
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe you have as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's one of the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one was the F cut of OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed that the F cut and the Irene are
quite unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: You work with both of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you like about them and why do you
think we don't see them so much in other
[SPEAKER_03]: people's work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Irene, for example, as extreme,
at least for a long time, she was
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely hoarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, um, uh, a handful of years ago,
I got her, um, from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, via a couple of friends,
um, from, uh, rude boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I just, I didn't even think
nothing of her, you know, I was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I threw her out in my yard,
you know, um, in a 200 gallon bed and grew
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't even until, you know,
late in the fall, about mid, mid,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, September when I was like,
Ooh, what's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause she was just smelling something
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: She didn't look like nothing special all
the way up until there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then, you know, uh, I gave it to,
you know, obsolete, uh, I gave it to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, doctor from archive,
um, and a couple other people with,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, rude boys, you know, permissions,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where, you know, um,
they started making the hybrids with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, um, a little while after I
followed suit, but, uh, um, she's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really good quality smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, she's nothing to look at
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she has this weird mutant trait where,
uh, she grows nuggets on her STEM pedials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you try trimming it and it's like,
Oh, the nugs all fall off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stems when you clip them off and it
is, it's, it's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's, she does have a lot of pros in
those departments, but man, she is some
[SPEAKER_01]: good smoke, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about the F cut the folks,
the F cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, um, I, I, uh, I, I've called it a
faux G Kush, you know, F A U X,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, but, uh, um, early,
early on that came from Dankiest OG from,
[SPEAKER_01]: from icy mag and, uh, you know,
they, they, they called it, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of my buddies named it the F cut
because they were like, Oh, it's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: fake OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So F stood for fake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was just a quality cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the first time I smelled it,
I was like, Ooh, this is some of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: smelling, you know, OG I've ever smelled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, grown, um,
uh, grown by Dankiest himself,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, when I first smelled it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, it definitely breeds a little bit
different than some of the OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a lot of the OGs kind of, um,
breed tall and lanky, just like a normal
[SPEAKER_01]: OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas this one, it breeds kind of
smaller and shorter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what OG cut in your opinion is kind of
the most underrated one, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like what you, I, I personally,
I love Larry and I feel like it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: get enough credit at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never tried the, uh, Larry myself,
I've kind of wanted to, but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, I tend to mostly stick with
the triangle kush just because that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: one I believe is, you know, the one that
started it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I figure if you can, you know,
reverse that one, you should be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: pull out, uh, all the other OG kushes out
of it, you know, um, just S one style.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and when I breed with the
triangle kush, um, compared to the others,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I tend to get, you know, the broadest,
um, spectrum of, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with a lot of these others,
it's like a lot narrower and tighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I was just going to say, I don't know
if it's, you know, underrated at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, my preference for,
for the OGs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what do you think predecessors the
triangle you know, what, what was that
[SPEAKER_03]: strain that, uh, Matt and Josh got the bag
of weed off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, the, the triangle kush,
uh, that I have came, um, came from big
[SPEAKER_01]: Ricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, he, he gave it to, uh, um,
you know, doctor from archive and then doc
[SPEAKER_01]: gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, that, that, um, cut a big
Ricky cornbread Ricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: He claims, you know, he's had that since
1992.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that predates, you know, Matt,
um, Matt and Josh's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: OG and he claims he got it as a cut,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I mean, he's essentially the one to
talk to, but, you know, some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: stories get a little hazy a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, but if you had to speculate,
what do you think the parents of the,
[SPEAKER_03]: of the triangle would have been?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard that, you know, just like some
land raise possibly like we're,
[SPEAKER_03]: how do you, you think now it's a bit more
refined than that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it very well could be just like a
Pakistani, uh, uh, sativa hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to get into the whole
sativa thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, I'm no sativa expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them, but I don't have the time to
grow something that takes 24 weeks yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I'm definitely, uh, definitely
like a Pakistani, uh, sativa, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we just take a jump now from
kind of the female feminized chat over to
[SPEAKER_03]: the regular stuff, you know, let's dive
into the Emerald, uh, parts of the Emerald
[SPEAKER_03]: triangle stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the next project you're looking to
do under that line?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's the next male you're
looking to work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, that's a, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've been toying with a few different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I definitely want to toy around with
some pine tar pine tar Kush hybrids for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, being that I'm spending the time
to, you know, grow out a huge lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to breed directionally
from, from this you know, this lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, we'll see where that
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I might toy around with, uh,
some orange, orange type stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've been talking to some buddies and
we're looking to put together a nice,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, old school orange, uh,
cornucopia, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, um, but, uh,
I don't know, uh, I haven't made any,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, long-term plans quite yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that orange one you just
referenced, I've kind of noticed citrus in
[SPEAKER_03]: general is like orange citrus,
especially is very on the up and up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, even beyond just tangy, we're still
seeing things like, uh, Clementine being
[SPEAKER_03]: used quite regularly in modern crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that in mind, do you think there's
something about the citrus terpenes,
[SPEAKER_03]: which, um, specifically the orange ones,
which allows it to kind of work?
[SPEAKER_03]: As a flavor of the month, more so than
other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I kind of get by that is,
is I find that, um, like, let's just take
[SPEAKER_03]: typical tangy slash Calio type terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find that they're sharp, like a sword,
like they, they cut through things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, if you had a bag and it's
grown well, you could have just one bud
[SPEAKER_03]: of, you know, that type of stuff in there
with a whole bunch of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just, it cuts through the rest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in that regard, I kind of think
like it's good that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a good flavor of the month because
it, it's got these characteristics which
[SPEAKER_03]: suit being flavor of the month.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's really loud and obnoxious
and people get a big blast out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, do you think that that will
persist on beyond this fad because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of like Calio was around and it died
out and then tangy came back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of revitalized it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think we'll fall off again or it'll
stay more present this time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think things kind of move in
circles, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, uh, like the purple
cushions and the purples and the grapes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they had their heyday and then
they fell off and then they had another
[SPEAKER_01]: heyday and then they fell off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think, uh, it's probably,
you know, the same with the oranges and
[SPEAKER_01]: the bananas and the this and that,
that's and the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, me personally, I, I would like to have
all the flavors in a seed form so that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it doesn't matter, you know,
what's popular today or tomorrow or the
[SPEAKER_01]: next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can always just be like,
Oh, well I'll pop, you know, a hundred of
[SPEAKER_01]: those or a hundred of these, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, on one side, I definitely
breed for the public, but on the other
[SPEAKER_01]: side, I'm always breeding for myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so what type of genetic base
would you want to use to kind of get those
[SPEAKER_03]: orange flavors into your cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as far as like the, well, for,
for, for one, um, there, there's a good,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, three or four clones that circulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some of them probably held pretty
tight, um, that are all just extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: orangey old school clones, um,
have been around for 20, 30, 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've already played around a good
little bit with the, the AE 77 Callio
[SPEAKER_01]: Cologne, which dates back to roughly about
1980.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then there's some other ones,
uh, that some, uh, some of, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, my buddies hold that, uh, are
definitely strong orange types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, I'm, I'm working with,
uh, um, some other cats who uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: have some old school, I guess,
uh, you know, orange, uh, um, Callio,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I might, you know, just try
starting there and see where that leads
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you find that some of the current
modern orange hybrids are a little lacking
[SPEAKER_03]: in potency?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, most of the orange strains,
um, seem to be a little lower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, on the potency tip for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I honestly don't think I've come
across anything just, um, super orangey
[SPEAKER_01]: and super potent at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we just jump back to the work
you're going to do, um, with the males,
[SPEAKER_03]: do you want to specifically look to just
breed with heirloom males?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because that's already a trend,
you know, if we look at the previous
[SPEAKER_03]: Pakistani release you did, maybe I should
more ask, do you have, do you have a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: of a thing for Pakistanis?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we got the, the PTK and then
your, your original releases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, can we expect more Pakistanis or maybe
different land races or just modern males
[SPEAKER_03]: even?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I definitely like to lean towards,
uh, um, the heirloom land races,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, um, you know, quality inbred,
uh, um, you know, older lines are
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a potential as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one, one thing, uh, I think,
uh, even just, uh, um, like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: a redux or something, uh, um, I,
I almost think that if you take a,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a strong terpenaline male,
like, uh, I found in the, uh, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Pakistani chitrals, and if you cross
that with, uh, you know, some type of
[SPEAKER_01]: calio, um, I think that terpenaline added
to the orange actually is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients to, um, kind of almost spike
that orange pungency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, through the roof.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a feeling that the terpenes
definitely played some role in that,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially if you consider, like,
if we just both agreed that orange terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: weeds tend to, tend to be a bit lower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's maybe a good indication that
terpenes play some bigger role in that
[SPEAKER_03]: all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a follow-up question to the previous
one I wanted to ask though, is did you
[SPEAKER_03]: ever get like weird questions or funny
looks from people given you called it
[SPEAKER_03]: like, for example, you'd be like,
oh, this is the chem dog effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, the purple F1, because while it was
correct in the naming sense, it is a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit ambiguous for what today's
buyers are used to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while someone who's more experienced
probably wouldn't have an issue with it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some people were probably like,
well, like, is this just pure chem dog or
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, something like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I get tired of the name
game like a lot of us do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, for, for those, um,
I, I almost just wanted to breed them for
[SPEAKER_01]: myself and start from a starting point
where I can just call them F1s,
[SPEAKER_01]: F2s, F3s, F4s, back cross ones,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I figured, you know, if,
if people already are going to name their
[SPEAKER_01]: keeper cuts, whatever they want,
you know, which is kind of commonplace
[SPEAKER_01]: these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just like, I'm just going to get
lazy on this and just F1, just call them
[SPEAKER_01]: all F1s and you know, the, the lineage is
right there on the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, no, no dispute what it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, yeah, I definitely,
there, there was a small handful of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of nitpickers being like, Oh, how can you
call the clone F1?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you know, come up with your own
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care what the name is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an, you see what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just mentioned about people naming
their favorite clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I'm certainly guilty of that myself,
but I think the one little caveat I place
[SPEAKER_03]: on myself is I only do it if I feel the
clone is not only a keeper, but also quite
[SPEAKER_03]: unique from what you would typically get
from that stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's almost like a little bit of its
own thing in a certain regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, but like, it still muddies the
waters because you've got someone like me
[SPEAKER_03]: who's like fanatic about making sure
things are listed correctly and all that,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I, you know, I deal with how muddy
it gets firsthand all the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: but at the same time, I can understand,
you know, like me having a name for
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe if in afterwards I put
brackets, like, you know, whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the actual genetics, um, it might be
confusing for some, especially people who
[SPEAKER_03]: aren't as fanatical, like maybe they just
pick and choose which parts they want to
[SPEAKER_03]: say it is or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that's a practice in general?
[SPEAKER_03]: We should just avoid and find some better
way of, you know, like naming our favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: clones or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think like on the whole,
it's not that damaging, I guess,
[SPEAKER_03]: to the whole name game, considering where
we're at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it definitely gets tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm, I'm a nitpicker myself when
it comes to lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And history and change in names and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, yeah, I mean, I, I,
I grew up with that kind of stuff where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, early on we, you know,
there was a train wreck and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, five years later, somebody else
is calling something different train
[SPEAKER_01]: wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, you know, give out
hundreds, if not thousands of clones and
[SPEAKER_01]: all of a sudden everybody, you know,
knows that they're cut as train wreck,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas we knew something else as train
wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the name game is, is, it's definitely
tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, there's, there's no right
answer to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just out of curiosity, um,
in a previous episode, Bob Hemphill
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned he's had train wreck so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's just like so over it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like so sick of the Tert profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Has that happened to you as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: He says it happens to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, um, I definitely go, don't almost
ever go for my, my train wreck bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, I, I still, you know,
have sentiment, you know, sentimentality,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that word for, for train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was one of the earlier ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think I got it in like 99.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we were buying sacks of it,
you know, back in 1994, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, it was actually different than the
99 one, but you know, um, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, yeah, you can definitely get tired of
some things, but I try not to throw the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones I like to away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he actually expressed a similar
sentiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what I would be interested in knowing
though is what do you think the genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: are of train wreck?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause everyone, I feel like it's almost
people don't want to guess because they're
[SPEAKER_03]: like, Oh, well, you know, train wreck was
just the name for the style of breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: where you'd just put it all, you know,
like the one male around all the females.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just let it go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get that that's cool, but I still
feel like the people in the know would be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to have some kind of guess of what it
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like I've heard, you know,
it's like a three way hybrid of land races
[SPEAKER_03]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, considering the fact that,
you know, um, the, the one that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, spread out, um, from Arcata,
um, in the late nineties is not the same
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of tend to think that it might've
been, uh, almost the Terpene profile that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you smell that Terpenaline,
you know, it's, it's the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Terpenaline that's in Durban poison,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I, um, I kind of wonder if it's
just not, Oh, you smell that and you
[SPEAKER_01]: think, Oh, that's train wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the earliest dated train wreck
literature that I've come across,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, is from 1982 in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that, that dates it back,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was nothing but land races and
train wreck, you know, all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and so just as a bit of a curiosity
question, as far as you're aware,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's the oldest clone in existence?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you a hint if you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few people have said, yeah, probably
Romulan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I don't even know how,
how old Romulan is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or even how, how available a legit
piece of Romulan is because Romulan is one
[SPEAKER_01]: of those ones that kind of got,
uh, screwed up a lot, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the whole BC scene where they started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started putting out a bunch of
hybrids as Romulan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everybody has a hybrid of Romulan
that they're calling Romulan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, does that one date all the
way back to Mendocino and the California
[SPEAKER_01]: blue Indicas?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard it goes back to 69.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you said does hold true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause what I heard was the case with,
so basically there was a guy and he was
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of doing his own thing for ages and
he had got it off Romulan Joe in 69.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when like, you know, the internet
came about, he came back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there's a whole lot of room in
that timeframe for things to have changed,
[SPEAKER_03]: as you said, but in saying that,
you know, I got a few good friends who
[SPEAKER_03]: they're pretty confident.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, who am I to say
otherwise?
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, yeah, as far as I'm aware,
the cut was lost, so to speak to the
[SPEAKER_03]: masses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was just this guy who popped
back up and, um, was kind of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, you know, I got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've just been a hermit for the last
30 years or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, like if it's true, shout out to
that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I actually was a kind of curious to,
um, check out that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that cut is if, if I'm not mistaken,
the original Romulan cut is kind of almost
[SPEAKER_01]: a lankier, um, plant with popcorn nuggets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, kind of like OG,
but a different looking plant for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I've heard a lot of people say
that the PNW hash plant is the source of a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of really good cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, potentially the, the same hash plant
that Neville originally used in the seed
[SPEAKER_03]: bank to create a lot of his lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think I've seen that you've got that
one or you had some experience with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your opinions on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm not going to say I have that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an old hash plant from up in the
Seattle area, Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but also there's a bunch of hash
plants up there, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Udubs and all those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's definitely one I can't,
you know, trace back to okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And say for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, you know, the one or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I, I know whatever, whatever
Neville, you know, collected and worked
[SPEAKER_01]: with was definitely a quality piece for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do you value like his stock as the
highest stuff you could possibly get?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if someone said to you, I've got a
pack of the seed bank, I've got a pack of
[SPEAKER_03]: SSSC and I've got a pack of bowl gear,
you know, brothers of the eternal love,
[SPEAKER_03]: which one would you pick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'd probably tend to go with bowl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what out of their stuff would you
be most interested in if you could get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just mean, you know, uh, I like the
original sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville seemed to be like a, a collector
who came over to the U S and bowl seemed
[SPEAKER_01]: to be like not so much collectors,
but essentially collectors who collected
[SPEAKER_01]: from other, you know, the sources of
origin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Neville is like a step removed from
where you kind of want to get the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: From an all Neville stuff was all,
you know, hybrids anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't do pure lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing which I was interested in is
I had heard that some of the bowl stock
[SPEAKER_03]: was hit and miss, which I thought was
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's like, if you thought about it,
you would, you'd swear that it's gotta be
[SPEAKER_03]: the most undiluted point, so to speak,
where you could get seeds from at least
[SPEAKER_03]: commercially in the Western world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you agree that it would have been hit
and miss or do you think, no, it should
[SPEAKER_03]: have been all fire?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it definitely hit and miss because
land pure land race, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds are extremely variable and the
amount of breeding that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has actually been done on a lot of them
is, is, is not, it's not very selective,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, at least from what I've seen,
you know, um, so yeah, I can definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine, you know, just based off my own,
you know, land race, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: preservation runs, you know, there's,
there's a lot of garbage and then you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, find good stuff, but it's,
it's not what most people want.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's also why I don't sell any of
that kind of stuff is because even though
[SPEAKER_01]: people think they want it, they really
don't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they, they grow to 10 pack and
they're like, Oh, fuck pirates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like all these, you know,
reads this crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and so would you ever consider maybe
taking a very select stable phenotype from
[SPEAKER_03]: a land race stock you found and maybe like
doing some S ones on it, seeing how stable
[SPEAKER_03]: it is and releasing that where it's like,
look, you want the land race Afghani,
[SPEAKER_03]: here's a somewhat refined, but still
undiluted version of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, even better, uh, um, when I take a,
uh, a land race and actually grow out a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred or 200 of them, or even something,
you know, as a simple as a preserve,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, you know, heirloom land
race, like pine tar Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my, my step one is always to,
um, do an open pollination where I take
[SPEAKER_01]: all the boys and I pollinate all the
girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I, I, when I do that,
I also make my selections for the next
[SPEAKER_01]: round and I pull out all the select boys
and all the select girls, the best of the
[SPEAKER_01]: best of those big lots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I directionally breed those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, it tightens it up a lot
and gets rid of all the garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for, you know, um, you know,
for a next generation, if I sprout those
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, it's going to be a, you know,
a lot more uniform, a lot more quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, I can go from there,
you know, um, with multiple generations to
[SPEAKER_01]: really isolate quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all breeding is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got a bit of a hairy question,
which might be hard to answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might be easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: People often talk about if you were to get
land race genetics yourself, you'd likely
[SPEAKER_03]: have to do some, you know, refining,
some culling, all of the usual business
[SPEAKER_03]: they mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question is in relation to a lot of
Southeast Asian land races, people will
[SPEAKER_03]: always say, expect some hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you do though, if basically
every female you had showed hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_03]: traits, have you just like, hit the losing
ticket there, or is it possible to breed
[SPEAKER_03]: those together and then in the F2s to try
to find something which didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: hermaphrodite, or is it just like,
you know, not worth wasting your time if
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't find semi-stableness in the
first generation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely say open pollinate,
uh, just like I do already, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: all your females times all your males,
and then grow out as large of a lot as you
[SPEAKER_01]: can and pull out, um, the least
hermaphroditic out of the bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, breed further with
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and oftentimes, um, if, you know,
you narrow it down like that, then you,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, can out-cross it to, you know,
uh, something else that's probably more
[SPEAKER_01]: stable and then get into the F2s of that
and actually pull something out that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, potentially won't have the
problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if people take a glance back at those
earliest seed bank magazines, often
[SPEAKER_03]: there'll be a little comment saying,
uh, inbred for four generations or
[SPEAKER_03]: something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that the type of timeframe you should
expect if you're going to try to embark in
[SPEAKER_03]: such a product, uh, a project,
or is that the timeframe to expect if you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to do it to the highest level?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of people will say that,
you know, like the early year was
[SPEAKER_03]: phenomenal and some will say, well,
that's because it was done properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is four generations like overkill to the
point where like you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: really, really good product or just the
standard?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, honestly, uh, a lot of the old ones,
um, uh, they, they pushed F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they, they searched you know,
line A and line B, they either used a
[SPEAKER_01]: clone for, you know, the mother and then
searched, you know, through a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants for, you know, the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, they released F1s a
lot of times, you know, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes, um, it all depends on how,
how well it's bred, you know, between,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, F1 and F4 or whether that F4 is
quality or garbage, you know, and unless
[SPEAKER_01]: you grow them out, that's the only way to
tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of, I guess, a point that
perplexed me for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, back in the day, theoretically,
there was the least amount of information
[SPEAKER_03]: about cannabis breeding around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, there's general breeding
philosophies, which are applicable to
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and never was utilizing those.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I struggled to understand is like
you just referenced, someone takes an F1,
[SPEAKER_03]: takes it to the F4.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually it's shit by the F4 because they
haven't done good selection along each
[SPEAKER_03]: step of the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like, it's hard for me to believe
that a certain amount of that didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: happen with Neville because it's almost
like what he was just like, or like
[SPEAKER_03]: extending it to most breeders back then,
you know, it's like what everyone took
[SPEAKER_03]: things several generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always an improvement at each step.
[SPEAKER_03]: They seemingly did it, you know,
like it didn't take them a year to do each
[SPEAKER_03]: generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They seemingly did it probably like,
you know, each three month cycle,
[SPEAKER_03]: they progressed a generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's like, were they like gods of
selection?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how, you know what I mean,
it just seems odd because I've got some
[SPEAKER_03]: Apollo 13 F4s and I got some F1s and it's
just like night and day difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I can't help it feel like a similar
thing must have happened to a smaller
[SPEAKER_03]: degree, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times breeders aren't
selecting from very big pools at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've read how, you know,
um, certain breeders, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: are only selected from 10 seeds at a run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, you know, that's,
that's not much, that's not much reading
[SPEAKER_01]: right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, um, I could do a lot of work if
I'm only doing it from 10, but I like to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with at least a hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it was a perfect world,
yeah, thousands would be real nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I read an article and it says that
you are really, this is going to sound
[SPEAKER_03]: funny, but it said you're a really good
interview because you're able to
[SPEAKER_03]: articulate your thoughts on males quite
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think honestly, that's probably the
question most people listening to this
[SPEAKER_03]: show are interested in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, how, how would you describe your
ideal male?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, is it dependent on each project?
[SPEAKER_03]: And more importantly, what characteristics
to you are good characteristics that you
[SPEAKER_03]: look for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I mean, um, I'm fairly simple with the
boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, ideally I'm looking for, um,
something that, you know, uh, puts on some
[SPEAKER_01]: frost, um, is stinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and usually that's kind of a benefit
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if, if they're frosty,
you can actually get, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of their terpene, terpene profiles
off of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've got buddies, uh, like with a 707
seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he, uh, and I think, uh, archive might
do it a little bit too, but 707,
[SPEAKER_01]: he, uh, um, he, uh, reverses all those
males with floral so he can really get a
[SPEAKER_01]: good, solid, you know, um, smell on,
you know, what they're like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of get a better look because it
reverses them and makes them kind of more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a female plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, uh, frosty males,
um, you know, stinky males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then bottom line is, uh, you know,
grow out the progeny and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I guess it goes without saying,
cause I mean, you just mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You think that resinous males are good or
maybe superior to others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you believe though that the,
uh, the terpene profile you get off
[SPEAKER_03]: rubbing those trichomes is pretty much
what it's going to pass on or there'll be
[SPEAKER_03]: some variation or it may not have any
correlation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it, it depends if the, um,
if those, uh, terpenes are recessive or
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant, you know, I've had some males
that are extremely dominant and then
[SPEAKER_01]: others that just, you know, go right
underneath, you know, and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and the females terps, you know,
pop right out on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's extremely variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do you feel about the idea
proposed by both?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of breeders actually,
but like notably DJ Short and Tom Hill
[SPEAKER_03]: threw their weight behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The idea that there may be something to
males that also produce a few pistols,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, in terms of them being like quite good
males, you know, like, I guess what you
[SPEAKER_03]: would say is males showing intersex traits
of being a female, you know, how do you
[SPEAKER_03]: feel about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, honestly, I, I definitely don't agree,
um, that, um, males that show intersex
[SPEAKER_01]: are, are better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think, um, Sam Skunkman said it
best, uh, you know, a herm is a herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter if it's a female herm or
a male herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen plenty of male herms,
you know, um, and a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think even, um, spot the,
the male herms out because most breeders,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, kill their males two to three
weeks into flower and don't even flower
[SPEAKER_01]: out the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a male is just like a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to herm a lot of times between
six and eight weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also a male is going to tend to frost
up, you know, six to eight weeks into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, just like that female,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so a lot of people, they kill
their males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kill their males before they ever frost
up, before they really get their terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, fully, you know,
developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so they never really know what
they're breeding with, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and so, you know, I, oh, sorry,
go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, I, I tend to, you know,
um, oftentimes let my, my, my male plants
[SPEAKER_01]: flower out like a full eight weeks or
more, you know, just to see what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what they produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just out of curiosity, have you ever seen
a male plant do a similar thing to a
[SPEAKER_03]: female where like at the end of the flower
cycle, it'll produce some intersex,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, you know, like nodes in order to maybe
try to self replicate?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think that's more of like a
deeply ingrained female trait as opposed
[SPEAKER_03]: to a male trait?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a lot of times the males don't,
don't, uh, put on pistols, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: until six weeks or further into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and if you were to get some of those
seeds created on the male pistols and you
[SPEAKER_03]: pop them, what would you expect the
offspring to be like?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've never sprouted them and
I've got at least three lots of seeds that
[SPEAKER_01]: are male times males in my fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some of them I've had there for quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and if we're going to, you know,
if we're going to believe, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, um, like Sam, the skunk man who's
actually sprouted these seeds and grown
[SPEAKER_01]: them, uh, supposedly they come up with,
uh, um, something like 25% female plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and then, uh, 50% kind of inter
intersex male plants and then 25% male
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I haven't personally sprouted
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so as like maybe a smaller breeder who
doesn't have like, uh, not, not you,
[SPEAKER_03]: but as someone else who doesn't have a lot
of facilities, maybe they're just toying
[SPEAKER_03]: around with their, like, you know,
a few tents or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any way you could recommend being
able to hold onto a male and being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: flower it out the full length without just
ruining your crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's, that's, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, um, when I do it, um, I either,
um, am doing my open pollinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just leave the males in the room
for the whole time and just take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: them to the end or other times I have,
uh, pulled out all the males, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, um, basically just filled a full,
you know, a four by four tent with
[SPEAKER_01]: something like 80 or so males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, you know, just kept them,
you know, going in little six inch square
[SPEAKER_01]: pots, you know, for eight weeks,
you know, it gives you that idea of what
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you know, what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah, as long as you have an
isolated space, um, it's not near the
[SPEAKER_01]: females, it's just fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, you just kind of mentioned an
interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've asked a few different guests,
what in your opinion is the ideal way to
[SPEAKER_03]: Fino hunt?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I mean by that is what's the
smallest size pot, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: that you think you can run a plant in and
you still get an accurate representation
[SPEAKER_03]: of the plant, but you know, like it's,
it's fairly small and you can fit a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of them in and do some good hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think the smallest I'd prefer to do
is probably about like a two gallon,
[SPEAKER_01]: a two gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which, you know, uh, the two galloners
I use, you can put 36 on a table,
[SPEAKER_01]: any smaller than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I don't know if you're getting,
um, uh, enough of a representation and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to lose quite a few because
of, you know, plants drowning out and just
[SPEAKER_01]: being too small to keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so something people will probably
notice if they check out your Instagram
[SPEAKER_03]: is, um, you're a fan of running like the
beds with the, like all the same strain in
[SPEAKER_03]: the bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you like a big advocate to this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think people really need to start
doing it themselves or do you think it
[SPEAKER_03]: just happens to suit you and you know,
it might not work for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, beds definitely, uh, um, have their
pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I generally have way more stuff than I
can handle and I don't have a big crew to
[SPEAKER_01]: help me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need, you know, stuff to be as easy
as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, for me, uh, you know,
running 10 or 20 beds is like running 10
[SPEAKER_01]: or 20 pots, you know, I mean, I only had
to water 10 or 20, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: versus hundreds and hundreds of pots,
you know, so it's, it's definitely a
[SPEAKER_01]: necessity for, you know, um, somebody
who's not running a big crew or anything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you find that, uh, the plants will
try to outcompete each other if they're
[SPEAKER_03]: not at the same strain?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's an idea that gets thrown
around a lot, but I've never actually
[SPEAKER_03]: toyed with it myself where, you know,
people say, Oh, if you run, if you run
[SPEAKER_03]: all, all seeds from the same strain,
like they'll just, they'll exist
[SPEAKER_03]: harmoniously, but if it's two different
strains, they'll fight each other and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, one will come out on top.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that's a bit of an
overstatement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if, if you have something fast
growing, um, in the beds, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and something slow grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, the fast grown ones are going to
blow away the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always try to kind of match what I'm
growing in my beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I either do a full bed of just,
you know, one, one type, or I,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, just make sure that they're
planted so that, you know, nothing's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get drowned out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure, even still, you know,
there's still seedlings and plants that do
[SPEAKER_01]: get drowned out from time to time,
but I'm always running, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 16, 25, 36, you know, or more per bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, I get most of them to
come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say looking at,
um, some of the, I believe it was the
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple Urkel TK hybrids, um, or something
along those lines, they were, they were
[SPEAKER_03]: all really uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so blown away, impressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, fuck, like that would,
that seems like it would have been a
[SPEAKER_03]: challenge to keep that going happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, luckily I've had a lot of
experience doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, some of these runs just,
you know, you throw them in, you trigger
[SPEAKER_01]: them two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just do it all themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and just a quick little
curiosity question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use CO2 at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's, it's fallen off a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think it used to be a lot more of a
bigger thing than it is now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like where do you sit on that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, um, I, I toyed around with it 20
years ago, um, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I, I've never, I've never really
used CO2 at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, when, when I was
commercially cropping the inside,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was still pulling, you know,
two, two and a half upwards of three
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even on some of my seed runs,
you know, where I'm growing straight from
[SPEAKER_01]: seed, I'm, I'm hitting two, two and a half
pounds of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, no CO2, uh, passive,
passive intake, just active exhaust and no
[SPEAKER_01]: air conditions, air conditioners or
nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm also on the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, in my neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just, um, to clarify for everyone,
are you an organic guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: You a new, uh, bottled guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you sit on it or how do you,
do you feel it affects the end product
[SPEAKER_03]: ultimately?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I'm, I'm organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'm extremely simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I really don't use barely any bottles
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mix dry amendments, uh, into my
beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, like fish meals,
bone meals, uh, or like fish bone meals,
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp, this, that, the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I just mix all that stuff in,
you know, at the beginning of each run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I water with plain water as
simple as it can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and basically I'm prepping to do,
you know, a really big indoor organic row
[SPEAKER_01]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's going to be automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm working kind of my,
my, uh, my, my setup towards, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just automated organic pure water,
you know, um, keep us and after my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so with that being said, do you find
that the end product is, is dramatically
[SPEAKER_03]: different?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm of the opinion that, um,
you know, I guess anything grown to the
[SPEAKER_03]: highest level is going to be really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as a general rule of thumb,
I find organic, even if it was,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's just say you had a strain and you
only consider it to have been grown to say
[SPEAKER_03]: 80% of its potential and we have two buds,
one organic, one synthetic or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like bottled nutrient type
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that if it's not maxing out,
I think if they were both a hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: percent well-grown, they'd be pretty
similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we're just talking, say 80% or less
than a hundred, which I think is the
[SPEAKER_03]: realistic situation most of the time,
it's not grown absolutely perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the organic one wins out by a fair
margin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think maybe it's a more of a
closer race than I'm giving it credit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, honestly, I think sometimes some of my
buddy's stuff that combine organics and
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals, um, you know, tend to,
tend to be a little more pungent and
[SPEAKER_01]: almost a little more tasty than just pure,
pure organics like I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, years ago I used to do a chemical
organic, you know, thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I, it definitely came out more
pungent when, when I was combining the
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was, um, I was definitely getting
high yields back then, um, using a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: bottled this's and that's and all that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I, I haven't honestly done a
side-by-side, uh, trial to really,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be the best bet,
you know, just side-by-side, same
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, same everything, but,
you know, keep one organic, do one,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, chemical and then, you know,
see what, you know, really, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: your taste buds tell you, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a bit of a, um, an organic snob,
you know, are you happy to try whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: or, you know, like would you get down on
some jungle boys stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even, um, even if I don't know where or
how it's grown, I think we, we all tend
[SPEAKER_01]: to, uh, take in and buy the stuff that
hasn't been, you know, done the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from time to time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll try a variety of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's change topic for a moment and get
to subject near and dear to my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And probably most people who listen to the
show, ChemDog, you are actually probably
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the, I guess to the public,
one of the lesser known aficionados,
[SPEAKER_03]: but for the people in the know,
I think a lot of people know that you are
[SPEAKER_03]: probably one of the foremost ChemDog
experts, especially in regards to,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, how they grow, being able to compare
them between each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Often I hear people tell me, you know,
parts of the Skunk VA story, which I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: very familiar with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll be like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Skunk VA posted online and inspector
was the guy who vouched for him and was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, yeah, that's the ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went and checked the thread and sure
enough, you are the first person to kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of chime in and be like, yep, that's
definitely the 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, you know, why don't you give
us a quick little rundown on your history
[SPEAKER_03]: with the ChemDog and how you kind of got
entwined in it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was an accident right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so basically, uh, um, it kind of stems
from a Jason King's canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that came out, um, early two thousands
and he was raving about this ChemDog,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, it was kind of on my list of,
you know, if I ever came across it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'd love to check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, come about 2004,
2005, um, you know, I got a, a ChemDog
[SPEAKER_01]: cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, from one of my buddies and
doing research on it, it didn't look
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing like a ChemDog, you know,
at least what I believe to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a legit ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, um, I was talking to my
buddy set at a 707 seed bank and he was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh, well, you know, I've got the
original ChemDog from Skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, well, sweet, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he, he basically gave me,
uh, you know, the ChemDog he had gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: directly off of Skunk VA and, um,
Skunk VA, you know, he was on Overgrow
[SPEAKER_01]: background 2005 and he had posted pictures
up and I think G was on there and G was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, yep, that's the ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody, you know, who was pertinent
to the discussion had, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much validated Skunk VA's ChemDog
as the one you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, that's the only one I want
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when G sent, uh, Joe Brand some
seeds and Joe Brand started the one
[SPEAKER_01]: through four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I, I told my buddy at the
time, you know, Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: run down to Sonoma and, you know,
get me some cuts off those seed plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he'd been talking to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he did that and he was all excited
about this, that, and the other ChemDog
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all I, all I wanted was that ChemDog
one through four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got those and then when G came
out to, uh, to do his 2006 tour,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, he, he gave, uh,
you know, multiple buddies, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the ChemDog D and the ChemDog sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got those, you know, from Obsolete
and then I also got another ChemDog D from
[SPEAKER_01]: Joe Brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but essentially, you know,
by 2006, I had, I think what seven
[SPEAKER_01]: different ChemDogs, you know, all from,
um, you know, the sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I grew them all out and
well, you know, And so how did you kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: go from having grown them to being more
kind of what I consider to be the man who
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people think is possibly the only
holder of like the one to the one and two,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I think you were the only one who
really put up like detailed descriptions
[SPEAKER_03]: and photographs of the one and two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone's always really interested,
like, do they still exist?
[SPEAKER_03]: And because there's kind of a bit of a
vacuum around that general discussion,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people just assume like,
Oh, inspectors probably got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's kind of funny because when I
ran those four out, um, Joe Brand,
[SPEAKER_01]: he, he sprouted the seeds and he grew them
out that summer in 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he really only gave the one through
four to two people, me and this,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, this other cat, um, down around the
Bay, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, who's actually, um, turns out as
buddies with, you know, some of my buddies
[SPEAKER_01]: down in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, um, so there was only two
people who ever had the one through four,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, aside from Joe Brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, um, anyways, uh, when I ran
all four of them out, um, I wasn't a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: fan of the number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of, um, kind of a more hazy
thing, more sativa thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just floofy buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, didn't really have the small profile
that I really cared for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I really liked the two though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had like cushy popcorn nugs on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, had a, like a bubble gum diesel smell
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it was really nice anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I gave, uh, I think at least three
or four of my buddies, um, the chem dog
[SPEAKER_01]: two cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I kind of right around that
time or a little after that time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of just dropped my entire mother
collection and took like a three year
[SPEAKER_01]: vacation, a little sabbatical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, when I came back, um,
my buddies are all, you know, they all had
[SPEAKER_01]: the chem dog two and I get it back and I
grow it out and I'm like, wait,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even chem dog two, you know,
I had scrapped the chem dog one or so I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought, well, as soon as I grew it out,
I knew I was like, oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every single buddy I had, I had given
it to same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, I had accidentally given
everybody chem dog number one and nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: had chem dog number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to this day, we still have chem dog
number one, but nobody's seen chem dog
[SPEAKER_01]: number two since about 2007, 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but the chem dog number one is
kind of unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's extremely high and mirror
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tests that I think upwards of like,
like 4% mirror scene, which is really
[SPEAKER_01]: strong for just a, you know, a mono
terpene, um, um, or whatever they call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, um, it's a 12, 12 plus weaker,
um, just as potent as any of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: chem dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, yeah, it hasn't, it hasn't
really gotten too widespread since,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, since Joe brand start sprouted that
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think pretty much anybody who has
it, um, got it from, from me or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, one of my buddies who I
originally gave it to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think the chem two is most
likely just gone in general or do you
[SPEAKER_03]: think maybe someone's got it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's definitely gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I made a couple hybrids with it
back in 06, 07.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, uh, Chrome, Chrome grew,
uh, the chem dog to crossed a deep chunk
[SPEAKER_01]: that I made, uh, I think in 07.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, um, yeah, I'd say,
I'd say it's safely gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, so I guess the big ultimate
money question is what do you think the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics behind all are like chem dog?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you think the chem dog comes
from?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think chem dog is just, uh, um,
I mean, uh, I've, my, my uncle,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, grown up, um, he was a professional
photographer and he kind of traveled the
[SPEAKER_01]: world a little bit, um, collecting seeds,
taking pictures, and then he brought a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of those home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've got, you know, he passed away
in the eighties, the mid late eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've got all these pictures that he
took of, you know, these pure land race
[SPEAKER_01]: Indicas and Sativas and everything that he
grew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, um, the chem 91 is very similar
to some of these pure land race Indicas,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that he had in the early eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, you know, I wouldn't be surprised
if it wasn't something pure like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe even just, you know, um,
some type of Mexican, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica or, you know, some type of Sativa
Indica hybrid, you know, from the early
[SPEAKER_01]: days back in Oregon, cause you know,
Joe brand is adamant that that came from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, those pounds came from,
uh, you know, Southern Oregon area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're one of the few people who I know
still has contact with Joe brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can you tell us about Joe B?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's he doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does he plan on popping his head up again?
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants to, he wants to, he's trying to
get his life back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so hopefully it works out and he
doesn't get caught up in things again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's definitely been through a
rough 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we just jump back to the feminizing
for a moment, you've asked time to fair a
[SPEAKER_03]: few lines, which one in your opinion has
the most treasure locked inside of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: which maybe isn't apparent on face value.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, if we reference the,
the barber you mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_03]: it has that lemon lime in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I guess that's not really
self-evident.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's locked in there by any means.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the greatest treasure trove strain
to S1?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, see, that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I really love a lot of the S1 Babas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're extremely unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, some of the Urkels they're,
they're rare, but there's some just pure
[SPEAKER_01]: grapey, you know, uh, I don't know,
just potty, just, um, really high quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, ones in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, um, my favorite, I think,
and this is just a personal thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, is, uh, the Mendocino purple S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's so much variation in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many different turpings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, it's extremely, uh, variable in,
in the S1s, um, with so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and just expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's definitely bar none my favorite,
even though it's not, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: even remotely one of the more potent,
uh, you know, ones out of the bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, I mean, we heard from Bob Hemphill
in a previous episode, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: not so dog was the guy who popped the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know if it's true that he initially
actually got two seeds and there was a
[SPEAKER_03]: male and he may or may not have culled it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I met not so dog, um, he actually
hit me up on Instagram and I had known
[SPEAKER_01]: some of his, you know, friends and
acquaintances and buddies over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And turns out we'd, we'd even been to the
same parties down in like Sonoma and
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but we'd never met.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyways, he hits me up on,
uh, Instagram and he's like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm the one who sprouted seed,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, um, from, from probably
almost 10 years ago, um, I had met some
[SPEAKER_01]: kids who actually knew him and they had
told me his story way back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know, um, didn't you
have a male and a female, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the male, um, accidentally got
killed when a light fell and loft off its
[SPEAKER_01]: top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, how did you know that
story?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, I got a weird memory
and, you know, I might've met,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some of your friends,
but yeah, he's like, I didn't tell almost
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, anyways, so he knew I was legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew he was legit cause his story was
like just added up, you know, all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we've, we've buddies ever since.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do you, do you think it's pretty
safe to say that male would have been
[SPEAKER_03]: something special also?
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have been, it could have been,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what do you think about the idea of
if you pop feminine seeds and you find a
[SPEAKER_03]: full on male, so it's not like a female
that shows male tendencies, but it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: a straight male and you can't find signs
of a female.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think the goal of that plan
is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is it safe to treat it?
[SPEAKER_03]: As if it's a male, like if you wanted to
breed with it, would you go ahead or?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm in a tough position with
that one because I have grown out
[SPEAKER_01]: literally thousands of feminine seeds that
I've made and I still have yet to find one
[SPEAKER_01]: single legitimate male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've followed other people who have
supposedly made the same exact S ones and
[SPEAKER_01]: S1 hybrids and they've pulled like
multiple males out of their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I honestly think, you know,
99.9% of males found in feminine seeds are
[SPEAKER_01]: from pollen contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically there's male pollen somewhere
and yeah, that's where the males come
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all my growing of S1s, I've found what
initially sexed or sexed as male and one
[SPEAKER_01]: of them, it was obviously a Pakistani
hybrid and I had done a Pakistani
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination in the room the round before
and I thought I cleaned the room proper,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm pretty sure, you know,
obviously I missed one grain of pollen,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another type, so that right there
is pollen contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other time I had a bomb threat
feminized hybrid sexing as a male and
[SPEAKER_01]: about two weeks into flower, it was all
balls and then it just started putting on
[SPEAKER_01]: hairs and it went full female after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is just an extreme hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of thousands of fems, that's my
experience with males and I think pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination, is the majority of the
males that people find, but who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it certainly seems like a
plausible explanation.
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're on that topic of like,
I guess, you know, kind of underlying
[SPEAKER_03]: issues with seed production, how do you
feel about the rise of the more larger
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders who I guess essentially have the
market and the resources to outsource
[SPEAKER_03]: their seed production?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that this is, we're entering
like a bit of shaky ground with that,
[SPEAKER_03]: or do you think that quality control is
not likely to suffer from doing so?
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think there's some definite
pitfalls with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some of the stories I've heard,
and I'm sure you've heard plenty of them
[SPEAKER_01]: too, a lot of these big companies,
they don't make their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times you see people growing
some of their seeds out and it is not even
[SPEAKER_01]: remotely as adverse advertised.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretending they're using,
or they're saying they're using this cut
[SPEAKER_01]: or that cut or the other, and it doesn't
resemble anything what they're saying as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as progeny goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, me personally, I don't believe in
outsourcing at all myself, but I know most
[SPEAKER_01]: of the big companies do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you ever consider kind of scaling up
your operation to have like, I guess,
[SPEAKER_03]: a bigger crew involved or do you always
want to keep it reasonably hands on
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as long as I have a good oversight
on everything, I could probably handle
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it with a crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as things progress, at least here in
California, I'm definitely gonna need to
[SPEAKER_01]: go that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have a small crew now,
but ideally, you need quite a large crew
[SPEAKER_01]: to go through the kind of numbers and
doing as much of the research and
[SPEAKER_01]: development as I'd like to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely gonna need a handful of
growers and just workers and all that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing to do a project like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've mentioned a few times in the
episode already, like the terpene content
[SPEAKER_03]: of plants, I'm noticing that terpene
content seems to be quickly overtaking in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of consumer preference, the idea of
THC percentages.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like first THC percentages came
around, people got hooked on that idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now terpene percentages are out,
more popular, people seem to be gaining
[SPEAKER_03]: traction readily, like the idea of let's
get real high terpene strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that this is gonna be a
lasting trend or just more of a fad thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I guess the underlying kind of
idea is that at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_03]: as much as the numbers of THC values maybe
boosted or detracted from the popularity
[SPEAKER_03]: of certain strains, people still kind of
agree that it's just about smoking it and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's kind of the best measure at the end
of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that will probably apply to
the terpenes as well, or you think it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: be a lasting thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll last at least for a good
while, especially considering a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: higher terpene strains people are using
for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even necessarily need that high
of a THC to make a high THC potent
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then all you need really is your high
terpene content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think especially the way everybody's
going with the flavors and all that,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll stick around for a good while I
think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you buy into the whole flavor game?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise I wouldn't have a hundred
different cuts sitting in my mother room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love oranges, grapes, apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love skunks and all the others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something you strive for in the
breeding?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were to kind of list the main
attributes you're looking to breed when
[SPEAKER_03]: you do a project like good structure,
good yield, all that type of stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: is a good flavor profile something you
highly value or not necessarily?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: My two criteria generally are effect and
not necessarily high THC, but just quality
[SPEAKER_01]: effect for my chemistry and then flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aside from that, I don't breed for a
sturdy, fast-grown, big plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: none of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want flavor and effect and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it falls in, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, I got what I want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, what plant is the best example
of that for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your favorite plant in terms of
flavor and effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorites in the last couple of years
have mostly come out of the Urkel hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the OGs times Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the chem dogs times Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple others offhand I'm not
thinking of right now, but those are
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely some of my favorites over the
last couple few years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Given you've done so many purple Urkel
hybrids and Bubba Kush hybrids,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do you think is your favorite crosses
you've done out of all of those ones,
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the Bubba's?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think Bubba paired with the
best out of all the ones you made?
[SPEAKER_03]: The same question for the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Urkel definitely, Triangle Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one just spit out so many unique and
tasty phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an easy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the Bubba, there was a handful of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the Bubba bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one had a lot of nice ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been about three years since I've run
all the Bubba's out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you plan on restocking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Either the Bubba or the purple Urkel
feminized lines in the near future?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I noticed when you did that,
I think it was earlier this year possibly
[SPEAKER_03]: even restock the lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like the second batch you'd made
of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like a third in the work so to
speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't restocked any.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a supply of what I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't plan on remaking any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the ones I even sell aren't
original.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not even anything new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people have sold the same exact
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm mostly making these for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put them on the market for other people
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't plan to remake any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: At most, I like to go through large
populations of the S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I might make an S1 feminized hybrid
that refines the hybrids and maybe cross
[SPEAKER_01]: those to some of the better ones that I
liked from each round.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as just remaking, yeah,
no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any special factors that go into
determining if a strain would be
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically good for reversing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it just the case that you just pick the
strain you want to reverse and that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: one you want to reverse and that's it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it like you look at a whole bunch of
strains and you think, oh, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a few characteristics in this
plant which would make it good as a donor
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, to start with CSI, I definitely went
with tried and trues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd reversed the Bubba in 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd pretty much reversed the Urkel in 2002
just with the accidental thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw what it could produce and really
liked the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was basically building off of stuff I
already knew and had already done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it was quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the future lines, it's definitely
some of the ones I reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely might not even release
because they might not produce what I
[SPEAKER_01]: hoped they would.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we just jump back to the labs for a
moment, where do labs sit for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use them at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: No?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not interested in the percentages?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel the percentages are just
overinflated at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: My buddy works for one of the more legit
labs and his lab tends to test a lot lower
[SPEAKER_01]: percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then some of these inflated labs that most
people want to get their stuff tested at,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is one of the reasons why I don't
generally use that as a proponent of my
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising campaign because something
that tests for me at 20% will test at
[SPEAKER_01]: another lab at 25% or 26%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely take all that data because
through my buddy, we test all the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't exactly release the data because
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about the whole increase
in popularity of getting everything file
[SPEAKER_03]: or sequence?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a proponent of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you against it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard there's two camps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to get some things file or
sequence, but file has approached me a few
[SPEAKER_01]: times over the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been adamant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll test anything I got for $300 a
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not paying for you to tell me what I
already know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, they don't even have a complete
system because they don't have the base
[SPEAKER_01]: clones to begin with on a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless they have a legitimate ChemDog 91
to start their galaxy with, unless they
[SPEAKER_01]: have a Triangle Kush to start their OG
Kush galaxy, if they don't have the core
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue that's responsible for all these
hybrids, then they don't have a galaxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a bunch of tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 91, the TK, the Mendo Purple,
the original Urkel, all of which can be at
[SPEAKER_01]: the core of certain galaxies, but if their
galaxies don't include those, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be accurate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard that there was certain people
who feel like you shouldn't get it done
[SPEAKER_03]: because if you get the sequencing done,
you lose the ability to patent or claim
[SPEAKER_03]: ownership over the plant because when it's
in the public domain, it's no longer yours
[SPEAKER_03]: to claim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you heard anything like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: If it were true, would that be something
that put you off it or do you think that
[SPEAKER_03]: the idea of trying to claim ownership of a
plant is a bit silly?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly how I feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's definitely cats doing that
and I think it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't stop progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about the somewhat
controversial subject or just the
[SPEAKER_03]: controversy this idea has been surrounded
in, in that seeking permission to breed
[SPEAKER_03]: with a strain from someone else before you
use it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does someone have to heat you up if they
want to use one of your males from one of
[SPEAKER_03]: your strains in a strain that they're
going to then go and sell?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you sit on that whole issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely is a matter of respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't view it as necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't look at my seeds as possessions,
especially if they're sold, but even if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're given, I'm very adamant on if I
give somebody something and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: restrictions or anything on it,
I'll tell them straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, people are free to work with
gifts and especially bought seed to their
[SPEAKER_01]: heart's content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's definitely respectful to
ask breeders and the sources approval if
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to work with their stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to play devil's advocate,
what would you do if you wanted to use a
[SPEAKER_03]: male?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you do if Tom Hill hit you up
and said, Hey, I just changed my mind on
[SPEAKER_03]: the PTK and I actually don't want you to
use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think at that point that respect
should go so far as to canning the
[SPEAKER_03]: project?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be a tough one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be a tough one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely respect Tom and his
wishes for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that's how we should all be.
[SPEAKER_01]: As for the PTK, my number one goal is just
for preservation of the pure seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else that stems of it is just a
bonus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I think Tom, just as an example,
is one of those people who understands he
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't hold any of those lines as his
possessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he views them as he was just a
keeper of those genetics for his time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I view things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all just keepers for as long as we
are a keeper and then it needs to go on to
[SPEAKER_01]: the next person.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of people who are
opportunists and they get 10 seeds from
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody and it's off to the races to make
that next hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just reproduce it and sell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw the funniest man the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I was like a guy trying to
start a seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I need a kind of Girl Scout
cookies and a 10 pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are some of the breeders who you
really enjoy the work of or you really
[SPEAKER_03]: think highly of their work and even maybe
go so far as to be like, their stuff is
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel they follow similar ethics to I do
and I would even be happy to possibly do a
[SPEAKER_03]: project with them because we could meet
eye to eye on that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not shy about my favorite readers and
I like to consider my favorite readers
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely a huge fan of Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of the best in my book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mean Gene, he's rock solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a spot where he could make an
extra buck, he's going to tell you the
[SPEAKER_01]: truth and lose that buck over that dollar,
which I definitely can respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys like that who just have that
integrity and just honesty, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: just looking out for that dollar in
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are definitely my favorite readers
and the ones I look up to.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were just a grower or maybe a
better way to put it is if you lost your
[SPEAKER_03]: whole collection as it were, seeds,
clones, everything and all you had to your
[SPEAKER_03]: name was like 150 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, you can buy like one packet of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which pack would you buy to restart the
empire?
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You drive a hard bargain.
[SPEAKER_01]: One pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this include I don't have any friends
anymore?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no one's going to help you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should out of luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: So well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go with like I'll go with like some
gelato times wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: That money quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I can afford more.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's probably the best answer ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of relating, what would your
advice be to a newly emerging breeder?
[SPEAKER_03]: More specifically, when should someone
feel comfortable to not only release,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that they can feel comfortable
charging for the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not talking about you just make some
seeds and give them to your friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when should you feel confident that
you have done the adequate work to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to approach a seed bank and be like,
look, maybe you could consider stocking my
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff and I feel like it's of high enough
quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should they wait a certain time?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your advice in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just from what I've seen,
at least in the present time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to stop anybody from
breeding or creating a seed company or
[SPEAKER_01]: going with it with even limited experience
just because it seems these days that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: more about branding than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the future, hopefully the bar gets
raised to where you actually need to
[SPEAKER_01]: really be a professional grower one and
really have a strong understanding of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant and how it breeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what to even look for when you're
doing selections in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do you think breeders who come to
the market with one parent from Top Dog
[SPEAKER_03]: and one parent from Pirates of the Emerald
Triangle and have made a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: F1s guys, do you think there's a place for
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think people should be looking
to maybe do more work than that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And more importantly, I guess my other
question is, do you think that it's a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: of a cop out for someone to maybe develop
a male?
[SPEAKER_03]: And by that I mean, it's not just an F1,
maybe they've even taken it to the F2 or
[SPEAKER_03]: made an F1 and then crossed it to another
one of their strands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've got some ownership over it,
but then they've just crossed that to 10
[SPEAKER_03]: clone onlys and that's their whole
offering.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: In today's world, I think it's par for the
course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not ideal, but there's cool stuff to
be found in lots of the hybrids and some
[SPEAKER_01]: that you wouldn't even think would turn
out really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely have a different perspective
than I used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have more of a purist idealist
perspective and now it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, there's 101 ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to the consumer to choose who they
want to support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last little question for this segment.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could only hang on to one clone
you've currently got, which one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want, you do three.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're giving me three, I'd probably
hold on to Triangle Kush, Chem Dog 91,
[SPEAKER_01]: and three's still limiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Urkel and Mendo Purple both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably have to stick with the Mendo
Purple.
[SPEAKER_03]: It outages the Urkel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Urkel breeds better, but there's a lot
of potential in that Mendo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's something maybe a lot of
people wouldn't necessarily think off the
[SPEAKER_03]: bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also personal preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody's going to share it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just out of curiosity, do you find one is
more indica leaning than the other or
[SPEAKER_03]: they're both about the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Urkel is definitely more indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mendo Purple is more of a daytime type
of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's terpenes are just, you know,
oo-wee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next bunch of questions were ones
submitted by our fans.
[SPEAKER_03]: First one.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your preferred method for selfing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they mean, you know, like thiol
sulfate, colloidal silver.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your route?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always do silver thiol sulfate just
because it's easiest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only have to spray them two or three
times at most versus colloidal where you
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much have to spray them every day
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what time period do you spray the
plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I know that's something which kind
of varies a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like do you spray them before the other
females get in there during?
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually a lot of times you have to spray
your target female about two weeks before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to flower her two weeks in
advance of the rest of the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: spray her at trigger, you know,
and then when the other plants get in,
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally spray her again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lately I've been doing a thing where I
tend to spray every 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to make sure, you know,
she stays a he.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you spray when you trigger,
you're not going to be getting pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: until about five to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flower generally, but if you spray
two weeks in advance, you're getting that
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen between three and four weeks,
which is, you know, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so have you ever, did you keep the
donor plant completely segregated or have
[SPEAKER_03]: you found that it can be in the same room
and you give it a spray and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have impact on the other plants in the
room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just make sure not to get any of the
spray on the other girls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do feminized seeds have a place in
breeding as mothers in order to create reg
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I don't want to give out
all my trade secrets, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, half the reason I, you know,
reverse my lines is so I can isolate my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite parts of each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking to, you know, pull out my
favorite you know, examples of a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: through the S1s and actually breed further
into the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not only with, you know,
S2s and everything, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with regular seed out crossings with S1s
and S2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we've already kind of touched
on this, but just to nail the point home,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is your favorite cam?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for, um, for raw power and smoking,
I think the D is really good, but for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a purist and from a idealist
perspective, the 91 is the only one I
[SPEAKER_01]: really, you know, want a longterm breed
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think it's the original mother
source of all the cams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as a follow up from myself,
do you believe that with the right
[SPEAKER_03]: partner, the cam 91 could produce some
seeds, which rival its potency?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think that in itself is kind of
like the one in a million in terms of its
[SPEAKER_03]: potency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's quite unlikely you'll get stuff
as potent from it in seed form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, if you think that the KMD,
um, is, if you think along the lines of,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a, most likely a feminized hybrid of
the 91 itself, it's a lot stronger than
[SPEAKER_01]: the 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a lot of the cam 91 hybrids I've
personally bred, um, they test higher,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, then the, the original cam 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, uh, you know, there,
there's a lot stronger potency held within
[SPEAKER_01]: its genes and generally is expressed
through the cut itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we touched on the Humboldt snow a
bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you happen to know the origins of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I suppose so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, the, the guys I've been talking
to seem to seem to, um, seem to think
[SPEAKER_01]: that, um, it originally came from the
Eugene area, um, up in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, they're saying that, um,
well, it's, it's essentially the same as
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon snow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but they, they, they're, they're
saying that it's, uh, most likely a,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not essentially a bag seed,
but, uh, um, possibly like a feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrid or selfing of, uh, the Fairfax four
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm looking to, you know, kind of look
into that a bit further myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it seems like it has a lot of
potential and I've had, I've heard
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple, um, you know, stories from
multiple sources, uh, that seemed to point
[SPEAKER_01]: in, you know, some, some version of that
direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to also, you know,
add to that the Fairfax four way,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, uh, basically a Pakistani,
Afghani, um, Indian crossed to skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's three land races and then skunk
number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, certainly have you grown it out?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not yet, but I'm looking forward to,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a, have you got, you got,
you know, someone who's got it cause it's
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's definitely around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know people with it.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause what's interesting about that one
is, um, Bob Hemphill had said that in his
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion, he felt the four way had degraded
over the years more so than the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, however, the four, the four way
was popped in 95, I think he said.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what he was trying to get at was
like, it had degraded more so in less
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, have you got any experience with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any cuts which maybe aren't as
old as the chem 91, but in your opinion,
[SPEAKER_03]: they've degraded more significantly than
it has in, you know, a shorter timeframe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, most of the, the old cuts I
have, um, are fairly solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, except, uh, I don't know, that's a
whole different discussion with the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: dud thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if people are referring to
kind of the dud thing, or if they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about, you know, lesser
degradation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they've been like, just as time
goes by, the end product is just not as
[SPEAKER_03]: good as it once used to be, even though
it's been growing quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, the, the snow I've held for
almost 20 years still produces the same
[SPEAKER_01]: exact, uh, you know, quality that I
remember 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe like the caveat that's
placed on that conversation is that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: totally dependent on like how the plants
are stored.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're like a cash cropper and you
don't really put much time or effort into
[SPEAKER_03]: your mother room, it's just literally
serving a purpose of like taking clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like over years, like those kinds of
neglected conditions is what leads to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas you may just not see that
whatsoever because you don't put them in
[SPEAKER_03]: those conditions whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, mine get treated a little rough.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe there's hope for all, for all of us
out there who need to improve our mother
[SPEAKER_03]: stations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So next question, what information can you
give us on the Big Bad Bubba?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one's the Big Bad Bubba?
[SPEAKER_03]: Quickly check.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's, is it one of your crosses?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like Firo G, Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Firo G, Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's a cross to Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just a, um, just a high quality,
uh, um, you know, hybrid of the three that
[SPEAKER_01]: I give away for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went under another name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went under another name, the Firo G,
Chem D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, I just give it away for free
cause I had the seeds and it's quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't exactly want to give credit to
the fellow it came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So next question, when did you,
when did you get your Bubba cut and who
[SPEAKER_03]: was it from and what do you think Bubba is
exactly genetically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got my Bubba in 2005 from my buddy,
uh, 707 Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he goes by the names, uh, Sierra Skunk
and Shaw Bud, you know, on the various
[SPEAKER_01]: forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and he's been on the forums,
I think longer than I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I got that from him in 2005 and
he's had it since at least 2000,
[SPEAKER_01]: if not a little, a little earlier than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, Archive got the same Bubba from
him as well and a handful of other cats
[SPEAKER_01]: and his was sourced, you know,
down around the LA area, um, from a
[SPEAKER_01]: glassblower buddy, um, uh, you know,
17 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, um, I, I believe it's,
uh, you know, just straight from,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, Josh and Matt's,
uh, you know, extended circle down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you believe that whole story that
the parents was a strain called Bubba and
[SPEAKER_03]: they crossed it to the OG or do you think
that's maybe not entirely accurate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably as accurate as
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at first I didn't believe the
story and people I knew who had met that,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, uh, Matt, you know, are like,
ah, he's full of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, you know, um, you know,
as time went by and I saw a few will,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, uh, other things that led me
to believe different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I definitely believe, you know,
it's, it's a simple story and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a lot of real BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's almost too honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it hermed in my closet under the
stairs, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then sorry, a little follow up one to
that was out of your Bubba hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you found any, which on the whole,
stay quite true to the Bubba, but get rid
[SPEAKER_03]: of the horrendously long veg time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay true to the Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say so because a Bubba,
uh, the Bubba hybrids tend to segregate in
[SPEAKER_01]: two different directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're either, um, about 50% of them are
like Bubba, which you're not losing the
[SPEAKER_01]: veg time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the other 50% tend to,
you know, grow, um, a lot more vigorous
[SPEAKER_01]: like the mother plant, um, that they came
from and they tend to have the mother's
[SPEAKER_01]: chart paint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, um, faster grown Bubba not
quite yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So have you ever done a back cross using
feminized pollen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, you know, like you make like a
feminized cross and then you hit one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the offsprings of that with the same
pollen you used to make the feminized
[SPEAKER_03]: cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I think I have, uh, well,
let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I, I did Obama Kush, um,
basically, uh, uh, Mendocino purple cross
[SPEAKER_01]: to, uh, um, Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I, uh, well, I didn't name it
Obama Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my buddy, uh, up in Tigard,
uh, he named it Obama Kush throwing him
[SPEAKER_01]: under the bus right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, so I took that clone and then
I pollinated it with Bubba Kush again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a back cross of sorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, even Katsu Bubba could
kind of be considered the same when I
[SPEAKER_01]: cross Katsu to the original Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's kind of a back cross or
something of sorts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what is the go with, um,
I've heard of like Obama Kush being like,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a totally different genetic makeup to
what you listed as, is there someone else
[SPEAKER_03]: who tries to like take credit for it or
something?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was like a dispensary and they
said it was like super skunk and something
[SPEAKER_03]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well to clarify, there's definitely at
least three or four different Obama Kushes
[SPEAKER_01]: because everybody named their favorite
Kush after Obama, you know, when he first
[SPEAKER_01]: came up, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, there's a Obama Kush down in
San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's an, um, an Obama Kush over in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there, and then my Obama Kush,
which is extremely popular around,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Portland and Eugene and Seattle,
the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, that, that came from me and
my buddy, you know, Tigard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, Leafly or Leafly or whatever they,
they call themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they have it as a Afghani OG or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, um, they're, they're based
out of Oregon, so they should kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you know, what the popular Obama
from that area is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're notorious for, um, having
incorrect information about strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: My favorite one is the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go look it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It says Chem 91 is a cross of Chem dog and
skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It literally says that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then me and my buddies have talked to
him a little bit and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we'll change them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to hit us up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's funny?
[SPEAKER_03]: I hit, I sent him an email one day and I
said, why don't you guys just pay someone
[SPEAKER_03]: to like, just do this properly and like
fix all the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they sent me an email back being like,
Oh, we just rely on information submitted
[SPEAKER_03]: by our users.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so I was like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why we're in the state we're in
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, next question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you dealing with making the
transition to the legal market?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it's, it's going to be
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, no, no, no telling right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worst case scenario, I'll have a good high
paying job for some corporate big money
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, best case scenario, I'll have my own
company and, uh, you know, find a little
[SPEAKER_01]: niche that I can fit into that'll support
all the research and development that I
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of want to do in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so this one's, I'm not entirely sure
what they're getting at.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just choose to answer it how you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the best way to pollinate something
without having it seed your whole room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the part which doesn't quite
make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it out of the room and spray water on
it after.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, I don't think they're talking about
a male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they're saying, if I want to
pollinate a female and I do pollinate it,
[SPEAKER_03]: should I then like take it out of the room
and like spray it down after it's accepted
[SPEAKER_03]: the pollen or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I understand what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if, if, if you have mobile plants
where, you know, you have your plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: your female plants, um, in a, in a pot
that you can actually bring out of your
[SPEAKER_01]: room and put and say like a dark tent or
something, uh, you can, you can definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: just pull that plant out, pollinate it in
that little private tent, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all by itself, leave it there for 24 hours
in the dark is just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then spray it down with water,
just like they're saying, and pop it back
[SPEAKER_01]: up in your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you won't have stray pollen cause
water kills all the pollen and it will
[SPEAKER_01]: produce all the seed it needs to that
pollinate in your room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you able to give us a little more
information on your 10 slash 14 light
[SPEAKER_03]: cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's usually only a light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would use for a longer flower and
sativas or in the heat of summer,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to reduce temperatures or if
you want to pull off a crop a little
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, um, than normal, I generally
don't use them, uh, unless it's a heat
[SPEAKER_01]: issue or, you know, I want to ripen stuff
up early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it definitely affects yields a bit
just cause you're, you're losing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a good portion of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, yeah, it's a time and a place
type of thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what's your favorite place to eat in
the triangle?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish we had good food around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, honestly, uh, I like some of the
little Mexican joints as long as they have
[SPEAKER_01]: good margaritas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what's the difference between
granddaddy purple and the Southern humble
[SPEAKER_03]: purple?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, I'm not exactly sure what goes
around the Southern humble purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, granddaddy purple,
of course, is Urkel times, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: salmon Creek, big bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, whereas, uh, um, Southern humble
purple generally refers to just purple
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel, um, or a purple Urkel type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's kind of just a vague,
maybe generalization a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's the difference between Grapeape
and purple Urkel?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think purple Urkel is the dad or
how do you think it offshoots from it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I ran out, you know, beds full of,
uh, Urkel, um, granddaddy purple,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Grapeape, you know, Pakistani purple,
uh, black, uh, Bridgefield black Afghan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a ton of these different purples from
around the triangle years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, the Grapeape, uh, supposedly has
the same heritage, same exact heritage as
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it seems to grow a little bit
stronger and a little bit faster than,
[SPEAKER_01]: than the Urkel I've had since,
you know, 2001, 2002.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what is your soil recipe for indoors?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you, you touched on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's the, you know,
without listing weights and stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what are the basic amendments
you're chucking in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, basically, um, I keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, you know, for my own needs,
I use a black gold cocoa blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, um, I mix in, uh,
like some Bokashi, um, let's see,
[SPEAKER_01]: what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some insect frass and then fish meals,
fish bone meals, uh, alfalfas,
[SPEAKER_01]: kelps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it depends on which run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I just go, you know,
with a little bit of a high nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other times I'm throwing in a bunch of
extra rock dust, green sands, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term release stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I always, uh, add a nice chunk of
a diatomaceous earth and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Omri, uh, natural, um, because anytime
you're doing organics and cocoa and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that, yeah, you got to keep those gnats at
bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why make an S1 given there's such a
stigma around feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially compared to other NorCal
growers?
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at Mean Gene and Loompa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think maybe what they're saying is like,
you sell more because if you did dregs,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I don't understand the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, honestly, in the future,
um, a lot of people are probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: lean towards, um, well done, consistent,
uh, feminized seeds over regular seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of people aren't going to
have the time or the space to even grow
[SPEAKER_01]: males or even need males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you take the recreational market in
Oregon and California where everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to grow four to six plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody, any of those people
are going to want to grow males,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're only allowed such a
limited number of plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, feminized seeds are essentially,
you know, um, a perfect option and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of the stem stigma behind feminized seeds
is, is kind of false, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anytime somebody starts going on
and on about how bad feminized seeds are,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I asked them, well, hey, you're
regular seed breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they using chem dogs, diesels,
OG cushions, Girl Scout cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those things came from feminized
seeds crossed to a male plant of some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like, you know, people need,
uh, eventually they'll get educated and
[SPEAKER_01]: realize, oh wait, how come, you know,
the most notorious breeders in the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: world, like Sam Sconkman and Chimera are,
you know, huge proponents for feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the brightest out there, you know,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was about to say, sorry, sorry to that
viewer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I butchered the question, but we got
through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, from our buddy, Peabod Mike,
who'd you have in the fight last night?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm a simple man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I only like a few things and most of
it's just weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't even do sports.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's just me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't hoping one was going to edge
in front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we, are we talking boxing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what were some of the traits about the
Pakistani chitral that really drew you to
[SPEAKER_03]: it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what, what were the ones you looked
for in the mail you selected?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so with the chitrals, um, one of the
things I really liked about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, or them in general was the fact that
they're extremely strong and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, pining and limonene and turpentine and
they don't have a lot of the common,
[SPEAKER_01]: just Amsterdam terpenes, just Mircein and
karyophylline, you know, there's so much
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff out there that it's just loaded with
Mircein and karyophylline that these,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just pungent, you know,
over the top sharp astringent,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, terpenes are, are kind of
refreshing, you know, and I use more than
[SPEAKER_01]: one male, um, you know, in, in,
in the breeding, um, with the Pakistanis,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, but, uh, they, they definitely were,
uh, strong plants, um, stable plants and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, we're, we're, we're as close to,
you know, what I was, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for out of the line as I could
possibly get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And will you use that male for other
projects or do you think you kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: retire him after this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I might use, uh, I might use them a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I, I've still got a couple,
a few of those males, um, set aside and I
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely know what he breeds for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there's definitely a potential for
future breeding with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think the genetic makeup of
the black is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, so, um, are we talking about the
black I use probably yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, honestly, I have no solid
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this plant basically grows like a
bigger Bubba Kush plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it has a fairly unique, uh,
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at first I thought it was nothing
special, um, as far as, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just figured it was like a Bubba hybrid
of sorts, but, um, I guess it dates back
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a ways, um, in the High Palm area
of, uh, Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't even know this until I kind
of refreshed recently, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, it was even featured in, uh,
I think Jason King's either first or
[SPEAKER_01]: second Canna Bible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but as far as, you know, exact
lineage, I mean, my cousin sourced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poof, at least 10, 12 years ago out of
High Palm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, from there, I don't know,
aside from it just being, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar to Bubba Kush, but with,
you know, different terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how did the packy male in general
influence the chem dog in the crosses you
[SPEAKER_03]: made?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how did the crosses come out
basically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, those are actually some of my,
uh, favorite ones out of the, out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: F1 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they basically, uh, made the chem dogs
terpenes, uh, kind of exaggerated,
[SPEAKER_01]: made them more pungent, uh, more sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so like with the Chem D, um,
I mean, I ended up with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just ones that were extremely pungent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and one of them in particular,
uh, it just, uh, it smelled like just
[SPEAKER_01]: super sharp, uh, motor oil, like grease
almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it tasted exactly like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which you'd think was a bad thing,
but it, it was strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of a good thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sandalwood coffee and pine.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are terpenes, which don't seem to
really pop up as much anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any kind of theories as to why
that might be?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think they just fell out of favor
or maybe they were like not really
[SPEAKER_03]: dominant terpenes or?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, me and a couple of buddies,
we love pine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, there's a lot of pine stuff
we're working with and towards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's one of the reasons why,
you know, I like the, uh, the Pakistani is
[SPEAKER_01]: because, uh, there's a lot of pine in
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, pining a pining B,
you know, and, uh, then Urkel Urkel has a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of pine in it, which, you know,
that might even, you know, entertain the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole pine Tarkush, you know, parentage
theory right there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also another reason why, you know,
growing out the Christmas buds because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, looking for a pine terpenes,
but yeah, over here, we love pine,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, sandalwood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm not so sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what was the other terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's, there's definitely plenty
of coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy just needs to get his hands on
some Baba Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no shortage of coffee.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so this one I might cut out because it
might, if the answer is what I think it
[SPEAKER_03]: is, it might reveal too much, but
basically someone's messages and,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, they've said, do you know if Sierra
skunk is the guy that skunk VA mentions is
[SPEAKER_03]: like his friend who lived in Tahoe and
basically in skunk VA story, he's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, I had this friend in Tahoe and I
gave him the chem dog and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: go there and we'd snowboard and blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, maybe that's not enough info for you
to really answer that one, but this guy
[SPEAKER_03]: seems to think it's the same person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, so he's wondering if you know anything
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sierra skunk isn't, isn't the guy from
Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like to use any specific types of
growing in regards to like training?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, are you like a lollipop dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you like a main line, a few colors,
you just let them do their own thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your kind of take on it all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so as, as natural as I can,
but I also like to clean up the unders
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, clean up the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of close to lollipop,
but somewhere between lollipop and a
[SPEAKER_01]: natural plant structure, you know,
is how I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what method do you find is the best
for trying to yield the most generally
[SPEAKER_03]: speaking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, being that I'm not really
going for yields ever, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I, I, I'm, I'm one of the people who,
uh, firmly, uh, goes with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's 101 right ways to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you can get high yields with a
dozen different methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever works best for you is what I
always tell them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll just jump into our last few
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of little short answer ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your least favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, least favorite, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are usually the ones that you just
toss, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tossed quite a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I have, uh, any least
favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, uh, I ran out of land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a Pakistani Yarkon recently,
and it was absolutely terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was, I was going to,
I was going to do a reproduction of it and
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what am I reproducing here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a recent memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think is the most overhyped
strain?
[SPEAKER_03]: So not necessarily like, you know,
like blue dream, it's real hyped,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like what strain do you think gets a
good rap on the whole, but it's actually
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, oh, there's tons of them these days,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I mean, me personally, you kind of
nailed it with the damn blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, it's been so popular,
um, up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, even some of my kid brothers
have run like 99 plant gardens of nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: but blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the past five to 10 years
and I've never even grown the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like, no, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I'm going to give it to blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so in terms of both, like,
you know, the breeding side of things,
[SPEAKER_03]: but as well as also like the general
political domain, what do you think's the
[SPEAKER_03]: worst thing to have happened to the
cannabis scene since you've became
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, probably recreation, recreational
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, I don't, I don't know any,
any, uh, growers, at least in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, who really voted for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I mean, just watching what's
happened in Colorado and Washington and
[SPEAKER_01]: even Oregon, you know, coming on now,
I mean, uh, it's, it's pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: killing, uh, it's killing, uh,
the way things used to be in a anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what, a lot of people, what are kind of
like the pitfalls that are, that were
[SPEAKER_03]: oversighted, you know, like what's
happening now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the case that people are losing like
their right to grow or like the numbers or
[SPEAKER_03]: what's up with the legalization?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just mass production, uh,
big money commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, one, one, you know,
huge grow can wipe out, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a hundred or a thousand, you know,
small farmers, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's just been a way of life,
you know, in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, Oregon and, uh, just around
where I grew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's not going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be that way for much longer
at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you think is the biggest
mistake you see like kind of newly
[SPEAKER_03]: emerging breeders make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Biggest mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, probably crossing a one male times one
female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, small selections, small selections
and, um, the one-to-one model,
[SPEAKER_01]: the one-to-one model is never good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and then final one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: No final one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Second last one.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is kind of your growing tip for
everyone listening?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's a little secret you think
maybe not a lot of people do when growing
[SPEAKER_03]: and it helps out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could even be like, you know,
the use of a particular supplement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember one time someone said,
make sure you use silica, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that shit's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let me think, uh, the simplest thing,
thing I, oh, I'm, yeah, right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I see it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: People try to complicate their grows,
you know, they, they use a dozen
[SPEAKER_01]: different, you know, bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they try to, they, they kill their
plants with kindness, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they don't even manage to,
you know, um, reap the rewards of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything they're given.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say, don't forget about keeping it
simple because you can produce excellent
[SPEAKER_01]: quality, excellent yields and say,
save yourself a bunch of headache and
[SPEAKER_01]: money by just keeping it simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Onto the real last question now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I like this one because it gives a
good insight into all the breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could go to one place in time and
history, um, geographically or that,
[SPEAKER_03]: where would you go to collect land-raised
seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, it'd probably have to be,
uh, can I have a, um, uh, a resource?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there were certain years that were
really good for hash production,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, back in the sixties and
seventies, I had just needed to pick the
[SPEAKER_01]: right year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely go to, you know, somewhere
along the Hindu Kush mountains,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Afghanistan, Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm definitely more of a, an Indica
type myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, somewhere, somewhere in the
sixties and seventies, uh, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: right about around then there,
that'd be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be about right for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any comments, shout outs, anything like
that you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, oh, I usually have brain farts during
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I'm good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we covered it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we have, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much again for coming and,
you know, dropping all these knowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: bombs on us and helping us fill in all the
blanks.
