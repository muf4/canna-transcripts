[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna be jumping straight into it
with your boy Erasing lock in for another
[SPEAKER_02]: two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into it So yeah, what a
fantastic explanation of all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: areas if we kind of just keep on that same
topic I noticed in one of your posts
[SPEAKER_02]: you're in one of the valleys looking at
one of the different farms in the Kaiba
[SPEAKER_02]: pass around the Pakistani area and you
mentioned how Some of the farmers like to
[SPEAKER_02]: import the high-altitude varieties and
they'd hybridize it with their stock and
[SPEAKER_02]: it would give a kind of quicker flowering
more squat more resinous plant This was
[SPEAKER_02]: like you mentioned this as though it was
done very intentionally and methodically
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like this type of breeding has
always occurred because I think people
[SPEAKER_02]: often talk about land race breeding as
though there wasn't a ton of Kind of shall
[SPEAKER_02]: we say intelligent breeding done,
but this very much points to the opposite
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, I mean the way you I'm
attentive and like put it across so I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: there are a few different things happening
of course here like everywhere else So
[SPEAKER_03]: first of all, we have to understand,
you know the cultural basis of that
[SPEAKER_03]: practice now This is not something that
has been happening for the longest period
[SPEAKER_03]: of time Like this is not definitely not
been happening for thousands of years in
[SPEAKER_03]: Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay now some of the regions of Pakistan,
I mean even before we get to that I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: let me just build a little more,
you know cultural context here because see
[SPEAKER_03]: Pakistan is predominantly it's a Muslim
country that people over there case 95% of
[SPEAKER_03]: the people are Muslim by religion and the
country that is next to them is
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghanistan and that is also
Predominantly, you know Muslim family.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry Muslim country.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm so sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a Muslim country, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you you tend to have a great deal
of interaction between these two countries
[SPEAKER_03]: because of this common theme Which is the
Islamic religion, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So Now what is happening is there are
certain areas of Pakistan where this
[SPEAKER_03]: happens and those areas are Situated
around the raw valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is like 32 31 and 33 degrees degree
north.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay now those Regions while they are
significantly higher are still not,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know high enough on latitude that they
would induce a quintessential Expression
[SPEAKER_03]: that people, you know usually refer to as
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay So what happened was that some of the
people from Pakistan must have been
[SPEAKER_03]: traveling to you know Afghanistan and they
must be seeing these varieties over there
[SPEAKER_03]: that Tend to have you know better resin
content better effects and just there's
[SPEAKER_03]: this better overall I mean in in terms of
production I mean as one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_03]: why you know, everybody wants to breed
with them So it was a very natural
[SPEAKER_03]: progression for them to only get those
seeds in Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here is this Interesting part now,
they're not intelligently thinking at this
[SPEAKER_03]: point in history Okay, we're gonna get
these seeds to our country and then we're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna mix them with our you know
indigenous Varieties or you know the
[SPEAKER_03]: regional varieties that we have they're
not thinking in those terms That is
[SPEAKER_03]: something that is gonna happen as a result
of they getting those seeds Into the
[SPEAKER_03]: country because they think that you know,
of course these these are so much better I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean the highest if not better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's so much different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean such is You know our Human
species I mean, you know that our nature
[SPEAKER_03]: is just very curious and we want to have
everything and we're gonna have things
[SPEAKER_03]: which are different You want to know why
they're different?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they must have you know gotten those
varieties and started cultivating them not
[SPEAKER_03]: knowing that Eventually, they will get
cross-pollinated to your regional
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties So in the end, you know what you
read what you really end up with in a way
[SPEAKER_03]: that People are not selecting After you
know after they're getting
[SPEAKER_03]: cross-pollinated because they're not
really thinking about that They're just
[SPEAKER_03]: then picking up seeds and they're growing
them and eventually what you see is you
[SPEAKER_03]: see an intermediate type of plant emerged
from this interaction Because of course
[SPEAKER_03]: there are going to be still very short
plants like Afghani varieties Which would
[SPEAKER_03]: still stay intact and you would always see
them pop up in larger populations You
[SPEAKER_03]: would also see on the other hand,
you know the thinly variety The regional
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties from Pakistan within the larger
populations of that mixed crop they will
[SPEAKER_03]: pop up but what you would see in majority
is majority you would see a plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, which is a perfect amalgamation
of both of those words and Which also seem
[SPEAKER_03]: to have certain, you know qualities which
not only make it better in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: effects or in terms of production that is
you it also, you know Makes it better in
[SPEAKER_03]: survival And you know in mitigating the
environmental risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, I'll just go this small
example and that would really you know
[SPEAKER_03]: make things more comprehensive in
Afghanistan if you go to Bulk if you go to
[SPEAKER_03]: bulk province, it's really dry arid There
is hardly any rain, you know year round
[SPEAKER_03]: and most people rely on the glacial waters
So the varieties which are growing there I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean they're not accustomed to you know
rain falling on them, especially not
[SPEAKER_03]: during the flowering time even if It does
fall in the spring So when you take those
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties to a place like Tira Valley
where you have an annual rainfall of close
[SPEAKER_03]: to 900 mm Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you're what you're really doing is
that you're really pushing that variety
[SPEAKER_03]: You know in a way that the phenotypes or
say the genotypes, you know, which are
[SPEAKER_03]: What you should say which are resistance
to mold mildew or you know mitigating
[SPEAKER_03]: these moisture related risk would then you
know excel and eventually what's gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: happen is that the plants which are not
able to mitigate those moisture related
[SPEAKER_03]: risk would die out because They will not
be able to you know, they will have bud
[SPEAKER_03]: rot and because of that their seeds Will
be less viable or viable in less numbers
[SPEAKER_03]: of what I mean to say and eventually every
year their population would decrease
[SPEAKER_03]: because of that and You know, we
understand I mean how population works and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know natural settings and eventually
what you're going to see is that only a
[SPEAKER_03]: marginal amount of you know, the original
variety that was brought from Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_03]: survives intact of course with a little
bit of change and then a little bit of you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, Pakistani would remain but What
would really overtake and what would
[SPEAKER_03]: really become of?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the whole process or what would
really emerge as the one champion in that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know a whole breeding thing is The
intermediate plant that is not only better
[SPEAKER_03]: than both parents It also has the
capabilities to mitigate all the risk and
[SPEAKER_03]: still bring all the properties from the
Afghani varieties Which which is why they
[SPEAKER_03]: actually you know in the first place got
those seeds to Pakistan so most of the
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers tend to work with those and The
interesting part is now there are some
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers which have gone a step beyond Who
have understood that you know what I could
[SPEAKER_03]: actually separate?
[SPEAKER_03]: These two varieties and I could not only
grow them separately I could have them
[SPEAKER_03]: interact or cross pollinate at my will so
that I choose you know which plants get to
[SPEAKER_03]: make the seeds and Then I would have like
a test field kind of a thing which we
[SPEAKER_03]: which in modern world we call,
you know testing for the seeds that we
[SPEAKER_03]: make and they would grow them and Then
they would select plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: which seem to show the best You know the
best features what they're looking for
[SPEAKER_03]: Regionally, whatever makes their hassel
more so it could be you it could be resin
[SPEAKER_03]: content So each one to their own but yes,
there are people who are now meticulously
[SPEAKER_03]: looking into these little aspects and you
know It just became becoming a parent to
[SPEAKER_03]: these people that you know, if they go on
selecting for better plants They
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually end up at you know better
places yield wise production wise and
[SPEAKER_02]: quality wise Yeah, of course Do you think
that the modern breeders so to speak could
[SPEAKER_02]: learn anything from the older school
farmers?
[SPEAKER_02]: have you ever stumbled upon a little patch
and kind of been impressed by a little
[SPEAKER_02]: trick or something you've seen by the
farmer and I guess as a follow-up as These
[SPEAKER_02]: more traditional farmers learn the more
modern breeding techniques Do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a risk of us maybe losing a little
something about their maybe slightly more
[SPEAKER_02]: primitive methods But maybe there's
something to it which might be lost I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: if I made some somebody's to I mean answer
this question in a very emotional
[SPEAKER_03]: political way then and of course He's
going to say yes, there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: things I mean you go back to roots and
blah blah blah But if we just break it
[SPEAKER_03]: down in a very practical manner and look
at it objectively and what do you
[SPEAKER_03]: understand is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not much that can be adopted by
the modern people because see the it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: modern people It's not like modern people
is a different species.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just That we what we are is that we
have at our disposal the collective
[SPEAKER_03]: consciousness the collective intelligence
of the entire community and that includes
[SPEAKER_03]: even those people who have no idea that
you know what they have been doing has
[SPEAKER_03]: been incorporated into the larger
understanding of how to grow plants But
[SPEAKER_03]: what we have understood that you know,
there are better ways to do that You know
[SPEAKER_03]: at the same time I mean There are
communities in India, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: which have been using, you know
lactobacillus bacteria and many other
[SPEAKER_03]: forms for You know growing the plants and
even for they spray like 5050 solution of
[SPEAKER_03]: water and milk to for the best So it's not
like these things have been invented or
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know brought by the modern
cultivators These were all like simple
[SPEAKER_03]: indigenous techniques, but at this point
At the same time they had refined them to
[SPEAKER_03]: a level and not only refined them I think
the what modern society or rather the
[SPEAKER_03]: modern community of the breeders have done
or the cultivators have done that they
[SPEAKER_03]: have You know, they have scratched the
surface beyond Indigenous communities are
[SPEAKER_03]: capable of and that is on the scientific
grounds because a lot of cultivator and
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders nowadays are like scientists
basically So they can they not only breed
[SPEAKER_03]: with those varieties grow those varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tend to I mean, you know scratch the
surface that You know what makes a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: technique work or what makes a certain
technique not work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a lot of debate that goes
around no-till and tilling the soil I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean, I know there are a lot of people who
get really, you know edgy about this kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of discussions and It is just an amazing
thing that you don't see in indigenous
[SPEAKER_03]: communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see this kind of discussions
Usually they know something, you know that
[SPEAKER_03]: has been told to them by their families by
the elders and they just Blindly kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: follow that I'm not trying to say those
are wrong things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I'm trying to say here is that
because we're not having Continued
[SPEAKER_03]: informed discussion the thing is only
getting passed down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not evolving any further It's not
evolving into something better every year
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is what has happened in the
modern society when we take up those
[SPEAKER_03]: concepts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't just sit on them You know,
we we kind of expand them and we scratch
[SPEAKER_03]: the surface and you know try to understand
why this works in this way and why not in
[SPEAKER_03]: that way and because we have the tools and
resources and You know the scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of you know, the cannabis
has increased so much in the last few
[SPEAKER_03]: years Thanks to you know, all of these
countries investing in You know the
[SPEAKER_03]: information of and dissemination of
information of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really grateful but at the same time I
mean there's a big problem because you
[SPEAKER_03]: know even in if you look At times like 70s
80s 90s in the modern society.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean there wasn't much of that happening
okay, that's only started happening like
[SPEAKER_03]: after 2000 I would say and Because during
70s and 80s the people who were growing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis were not Scientists and the
people who were scientists they would not
[SPEAKER_03]: have grown cannabis at that point in time
So that really kept cannabis away from you
[SPEAKER_03]: know scientific exposure for a very long
time But as we know later on people like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Rob Clark and a lot of other
people You know got into it and they
[SPEAKER_03]: started really, you know fixing a few
things explaining a few things and I think
[SPEAKER_03]: they have what they have done is that
we've really paved the path for other
[SPEAKER_03]: people, you know To like not think about
the stigma related to this plant But just
[SPEAKER_03]: go ahead and use your scientific expertise
and you know help the community,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know bring out more and more
information and in 2020 the situation is
[SPEAKER_03]: that you could go on Google and there are
just endless array of you know scholarly
[SPEAKER_03]: Articles you can go through about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like you know, it was never
illegal Yeah, exactly right and we
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly all stand on the shoulders of
giants like Rob Clark and people who did
[SPEAKER_02]: early contributions and it makes me wonder
were there any people in India who you
[SPEAKER_02]: looked up to as a bit of a role model or
who was doing work kind of when you're in
[SPEAKER_03]: your kind of more junior stages of things
I would say in the early life.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were some But it was not related to
cannabis, especially specifically so My
[SPEAKER_03]: mother belongs to the Chamoli district and
Chamoli district is actually the place
[SPEAKER_03]: where the chip co-movement started now I'm
gonna talk a little about chip
[SPEAKER_03]: co-movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is chip chip co-movement was it was
like a Environment and feminism kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: mixed kind of a movement So they were
cutting down trees in northwestern,
[SPEAKER_03]: Himalaya So all of these tribes and that
includes, you know The one my mother hails
[SPEAKER_03]: from they would go and they would stick to
the trees They would hug them now chip co
[SPEAKER_03]: means to like stick to something or to hug
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay in Hindi So that was the chip
co-movement So they would go and they
[SPEAKER_03]: would stick to the trees and hug them and
like ultimately that would you know enable
[SPEAKER_03]: Make it, you know impossible for the
people to cut it down So, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I was not around in 70s,
but I definitely heard great stories of
[SPEAKER_03]: you know our Ancestors, you know helping
in that movement on the other hand for my
[SPEAKER_03]: father's side, you know one of my uncles
and you know He's he's pretty famous and
[SPEAKER_03]: he has been, you know presented award by
the government as well for his work Around
[SPEAKER_03]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: His name is Jagat Singh Junglee Junglee
basically means the guy who comes from the
[SPEAKER_03]: jungle guy, right in in the so he has been
given this Salutation in a way Junglee his
[SPEAKER_03]: name was Jagat Singh and you know,
we call him Junglee that because this guy
[SPEAKER_03]: alone himself planted an entire forest one
day after the other by bringing plants one
[SPEAKER_03]: He would sometimes take ten plants
sometimes take 20 plants and in a barren
[SPEAKER_03]: place He was able to make a full-fledged
forest, which is now inhabited by a
[SPEAKER_03]: variety of you know animal and you know
birds and insect species and you know He
[SPEAKER_03]: was ultimately awarded a great honor for
doing such work around the environment and
[SPEAKER_03]: preserving these plants varieties which
grew there so that has always been you
[SPEAKER_03]: know a driving force for me that has kept
me around the plant it always told
[SPEAKER_03]: something inside always told me that if It
is something around related to the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that is, you know that that's going to be
what I'm going to do So I think that has
[SPEAKER_03]: been a great great motivation I mean not
that I want to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: bring that up to you know, really
legitimize anything but I mean that just
[SPEAKER_03]: something that is attached to my history
and you know, I'm proud of it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: totally understandable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's a really amazing story and
you bring up a really relevant point about
[SPEAKER_02]: the the destruction kind of of the natural
habitats of these cultivars Do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: people are really paying enough attention
to this and are aware of the repercussions
[SPEAKER_02]: of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: In America, I mean certainly I think
Almost everybody understands and when I
[SPEAKER_03]: say America because the community that I'm
in by and large I mean the people from
[SPEAKER_03]: America and Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically I just considered that all
Americans and even South Americans,
[SPEAKER_03]: right and some Europeans So I think in
Europe, it's even larger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry I think because of the
greenhouse seed company and you know some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the work they have done around the land
race The awareness has been a little more
[SPEAKER_03]: on the European side but because you know
all the you know Indian and you know the
[SPEAKER_03]: Pakistani and the Afghani people who are
now, you know coming on to these plants
[SPEAKER_03]: platforms With their land race varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are more connected I feel with the
the American part of the community so I
[SPEAKER_03]: think the larger way of understanding is
coming from the American side of the
[SPEAKER_03]: community, but I think for the longest
time the information has Been residing in
[SPEAKER_03]: the European community and people people
have been aware that you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is something I mean this preservation
work is important and it needs to be done
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that sort of bothers me
about that is that there are some people
[SPEAKER_03]: are not going to really name anyone here
because that really doesn't serve any
[SPEAKER_03]: purpose but some people, you know who have
been to India and you know They have
[SPEAKER_03]: collected seeds and all they have ever
done is they've just sold those varieties,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know to people and made money They've
never sent anything back to these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never spoken about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've never spoken about their problems
and They never even came back or are even
[SPEAKER_03]: in contact with these people apart from
when they really need the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So although these people have been Around
and you know, sometimes these people even
[SPEAKER_03]: you know feel the need to assert the fact
that you know They've been around for much
[SPEAKER_03]: longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know then I don't I Feel that you
know, just being around is not enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean you have to do something I mean,
you know, you have to do something that
[SPEAKER_03]: makes a difference even if even if you've
been doing for a month I don't care if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're if you've done more if you've
contributed more than you deserve You know
[SPEAKER_03]: to be at the forefront of the movement and
you know, especially the people Who are
[SPEAKER_03]: whose intentions are inclined?
[SPEAKER_03]: In the right way because you know,
this thing is this thing is very delicate,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know It can go wrong in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just not very hard to
imagine, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: so You know, we're very weary of the
people, you know, we connect with them and
[SPEAKER_03]: there were instances You know,
I got in contact with some people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know We're not exactly the kind of
people I would have worked with but well
[SPEAKER_03]: that happens I mean, you know,
you you really understand, you know that
[SPEAKER_03]: the human factor is going to play out You
know sooner or later So eventually we're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to figure out more ways to you
know, keep our rigor around preservation
[SPEAKER_03]: of the varieties So not only that we have
been, you know able to sending these
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties out to people We're also
preserving them ourselves, which I feel
[SPEAKER_03]: that at least the people who are you know,
you know selling them or what they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing whatever they're sharing them they
should they have a responsibility that if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're in a situation in a place we can
grow it you should grow it or If you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: then you can at least you know collaborate
with someone outside, you know Who is in a
[SPEAKER_03]: legal state and is able to grow them and
have them grow it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because keeping them shows that either you
want to really hoard it and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: Create some kind of pressure in the market
or some weird thing or maybe you're just
[SPEAKER_03]: not bothered You just say preservation and
you don't really understand, you know that
[SPEAKER_03]: the preservation just like the charity
begins from home Yeah, of course and I can
[SPEAKER_02]: understand why you would be concerned
about that I guess It raises an
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting question and we had a few of
our viewers ask, you know varying forms of
[SPEAKER_02]: the same question where they wanted to
basically know as Someone let's just say
[SPEAKER_02]: for example in the Western world,
you know kind of the countries you
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned, Canada USA Europe stuff like
that Someone who's living in those places.
[SPEAKER_02]: What can they do to help kind of preserve
these regional strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the best thing they can do try to get
some seeds and do a reproduction and just
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure they're around or should they
try to Caretake for a strange should they
[SPEAKER_02]: try to get over to a village and actually
physically help the village out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what you mentioned would be a nice
thing if you went there initially like
[SPEAKER_02]: what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a few things I would like to
talk here I mean the first thing is that I
[SPEAKER_03]: really want to take this opportunity
because you reminded me and want to thank
[SPEAKER_03]: the global community, especially from
Australia New Zealand Europe and very
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically from America because they
have been nothing but supportive for last
[SPEAKER_03]: Five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean if it were not for the community,
I mean the global community, you know has
[SPEAKER_03]: helped and supported You know,
we can't even like imagine doing one
[SPEAKER_03]: person of what we're doing now What people
can do there are so many things people can
[SPEAKER_03]: do I mean, you know, you could just take a
plant you could grow it and You know if
[SPEAKER_03]: you could show it to ten people even if
you don't reproduce it Let's say you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to keep a male because you have your
og and cookies going at the same time So
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to make sure it's safe So even if
you grow a land raise female and you show
[SPEAKER_03]: it To ten people then you might show it to
someone You know who may be a little more
[SPEAKER_03]: interested and then he would go on to get
those seeds and you know Grow a male and a
[SPEAKER_03]: female and preserve it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the point being is not what you have to
do the point being that you You have you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to feel that it that it's It's
priority that you have to first of all
[SPEAKER_03]: understand that there is an urgency.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is that this is not you know Like
women are getting oppressed which has been
[SPEAKER_03]: happening for like thousands of years and
would go on for a thousand more I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is something which is happening now
and it's gonna end very soon and then
[SPEAKER_03]: there will be no more of it so we have to
understand the urgency around this the
[SPEAKER_03]: preservation effort has to be a little
more than what it is right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think we're on the right track the
attitude is Absolutely fantastic and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know global community for about
preservation people just have no second
[SPEAKER_03]: thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They understand this is important,
but What people are missing on is just
[SPEAKER_03]: just talking about it and just going
making comments and you know Liking
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures and saying oh, this is the best
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not really helping anything What
you have to do is that you have to get
[SPEAKER_03]: hold of something gets get hold of
something not trying to say that buy it
[SPEAKER_03]: from me or like from some of my friends
get it from anywhere you can get it from
[SPEAKER_03]: grow it preserve it in a way get a male
and female, you know, this is I'm talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about the very basic what you could do and
You know, you could preserve it make Some
[SPEAKER_03]: notes, you know When it grew what were
what was it like, you know, how much time
[SPEAKER_03]: did it take in what smells like and all
the other aspects and that information
[SPEAKER_03]: becomes part of our collective
consciousness our collective knowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: about the land race and heirloom varieties
Which to be honest is very scarce right
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there we don't know anything about
land risk and heirloom varieties I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: most of the questions we have to say I
don't understand and you know I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to say that that is because we
don't really understand the whole thing in
[SPEAKER_03]: a very comprehensive manner as we do most
of the other things So first of all,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have to ensure we have to take every
part possible to add to the collective
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of the land race and
heirloom varieties and that could be as
[SPEAKER_03]: simple as growing one plant in your house
making all the notes about it and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: disseminating that information among at
least with 10 people the second would be
[SPEAKER_03]: to motivate other people, you know If you
are, you know smart enough if you're that
[SPEAKER_03]: intelligent guy who understands,
you know the importance around the
[SPEAKER_03]: preservation then it's your responsibility
to go out to tell other people and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, let them know about it at least make
an attempt to you know put things into
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective and you know show them why
this is really important and why this is
[SPEAKER_03]: not just You know another Heated agenda on
the horizon Well, and then there are other
[SPEAKER_03]: people, you know who are more capable who
have bigger farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have more resources So those people
should definitely be supporting these
[SPEAKER_03]: Groups and you know support anyone,
you know, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean like me or anyone but support these
guys I mean because you know That's the
[SPEAKER_03]: only way I mean you can make sure that
they stick around otherwise, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it can be hard for a lot of people I can
say that and You know because you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: have the resources and I'm now I'm talking
about these people who have big farms and
[SPEAKER_03]: resources to put behind the plants They
should be growing more of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They should be the ones who would be
should be selecting these and they should
[SPEAKER_03]: become these new people I mean you know
how there is this variety that goes around
[SPEAKER_03]: in USA I might be wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the name some kind of OG
Kush I think maybe let's just say some OG
[SPEAKER_03]: or some something which is very good which
was selected by us Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like called 78 OG FE.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Somebody that that tells me at least
it's telling me somebody in 1978 got some
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghani seeds and he was you know
intelligent enough and Resourceful enough
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow a lot of them and then select a
really nice plant that has made it down
[SPEAKER_03]: You know 30 years down, you know down the
pipe and now everybody can enjoy that But
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't we want to have more of that
won't be one won't we wish they were like
[SPEAKER_03]: so many other more people I mean that was
everything would have been you know
[SPEAKER_03]: preserved.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean isn't this the most You know
regretted thing ever by people that I wish
[SPEAKER_03]: people had you know, save the haze I wish
people had saved the skunk or like
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever else, you know, isn't this the
biggest regret in the community right now
[SPEAKER_03]: and if If you look at the nature of that
concern the nature of the concern is that
[SPEAKER_03]: you know We weren't vigilant enough to
preserve the things that we thought are
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew these things were good We still
did not preserve it So if anything,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if if anything's gonna wake us
up then it's only going to be our own
[SPEAKER_03]: history Which may be as short as like 30
30 40 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about the chemists cannabis
community But there are so many lessons to
[SPEAKER_03]: be learned that the things we lost why we
lost them and how can we make sure that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever is present now is not lost So
again for the people who think that these
[SPEAKER_03]: things will not be lost well consider this
I mean even in America where you know
[SPEAKER_03]: things You know are so much more stable
and everything there were varieties which
[SPEAKER_03]: were really good and then they got lost so
You know, I mean there is a very good
[SPEAKER_03]: possibility This this thing is not gonna
exist in like five to seven years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I could tell you right now I mean
some of them will but most of them would
[SPEAKER_03]: be gone and if not gone in a way that
they're eradicated then those varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: would not be the same because like you
mentioned earlier in the podcast That you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, it's only matter of time that some
people do get those seeds and they get
[SPEAKER_03]: mixed up It's all done for so let's do
what we can do now I mean instead of you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, telling our kids stories about these
varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's give them the seeds Let's give them
the actual plants Yeah, perfect what a
[SPEAKER_02]: what a brilliant answer for what people
can do to get on board and help out I
[SPEAKER_02]: think this would actually be a fantastic
time for you to maybe just explain for
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe the few people who aren't aware
Who's a part of the Indian Land Race
[SPEAKER_02]: Exchange?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like where they could get your seeds
from and just some stuff like that if they
[SPEAKER_02]: want to help out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay So Indian Land Race Exchange is a
collective that really looks after a few
[SPEAKER_03]: different, you know collectors And you
know if they need some kind of help that
[SPEAKER_03]: is related to seeds You know because that
also helps them in a way that financially
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just elaborate a little more like I
went to Manipur this December and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: alone and I went there and I got You know
a few hundred thousand seeds from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't need that many seeds So what I
do is I pass along some of those seeds to
[SPEAKER_03]: my friends and they have different pages
on Instagram and they can you know sell
[SPEAKER_03]: some of those seeds and whatever You know
money resource they get in turn they can
[SPEAKER_03]: then use it for the next year tours or for
you know Growing the plant that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: growing in India and you know discontinue
the whole thing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we work I Basically work in that way
and what I have is I have to immediate
[SPEAKER_03]: People who work with me one is archaic
serpent.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on Instagram as archaic serpent
rapper realms, I think and he's the guy
[SPEAKER_03]: who's from Kashmir and you know,
he does all the stuff from Kashmir
[SPEAKER_03]: basically for me and Then I have another
guy that's named red giant.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's on Instagram is red giant 92.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's He's the grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: He pretty much grows everything for me I
mean and he's a brilliant grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: He grows a lot of hybrids as well You
know, he says that he does a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the immediate team and then we
have further extension like Indian hair
[SPEAKER_03]: Indian heirloom seed company who's a great
friend of mine and lives in Bombay and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, he He has these unique varieties as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, we collaborate sometime I
give them some of the varieties I have and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, he moves them so that you know,
it helps the community as a whole so we
[SPEAKER_03]: can lift everyone and Yeah, and that's
pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean like then there are other accounts
like I can name I mean, there's my friends
[SPEAKER_03]: from a lot of Land race mafia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry because I can't really you know
remember them land race mafia So these are
[SPEAKER_03]: like young kids and one of the kid
actually was on the cover of dope magazine
[SPEAKER_03]: along with me You know because these guys
have a great relationship with you know
[SPEAKER_03]: villagers in Malana So, you know,
they have they have helped us a lot,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know get access to the Milano village
in the Milano region So later on,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I thought you know, they were
talented enough that They should be you
[SPEAKER_03]: know leading their own project and I you
know, really motivated them that you
[SPEAKER_03]: should be Try to put out some of the
varieties from your friends from Milano
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're just doing just that and
they're also trying to get to these
[SPEAKER_03]: different places, you know and try to get
hold of the other seats and of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know the Afghani guy Baba eight seven
nine I mean, you know, he's nothing short
[SPEAKER_03]: of an icon, of course and it was really
interesting, you know that in 2018 I met
[SPEAKER_03]: with him over Instagram and you know,
I try to get seeds from him and the seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: got seized in the mail because we had no
idea that they will get seized and what I
[SPEAKER_03]: had to do is I had to actually flew him
over to India along with the seeds and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's really was the first time how I got
the guy got hold of the Afghani seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: which were released in I think April 2018
to the community and then since then he
[SPEAKER_03]: has been able to expand his work
beautifully and you know, he now has
[SPEAKER_03]: access to a lot of you know European and
you know American seed banks as well who
[SPEAKER_03]: sell his you know seats.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's fantastic in the way the things
have evolved in the past few years for
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is basically the small team that
we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm sure there are a lot of people
from America that I want to name but if I
[SPEAKER_03]: start naming them in you know,
we would need like four or five more hours
[SPEAKER_03]: to complete that but I'm just gonna speak
about like maybe two or three people who
[SPEAKER_03]: have played important role.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, you know, I've been motivated a
lot by Mr. Bodhi, you know, because he
[SPEAKER_03]: even came to India, you know, for the fair
for the Kumbh Mela and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we hung out together for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he's just amazing guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he tells you all these crazy
stories from South America about DMT and
[SPEAKER_03]: all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was really cool and you know,
he gave me so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, right now I'm working with some of
the varieties, some of the varieties that
[SPEAKER_03]: I could not get like Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the Canada are black.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he got it to me and they're like
amazingly inbred as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like most of the work is done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, he's been a great help.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, I have another friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you know him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's known as bio vortex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesse dot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, I met Jesse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's he's probably one of my best
friends from America.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he's he's one of the best guys
he's had me so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, we're almost speaking on
a weekly basis and we're doing this
[SPEAKER_03]: conference and we're discussing,
you know, sometimes that I'm writing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, some of these articles and
papers I have to share with him and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so that he can do some,
you know, critique on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because see, the most needed thing
here is the motivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing you need to make sure that
people keep doing what they're doing is by
[SPEAKER_03]: making sure they're motivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, these are the people that
I'm naming right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're motivating me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have another friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: His name is he's by Dr. Green Sky,
I think, on the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how he pronounces it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he helped me a lot for like
sending money to country like Pakistan and
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghanistan, because see, we can't send
money to Pakistan because we have a very
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, politically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure you know that, like everybody
knows that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sending money there is like if you want
to get arrested, you do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have to route that money through
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just imagine it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't find people in America who's
going to risk their ass, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and send money to Pakistan because it's
just pretty similar for them as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not trying to say that someone is
bad or some country is bad or good by
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying how things politically are
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so he helps me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went he goes out of his way and he
makes sure that he's sending big amounts
[SPEAKER_03]: of money to Pakistan, which is perhaps
risky even for him to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he does that because he want to make
sure that this thing is done.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole circle is completed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he also was receiving seeds for me
because if I try to get seeds from
[SPEAKER_03]: Pakistan, they get busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to get them to America and then
I have to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to get those seeds from America to
India.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, he's been helping me and he's
yeah, he's a busy guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, it's not like he's not a
busy person.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a very busy person.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has several projects of his own and so
much work, but he makes sure that he takes
[SPEAKER_03]: out some time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like I said, the preservation or the
helping doesn't necessarily needs to come
[SPEAKER_03]: in the form of you buying seed or you
growing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be so many things that you could
enable other people to do or put them in a
[SPEAKER_03]: situation where they could do more for
themselves and ultimately, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: contribute to the larger community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one more person I want to name is
would be I don't know his name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never asked him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's mass medical strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know his real name,
but he's a fantastic guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have lovely conversations around the
plant, very spiritual kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: conversations and very philosophical as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we agreed that I had a
plant, you know, you know, that I feel was
[SPEAKER_03]: really special.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I didn't have enough seeds
to release to everyone because then some
[SPEAKER_03]: people really get angry because there are
very few seeds and I can't get them to
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I did was I just reproduce like a
bunch of seeds about like 100,
[SPEAKER_03]: 150.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I gave the F1 seeds to,
you know, mass medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I told him like, hey, you know,
you can grow them and you're going to find
[SPEAKER_03]: like the sativa ones and like the indigo
ones, like the, you know, tall ones and
[SPEAKER_03]: the short ones as you want to classify
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can either segregate them into
different, you know, tangents and breed
[SPEAKER_03]: them separately, or you could just
amalgamate everything and just make a very
[SPEAKER_03]: homogeneous mix of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just distribute it to
people and put it into people's hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he's he's a great grower
and, you know, he makes, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of seeds available to a lot of
people through a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: American seed banks.
[SPEAKER_03]: American venues.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought I should give it over to him
and he would be the more responsible and
[SPEAKER_03]: better person to work with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he's doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, that's just another unique way
how, you know, he's contributing to the
[SPEAKER_03]: big effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really thankful.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some people who are helping me
in the library project as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some people from a fish in
Ottawa state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't remember the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a woman and, you know, she's helping
at Torrey Gates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's helping me a lot with the
library project as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to make a cannabis library in
Himalayas in my hometown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we're going to put together
a lot of agriculture related books and
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis related books.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's been helping me collect all
these book donations and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: just helping overall with the morale and
motivation, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, lots of help.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, there's so many other
people I want to talk about, but,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's just not practical to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these are the people I can think of
really who are involved in the movement
[SPEAKER_03]: with us in a larger way and are making a
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a really comprehensive answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you brought up a favorite of
the show, Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone loves Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a bit of a common sentiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you know, it's so funny you
mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was only talking to Mass Medical Strains
just yesterday about just general stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he brought up that collab you were
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wanted to know, what can you tell
me about the Swabhi line you sent him?
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you hope to do more collabs going
forward?
[SPEAKER_03]: Swabhi line is a really special one and
for a few different reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I talk about my father's side of the
family, they were not necessarily from
[SPEAKER_03]: India.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 1947, India and Pakistan became two
different countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point in time, my father's
family, you know, they moved from Pakistan
[SPEAKER_03]: and they used to live in Swabhi.
[SPEAKER_03]: They moved to Rajasthan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from Rajasthan, they moved to
Uttarakhand, where they found the
[SPEAKER_03]: environment was pretty much similar to
where they had come from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they kind of settled there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after a couple of generations,
you know, everybody was speaking the
[SPEAKER_03]: language and they had completely,
you know, become a part of the larger,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Garhwali or the Uttarakhand
culture that there is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was able to make a friend in 2000.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was around end of 2016 in
Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he sent me some seeds from
Swabhi and that was really special for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kept those seeds in refrigerator for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 2019, I brought them outside when I
had the resource and I was sure that if I
[SPEAKER_03]: grow them, I can, you know, like make sure
that, you know, I flower them and I make
[SPEAKER_03]: the seeds and do everything that is
required to reproduce and preserve it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I grew a few of those and what I did
basically was I excluded all the longer
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering, you know, females which were
present in the population.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I only selected the ones which are
flowering faster and had copious resin
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used two different males.
[SPEAKER_03]: One male had an amazing vigor.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other male didn't have great vigor,
but it had visible, you know, trichomes on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, that was a plus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to use it and see if that
really translates into something else,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it surely does because when I grew the
f1s here last year, then I saw that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, most of the f1s that came up,
they were just way more resinous than what
[SPEAKER_03]: I had originally selected that population
out of.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for that reason, it's a very
interesting population.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now the question is why there are some
short flowering and why there are some
[SPEAKER_03]: longer flowering varieties within that one
population, especially if it is
[SPEAKER_03]: domesticated in a place like Pakistan?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the answer is that Swabhi is a place
which is like really at the edge of Khyber
[SPEAKER_03]: Pakhtunkhwa near like Mardan and Punjab.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while you're just, it's sort of a place
while you're like getting down from the
[SPEAKER_03]: mountains and, you know, you're going
towards more hotter, more temperate
[SPEAKER_03]: climates, which are also flatland
territories.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have the wider varieties which are
growing out there are pretty much similar
[SPEAKER_03]: to the Indian varieties, which are
thin-leaved and, you know, they flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like 14, 15 weeks and, you know,
they seem to have a very unpredictable way
[SPEAKER_03]: of producing THC, CBD or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what people did in Swabhi was just like
everyone else in Pakistan, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they got their seeds from Afghanistan or
someplace like Uzbekistan where they can
[SPEAKER_03]: get the seeds which, you know,
grow plants that flower very short and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, have all those desirable effects
that we know of from the short flowering
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem was what they did not
account for was once again, the wilder
[SPEAKER_03]: population growing around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because there's no one stopping that,
they keep interacting with each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, if you see on an overall basis,
the flowering still remains short and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the resin production is pretty
much there because, you know, the domestic
[SPEAKER_03]: population after all is being taken care
of, even though it is getting pollinated
[SPEAKER_03]: with the one which is wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, the wild variety is the
farthest thing from a true breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: While your domesticated one isn't either a
true breeding variety exactly,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it still is a little more homogeneous
than the other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it tends to dominate overall,
but you still see a lot of, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, longer flowering plants,
not to the extent that 14, 15 weeks,
[SPEAKER_03]: but yeah, about like 11, 12 weeks,
you see them and you see they have a
[SPEAKER_03]: significantly more stretch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a matter of fact, I would say even
the ones that you would consider short
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering or indigo in a way, even they
have significantly more stretch compared
[SPEAKER_03]: to a pure Afghani variety or a pure
variety brought from a place like
[SPEAKER_03]: Uzbekistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of diversity going in there and
the smells are just amazing because you'll
[SPEAKER_03]: be getting a lot of spices.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the thing about Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of varieties that come from Pakistan
have this spicy flavor and it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: delectable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you just fall in love with it,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the spice is going to be there in an
overwhelming fashion and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: coupled with like raw mango.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even Mass Medical told me that,
you know, he was getting some rubbery
[SPEAKER_03]: tones and something like onion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, well, let's see, you know,
how it really develops and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: because he's really growing them out big
and yeah, we'll really see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really excited to see how they
test and what kind of phytochemical
[SPEAKER_03]: composition comes up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, number wise, if there is some
CBD present or even some other rare,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, cannabinoids present in that
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that all remains to be seen,
but so far the developments are good and
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Medical has also gone ahead and,
you know, taken the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_03]: pollinate some of his, you know,
staple varieties with Swabi and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, eventually work on those lines
and see if he can release some of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be great for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm always open for, you know,
collaboration, but like I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, there's this big factor,
human factor, you know, that we have to be
[SPEAKER_03]: careful about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to be careful, you know,
who we're working with and that our
[SPEAKER_03]: intentions are in tune.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we both have the same goal in
mind and not that, you know, one person is
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking something and the other person is
thinking something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many varieties that I have,
you know, which I cannot release because
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not, you know, good numbers,
but eventually I'll find people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, good people who will,
who would be responsible enough to take
[SPEAKER_03]: them and reproduce, preserve, and then
distribute them to the community so that
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody can enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think likewise, we're going to wait
and see all the awesome stuff to come from
[SPEAKER_02]: that CoLab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm interested to know, do you have a
certain type of breeding style you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And by that, I mean, do you like to cross
different land races together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you prefer to just reproduce them and
just kind of hunt within the one line?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your preferred kind of way of doing
it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because see, I mean, I'm not a
trained breeder or, I mean, because I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been only doing it for a few years,
but I mean, I've had a background in
[SPEAKER_03]: science and, you know, I also studied,
you know, cognitive psychology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have a master's degree in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've done a lot of, you know,
research and we understand how the recent
[SPEAKER_03]: methodology, you know, works.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that pretty much remains the same
wherever you go, even though, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: plant breeding is quite a different thing
when you compare it to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: other things like psychology.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you are curious and you understand,
you know, how to perform experiments to
[SPEAKER_03]: reach at different conclusions,
how to form hypotheses and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: how to prove and disprove them yourself,
it's eventually going to help you,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, get at positions where you know
more than, you know, somebody who's just
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at the plant in a much simplistic
manner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there are a few different things that
I like to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I'm a really fan of,
like, pedigree breeding, but that's more
[SPEAKER_03]: for, like, the monoecious varieties,
you know, which has male and female on the
[SPEAKER_03]: same plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it pertains more to that because you
could self-pollinate those in a way,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, which is not really conducive
for varieties like cannabis, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even in cannabis, you could do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically what that means is you're
going to trace the pedigree so all the
[SPEAKER_03]: characteristics that you see in a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let me just start over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you have, let's say,
two plants that you cross together,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have two land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say I have Kandahar Black and I have
PCK and I cross them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is going to happen is that I'm
going to see the progeny and the progeny
[SPEAKER_03]: will have a few different things,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: What it's going to have is some of the
progeny is going to look like the male,
[SPEAKER_03]: some of them are going to look like
female, and some of them will have a
[SPEAKER_03]: co-dominant expression, which will be an
amalgamation of both of the parents in
[SPEAKER_03]: varying manners.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're working with varieties
which are highly inbred, which have been
[SPEAKER_03]: homogenized for certain traits,
like I'm going to talk about Pakistani
[SPEAKER_03]: Chitral Kish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now Pakistani Chitral Kish is so inbred,
I mean, that it's so homogeneous for that
[SPEAKER_03]: trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the way it grows and everything
that no matter what you cross it with,
[SPEAKER_03]: it just completely takes it over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just knocks off the other, you know,
alleles and just takes over completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know about the Kandahar Black,
but I grew only about like five to seven
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and I could see that almost every
plant was identical in the way they would
[SPEAKER_03]: acquire, you know, colors and,
you know, way they would grow in a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that made me understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, again, this is also a very inbred
variety and pretty homogeneous for the
[SPEAKER_03]: trait black leaf, if not anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just thought, you know, we just cross
these two varieties and the predictability
[SPEAKER_03]: is going to be really high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for someone who's working in small
spaces like me, I mean, I don't have like
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking farms here, like I'm growing
plants at, but I have enough space to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, do my breeding work in a
meticulous and in an honest manner.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to readily choose plants or the
parents when I will be able to greatly
[SPEAKER_03]: predict the outcome because I don't have
really have the space to see what's
[SPEAKER_03]: happening every time by growing 200
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I run into varieties like Hindu
Kush, let's just say when I was growing
[SPEAKER_03]: Hindu Kush, and the first thing that I saw
was, again, that there are these three
[SPEAKER_03]: different, you know, expressions there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first is a narrow leaf that
corresponds to the primordial state of
[SPEAKER_03]: that plant because they were all narrow
leaf before they got domesticated and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have the domesticated
variety, which is of course, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: the broad leaf variety, you know,
the perfect structure and everything that
[SPEAKER_03]: we recognize as the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there is intermediate variety,
which is just between both of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has, you know, certain features from
both of those varieties in varying
[SPEAKER_03]: manners.
[SPEAKER_03]: So soon as I saw that, I thought if I want
the narrow leaf trait to carry on into my
[SPEAKER_03]: projects, then I can't just take this very
plant and, you know, start, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: crossing it to everything else because
this is a part of a very, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a very heterogeneous, you know,
population.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just not something,
you know, which is consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not dominant in the population.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it were dominant, then I would see it
pop up a lot more often like the broad
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then the only option you have,
then it's not really a matter of what you
[SPEAKER_03]: like to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only option you have is to take that
plant, you know, and find another plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, its counterpart, which is as
closely related to it physically in other
[SPEAKER_03]: aspects, smell and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you start in breeding them
selectively.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you do that until you reach a,
you know, situation where almost every
[SPEAKER_03]: plant comes out like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened in four generation,
five generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on the variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on, you know, how well you're
selecting it and a lot of other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once you do get to that point,
then you have once again reached a
[SPEAKER_03]: situation of that PCK into Gandhar kind of
situation, because now you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: Hindukush variety that is going to act as
a true breeding variety because it has
[SPEAKER_03]: been, you know, homogenized for all of
those traits in it over generations by
[SPEAKER_03]: selectively in breeding it with closely
related individuals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if I take that Hindukush and I cross
it with something else, then I can be sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that these traits will show up in an
overwhelming proportion, at least in the
[SPEAKER_03]: F1 generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the selection work is going to
be, you know, really easy, or you could
[SPEAKER_03]: just, you know, cross pollinate the F1
generation, get to the F2, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then select from an even more diverse
population.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, there is no fixed rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no rights and wrongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can cross land races to land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can cross land race to hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do whatever you want, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You will end up making seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some plants will come out of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want to work in a way,
you know, that is predictable and that
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of creates like a feedback loop that
your own work has to give you a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_03]: That what you were expecting, yes,
you're able to see that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, again, if the Kandahar
Black and PCK cross does not show in F1
[SPEAKER_03]: population, you know, what I'm expecting
to see, then that tells me that something
[SPEAKER_03]: went wrong in the parental generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I can go back and, you know,
I can figure it out what it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: although I'm pretty sure that's not going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I'm trying to say here is that it
really depends on where you're trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: reach.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to reach somewhere where
you want to be confident in giving out
[SPEAKER_03]: your seeds and letting people know what
they would be like, then well,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the way of working that you have to
either find true breeding varieties or you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to find varieties and, you know,
make them breed true for, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: trades by in breeding them and just a lot
of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it has to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the market situation is completely
different for people in US and Europe
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're constantly competing with
so many other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, so the actions are pretty
much predicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: By, you know, what's market, what market
is doing, what what's good in the market
[SPEAKER_03]: more than what they want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of sad at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, people have to put food on
their table.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I'm not going to go ahead and
blame someone for like not doing the work
[SPEAKER_03]: that way should be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, there are there are
no rights or wrongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you do what you you can do and
then you try to reach at a place where
[SPEAKER_03]: people can appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understandably, people have got to provide
for themselves and their family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to kind of tie up two little things,
I was wondering about your breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, given what you just said,
do you tend to like to select just one
[SPEAKER_02]: male to pollinate females or do you like
to use a few?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as a follow up, do you keep any
cuttings at all, either male or female?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to select a few males always.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at least three four or five,
depending on the population as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I mean it again, it really depends what
you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's let's say if I'm working with low
lab belly that I and my friend archaic
[SPEAKER_03]: serpent were.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we saw there is a staggering amount of
variability present within the larger
[SPEAKER_03]: population.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had no option, but we had to select
five different males.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we had to narrow it down to one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This took around like three months of
distressing those males and just trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: see if there's any latent interest in the
sex trade that might pop up later.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really depends what I'm trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I'm working with, let's say PCK,
then I don't really need to have like 20
[SPEAKER_03]: different males really.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it doesn't really make a lot of
sense, but I'm sure you could,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, increase the probability of your
results in a better way if you have more
[SPEAKER_03]: males.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do understand that, but I think a
more, I think a more we should say a more
[SPEAKER_03]: in tune way with your process,
or I would say a more of a that would,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, take you towards your goal has
to be taken by people rather than what
[SPEAKER_03]: would appeal to people as you're doing
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I see that some people would go
and do things because they feel that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, this would drive people's
opinion in us, you know, in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would make them feel that I'm doing
the right things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you always and always have to
choose over, you know, you have to choose
[SPEAKER_03]: what you want to do over what would drive
other people's, you know, opinions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you could, I mean, it's very hard
to explain in words for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, English not being my first
language, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I'm trying to say here is this
that, you know, that the male selections,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, because most people,
you know, who are growing, like selecting
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 males, they never tell you like what
they're selecting for and how they're
[SPEAKER_03]: selecting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I see some people say that,
you know, if your male, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: drops the pollen late, and that's a good
male, or you have to find a male that has
[SPEAKER_03]: a big cluster on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All valid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they make sense,
you know, all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't see people like, you know,
when they're working with a population
[SPEAKER_03]: that taking notes of the females,
you know, the females you like,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's say you like four females in a
population, then you have to take notes
[SPEAKER_03]: from the beginning that what is the,
you know, difference between their
[SPEAKER_03]: internodes, you know, their life,
their leaf surface area, and all of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you will be finding males.
[SPEAKER_03]: That exact thing is going to help you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That data is going to help you determine
which are those males which will be
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect, which will be synonymous to the
females that you have selected.
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead of just relying on something like
a bigger, you know, cluster on the male
[SPEAKER_03]: or, you know, it has a dense stem or
something of that sort, which is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you should do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, if you're maintaining data
from your female selections, then you can
[SPEAKER_03]: just take that physical data, apply it to
the male, and see which males have that
[SPEAKER_03]: exact structure and all those traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, these plants are the
closest to the females you've selected,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you could do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think more than in numbers,
it is about how to select the male that is
[SPEAKER_03]: more important, because you could have
10,000 males and yet not have a clue how
[SPEAKER_03]: to select the right one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very astute point to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you know, while we only just
talked about Bodhi just a minute ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to use him as a good little segue
into my next question, which is when you
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of travel around and you go and visit
different places, do you predominantly
[SPEAKER_02]: trek between them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that like a style of travel that
you enjoy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I just remember Bodhi is so fond
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have to trek.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, most of these places are not
accessible by roads.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of the places you have to trek.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Himachal Pradesh is fairly easy because
you get, if you want to go to the Malana,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get to the last point with your car.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's only about two kilometers to
the village and two kilometers to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Wai Chin Valley and about
another kilometer to Magic Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vailing Valley is a little farther.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about like eight to nine kilometers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody's not even welcome there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, like most people don't go.
[SPEAKER_03]: But apart from that, I mean, it's pretty
much easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you go to places like Uttarakhand or,
you know, northern Kashmir, then there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: whole lot more, you know, walking involved
because the roads are just not paved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those places are not getting the kind of
revenue and tourism that Himachal Pradesh
[SPEAKER_03]: is getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the development is pretty
much, you know, in sync with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as much the revenue the state's
going to have, I mean, they will only be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to spend that and sometimes not even
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Kashmir and Uttarakhand, it's going to
be really taxing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you're not the kind of person
who likes to walk, then you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have a very hard time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of the altitude, I mean,
it's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I have met some people
who've come from like America.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I had this guy in 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he came from America and we took him
to, you know, Uttarakhand and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I took him to Kashmir and I took
him to, you know, Himachal Pradesh as well
[SPEAKER_03]: in Malanaya.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he had a great time,
but again, it got really taxing and tiring
[SPEAKER_03]: for that person because, you know,
he was just not, you know, used to walking
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot on a daily basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and another thing is when you're doing
this, you have a very short window.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you have this window of 15 September
to sort of like 30th October because most
[SPEAKER_03]: of the harvest is going to happen between
that and you have to make it out to all of
[SPEAKER_03]: these places, at least to the three
Himalayan states and have to be present
[SPEAKER_03]: there, you know, while it's going down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's important to, you know,
plan very meticulously how you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: go about your, you know, hunts every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every year we make a calendar at least
four months prior, at least five months
[SPEAKER_03]: prior.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that, you know, what places
we're going to go to this year and what
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly are we going to cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, if you're going to make
some kind of video, like we did one in
[SPEAKER_03]: Kashmir, you know, we covered how they
make hash traditionally by cooking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we write a storyboard for that and we
make sure that, you know, we know exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: what to do at that point in time because
it's all happening live and if you miss
[SPEAKER_03]: it, then you miss it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just have to be prepared and the
presence of mind is of the essence while
[SPEAKER_03]: conducting this kind of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hiking and walking is basically a very
integral part as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're not up for that,
you're probably going to have a very hard
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understandable, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I think back to Bodhi talking
about the trekking, he often speaks about
[SPEAKER_02]: it as though there's like a spiritual
aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the cannabis and hashish you
sample along the way is really special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that kind of the way you think about
it, or is it more just like a means to an
[SPEAKER_02]: end to get the seeds for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a deep spiritual aspect attached
to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to be clear and this has
nothing to do with the religion or the God
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm saying spirituality, I just mean
to say a higher understanding and a higher
[SPEAKER_03]: awareness of you and your surroundings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there are two very important
things that happen when you go out on
[SPEAKER_03]: these treks, especially if you're alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: First is that you are in a serene
environment that is very hard to come by
[SPEAKER_03]: in, you know, a chaotic life in places
like India.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you are actually physically in a
place or in a situation where you can
[SPEAKER_03]: reflect back to things in your life,
reflect back to things that you see in
[SPEAKER_03]: nature and you can connect with them
because there's nobody around you to judge
[SPEAKER_03]: you or to call you crazy or any of that
sort of thing that we seem to be really
[SPEAKER_03]: worried and preoccupied about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other aspect of it is the
awareness of the surrounding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, without going out in the nature
and you could call it data collection in a
[SPEAKER_03]: way, in a very crude manner, and you could
also call it increasing the awareness of
[SPEAKER_03]: your surroundings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So both are correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that can only happen when
you're venturing to these places where
[SPEAKER_03]: there are no roads, because see,
if there is a road somewhere, let's
[SPEAKER_03]: understand this, that place has already
been ventured and you can probably find
[SPEAKER_03]: that information somewhere on Google.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you go to places where you don't
have a road and you're hiking into these
[SPEAKER_03]: mountains, to these valleys, well,
surely enough, you're going to run into
[SPEAKER_03]: places and you're going to run into
cultures and people and resin and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, alcohols and honey.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, sometimes they make butter
from indigenous milk and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of those experiences, you know,
you will always be devoid of that if you
[SPEAKER_03]: are not attempting to go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if some person, especially somebody who
lives in America or lives in a country
[SPEAKER_03]: where, you know, these kind of experiences
are scarce to come by and they do make a
[SPEAKER_03]: journey like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what possibility do you think
there is that it does not have a
[SPEAKER_03]: spiritual, deep spiritual impact on that
person?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you basically have to be like,
you know, a non-human entity, not to be
[SPEAKER_03]: moved by the beauty of the nature that is
present in Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if you've been here,
but it's absolutely breathtaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've only lived all my life here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every time I go, I'm just dumbstruck,
you know, looking at the nature around me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, like you said, I mean, you know,
Bodhi really, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: puts it in a very eloquent manner that I
might not be able to put it across in that
[SPEAKER_03]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the gist of the story is he's just as
interested in hiking and in the journey as
[SPEAKER_03]: much as he's interested in getting to the
destination and then doing the thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the attitude that we need to
have and not because that it's something
[SPEAKER_03]: spiritual.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, this is the same thing
that is going to help you with your data
[SPEAKER_03]: collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're aware and sensitive all the
time, if you're receptive of your
[SPEAKER_03]: surroundings and you're hiking,
you're not going by a motor car or by a
[SPEAKER_03]: bus, you know, you're walking slowly and
you're taking information as our senses
[SPEAKER_03]: are evolved to, you know, at medium
speeds, at medium sizes, then we will be
[SPEAKER_03]: taking a lot more and we will be imbibing
all this in broad data from nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because there are no roads,
so we might be getting in, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: more or newer information, which you could
then process in your own way, use your
[SPEAKER_03]: intelligence, what you make of it and
present it to the community, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: who are not geographically blessed enough
to be in those places so frequently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's really what it's all
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think he puts it in a very
beautifully and a very simple,
[SPEAKER_03]: it puts it very simply, but there is a
deep, deep meaning to that, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, Bodhi actually gave me two
questions to ask you, so we may as well
[SPEAKER_02]: roll into him seeing as we're here and he
wants to know first off, what's the most
[SPEAKER_02]: psychoactive Indian heirloom strain you've
been able to try?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the most...
[SPEAKER_03]: So the most, I mean, this is a tricky
question, but I'm going to say Manipuri,
[SPEAKER_03]: the one that comes from northeast of
India, Manipur, and especially the one
[SPEAKER_03]: that we recently got from eastern
Manipur-Burma border.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't understand the reasons why,
because, you know, again, the
[SPEAKER_03]: domestication is pretty much, you know,
of the same standard as it is in rest of
[SPEAKER_03]: the North India.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the varieties that seem to come from
these places northeast of India seem to
[SPEAKER_03]: have a really, you know, intense high,
if not more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a little theory, and this might
be wrong, but I'll just tell you what I
[SPEAKER_03]: think about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I think about this is that the
eastern part of India is where,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is like quite close to the equator,
near the south and the east part,
[SPEAKER_03]: the southeast part, where Orissa is and
Andhra is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those places are very close to
northeast India.
[SPEAKER_03]: And northeast India is also close to the
northwestern, you know, Himalayan regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it, in a way, is a sandwich between
these two places.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, I mean, it could be that,
you know, people from, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: different places like east and north went
out there, migrated, and they may have
[SPEAKER_03]: contributed somehow, you know,
in what makes up the natural population
[SPEAKER_03]: out there today.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also understand this as a matter of
fact that, you know, the mild tribes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, of the Tangkols, and they have
descended from the Burmese people,
[SPEAKER_03]: and specifically the Burmese people of the
Tibetan descent, Tibetan-Chinese descent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the migration pattern that has
been traced.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have been able to trace it
because of the language, because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: way, you know, the languages they speak,
and these are different dialects,
[SPEAKER_03]: so they can understand that this dialect
evolved properly from this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that really paints the picture of the
migration for northeast of India.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those people have come through the ways
of China.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if they bring varieties
from China or Tibet along with them,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then it gets mixed along with the
general population, which is just entirely
[SPEAKER_03]: different because of being, you know,
a very tropical-like climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it seemed to have an amazing
unparalleled high, at least if you,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, compare it to any other variety
in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Kashmiris can be quite strong,
but they're not psychoactive in a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I wouldn't call them like,
they don't have that psychedelic kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: edge to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're more like a, they're a
different kind of high, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: which could more be associated to like
broad leaf plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, northeast India varieties,
Manipur, eastern Manipur, Burmese
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically, I think would be the most or
the best in terms of high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really solid answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the second question he asked was,
do you think that the high elevation
[SPEAKER_02]: Himalayan cannabis differ in effect from
the tropical, more sea level specimens?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think that it's because of
maybe the UV that it creates a little
[SPEAKER_02]: something special?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why he asked is because he
said he knows of some barbers who just
[SPEAKER_02]: want to try to find cannabis from like the
highest elevation possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we did bring this up in
conversation somewhere previously that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, about the UV radiation when I
was speaking about the highland varieties,
[SPEAKER_03]: which also grew in the high latitude
regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they seem to be getting a lot more
exposure of, you know, UV rays than any
[SPEAKER_03]: other place in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is that something that makes the plant
behave in a different way phytochemically?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can't say yes or no to that
because I don't have any tests to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, fall back on or any kind of
study.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I can tell you for sure is that
the varieties that tend to grow at higher
[SPEAKER_03]: altitudes or, you know, high latitudes,
especially, they seem to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they seem to produce, like we said before,
a competitively dense coverage of resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the resin glands seem to be
bigger and, you know, it just seems to be
[SPEAKER_03]: more potent in the way, you know,
overall in the way they make you feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this would, you know, encompass India
in the way that I'm talking that when I
[SPEAKER_03]: say highland high latitude, that would
include everything from central to
[SPEAKER_03]: Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in India itself as well, if you go to
places like northern Kashmir, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's at 34 degrees north and then you have
altitude of like 3000 plus meters,
[SPEAKER_03]: just more than 10,000 feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you definitely see that there are
certain plants there, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are just insane to simply say the
least.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think because of those babas that
Bodhi is referring to, they have been to
[SPEAKER_03]: all of these places because these babas
are just about getting, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: getting to all the places, to highest of
the mountains, to the lowest of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cities, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they know, they know the higher up
they're out there is, are the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: populations which seem to have,
you know, bigger trichomes and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, larger density of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're rubbing the plants,
you can probably get the same thing done
[SPEAKER_03]: within 10 minutes instead of doing it an
hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're working with those varieties,
if you're working with varieties in low
[SPEAKER_03]: land in places like Punjab, you may have
to spend like three to four hours before
[SPEAKER_03]: you can get anything at all in your hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think they tend to have that
understanding, maybe not in a way that we
[SPEAKER_03]: would like to think about it, but,
you know, as always, indigenous cultures
[SPEAKER_03]: and these primitive cultures, they knew so
much because they didn't have these
[SPEAKER_03]: distractions of, you know, all the
societies and the markets and these phones
[SPEAKER_03]: and laptops and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they could rely, they used to rely on
their natal, their innate senses so much
[SPEAKER_03]: more often than we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, we were just not able
to, you know, think in those ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's all always a great idea to
take advice from your elders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially those elders see happens to
be some, you know, chill I'm smoking Baba.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Bodhi knows, I mean,
what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he's been here, you know,
so many times in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he pretty much understands India very
well, because when he was here,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, he's not asking me that,
you know, how to get around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he pretty much knows everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, when I was in the Mela,
he was able to show me some of the things,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that I would have missed,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what a testament to the guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to kind of wrap up this section on
kind of the little trekking stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's one of the most memorable smokes
you've had while doing the trekking
[SPEAKER_02]: around?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a follow-up, do you have any kind
of crazy stories from while you were
[SPEAKER_02]: trekking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm just going to answer that all in
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this just happened now last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So last year around the month of end of
July or beginning of August, India made a
[SPEAKER_03]: huge change in the way, you know,
the things are in Jammu and Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_03]: We kind of took hold of Kashmir entirely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our government, I'm not going to go into
whether that's right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's their thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a lot of tension there,
a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was locked up for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was there before that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like really hard for me to get
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got out somehow on the 6th of the
August and I was home.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was really, you know, thankful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to come back.
[SPEAKER_03]: But see what happens is three months down
the line, things got a little eased up on
[SPEAKER_03]: 10th of October.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, OK, we're going to open it for
the tourists once again so you guys can
[SPEAKER_03]: come.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody's going to Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, of course, nobody wants to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my friend is like, hey, so you guys
are like coming over or what?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, I want to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, the situation, I mean,
aren't you watching the news and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, these news guys are crazy,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing happened here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just come over.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have officially opened for the
tourism.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should be OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the flight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did the Srinagar thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smooth sailing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to Dachiham National Park.
[SPEAKER_03]: Smooth sailing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got all the samples, pictures,
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we moved to northern Kashmir and I'm
really happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to the Lolab Valley and I'm
going to go to those spots where,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, my friend got the seats last
year and I will get to see those in person
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have to, first of all,
let me put things in perspective a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lolab Valley is just like three to four
hills away from Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, and not only that it's at the border.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a de facto border.
[SPEAKER_03]: What that means is that there is no actual
border.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just assumed that there is somewhere a
border in between and you just don't
[SPEAKER_03]: cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very often what happens is that you
wouldn't realize and you would just cross
[SPEAKER_03]: over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, well, that would be, you know,
a very bad story to tell in the end if you
[SPEAKER_03]: survive too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we were there and, you know,
we were rubbing hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were actually 12 people because we had
an entire team from Lolab.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had like seven guys from Srinagar and
some from the Lolab.
[SPEAKER_03]: Locals and we were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were rubbing hash and, you know,
I was collecting samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made several videos and even posted that
when we were almost done and we were
[SPEAKER_03]: coming down.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is an Indian army post there.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so they were they were wired.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, somebody did a wireless to them
that there are like about 10 to 12 people
[SPEAKER_03]: they can see on the top of the hill and
they're like coming down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we were descending down the first
meadow that came, there were these two
[SPEAKER_03]: guys from SOG that is special operation
group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let me tell you something about
special operation group.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're just asked to shoot people
if they think that they should be shot and
[SPEAKER_03]: no question asked.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they had their guns and, you know,
they they made us sit there and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they everybody just went around
telling them that how they are just from,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, this local place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even the guys from Srinagar had some
relatives living in this place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were like almost all off the hook.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was natural for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so you guys are not coming from the
Pakistan or, you know, something fishy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when they got to me and they asked me
where I'm from and I told them that I've
[SPEAKER_03]: come from Punjab and these guys were
absolutely this absolutely lost their
[SPEAKER_03]: mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, well, man, like,
are you not watching the news or like,
[SPEAKER_03]: do you not live in this world or what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you first of all, you don't come to
Kashmir in time like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do come to Kashmir,
you stick to the lake or to the Srinagar
[SPEAKER_03]: to the southern part.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't freaking come to the northern
Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if you come to northern Kashmir
and this is exactly how he said,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not in English, but even if you
come to northern Kashmir, then you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: climb up the mountain and you don't try
to, you know, get close to the border
[SPEAKER_03]: region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, how dare you?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been here for 10 years, you know,
serving an army within just the Kashmir
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've never got my family here to show
them around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had the courage to got my
family here to show them around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look at you like what are you even
doing here?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we just kind of told him like
what exactly I was doing there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I had to tell him because,
you know, I wasn't doing something that I
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't proud of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the good thing there is like they're
not the kind of they're not like police.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not worried about hash or weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like none of their concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their only concern is the security that
who are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are you coming from?
[SPEAKER_03]: And why are you here when you're not
supposed to be on top of these mountains?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that thing went on for about,
I don't know, two, two and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they scared the shit out of
me, you know, but I think at some point I
[SPEAKER_03]: had like kind of understood that they will
eventually let me go because most of the
[SPEAKER_03]: guys that we were there with, not only
that they were local, but their fathers
[SPEAKER_03]: are in army, you know, in certain
different regiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that helps them, you know, build on the
confidence that, okay, these people are
[SPEAKER_03]: not, you know, anti-social elements or
someone who's here to do something bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just young guys who want to smoke
and, you know, that was one incident.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, one hell of an incident.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you're just sitting there and they
took our pictures, they took our IDs and
[SPEAKER_03]: they had this machine where they could
scan our IDs and they figure out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they could check that number
with the data, government database,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether or not these are like fake or
these are like the real IDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they did everything that they could and
they took our phone numbers, our
[SPEAKER_03]: addresses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was only after that that they let
us go.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing I got down at the Lullabh
Valley floor, I got into the car with my
[SPEAKER_03]: friend and we left and we only stopped at
Srinagar, not before that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about 120, 30 kilometers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although there were a lot of stoppages in
between.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is like a very usual thing for
Kashmir that you travel like 10
[SPEAKER_03]: kilometers, then you stop for the army and
then just happens like that everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was, that would be one incident
that I'm never going to forget and
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely something to be spoken about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I would have been in the same boat
as you quite worried.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm only just in this moment realizing
that I haven't asked you at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you in general tend to prefer like more
kind of uplifting highs or more kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: sedating?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like, I like more sedative highs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that helps you relax because I
don't smoke much during the daytime.
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually begin my morning and then I try
to refrain from smoking till six or seven
[SPEAKER_03]: in the evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just gradually start hitting
some bongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I really feel an urge,
I really feel an urge to smoke is when I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: going to sleep because I have some issues
relating sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm always just looking for
varieties that can help me accomplish or
[SPEAKER_03]: help me just mitigate those issues that I
have around the sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm always inclined towards finding
varieties which are more sedative in
[SPEAKER_03]: nature and would make you feel sleepy,
which is also one of the reasons why I
[SPEAKER_03]: tend to get some of my resin or cerasin
bulk and try to cure it for the longer
[SPEAKER_03]: durations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then even if the plants naturally
are not plant predominant we do not
[SPEAKER_03]: produce a narcotic effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can actually cure the hash in a way and
get it to a point where it would induce
[SPEAKER_03]: that sort of sleepy effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I can certainly relate to
many aspects of that answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I wanted to ask you a little bit
about was kind of the general smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: culture in India.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess specifically, is tobacco
normally mixed with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a follow-up, are there other things
besides tobacco which ever get mixed with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and smoked?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so tobacco is big, big, big in
India.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there is no hash smoking or even
weed smoking in India without tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I mean, everybody smokes tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a matter of who or where.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could go to Himachal Pradesh,
you could go to Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure, the brand of the cigarette is
going to change or the brand of the
[SPEAKER_03]: tobacco is going to change, but they all
want tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's the bread that we eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to spread the jelly on
basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, tobacco is a very integral part
of our smoking culture everywhere,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there are a few other things that
actually get mixed along with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And opium would be one of the things that
do because we have a lot of Ayurvedic
[SPEAKER_03]: opium preparations here in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to be sure not to confuse this
with heroin in any way, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: opium preparations as in like their
Ayurvedic, they're mixed with some spices
[SPEAKER_03]: and then it becomes a medicine actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really beneficial.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have those getting mixed a lot with,
you know, cannabis often, but then again,
[SPEAKER_03]: the tobacco has to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, without tobacco,
you just cannot imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, please, I cannot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so if I smoke without tobacco and
I've tried, you know, because sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: some people would give me that what do you
call that dab and it just feels
[SPEAKER_03]: incomplete, you know, if you're not
smoking with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand the underlying reason for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, part of that is that you
eventually get addicted to the,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, substances in tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, if we were just to talk about
the experience and the very typical Indian
[SPEAKER_03]: experience of smoking, then it's just
cannot be imagined without tobacco in any,
[SPEAKER_03]: any place, no matter where you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: In India.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's understandable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd certainly heard that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do people tend to smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they use chillums?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they use bongs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they use joints?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you say is the most common?
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually people begin with cigarettes and
then they empty cigarettes and then fill
[SPEAKER_03]: them back up, you know, with the mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then usually people graduate to
smoking in joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, they start buying, you know,
rolling paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as people, you know, tend to grow a
little more older.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, of course, not talking about
everyone, but I'm just going to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: the typical smoker, you know, middle
class, like a working class kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: society that works in the ITU's and are
related to software related jobs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those people then after a while,
they tend to lean more to gravitate more
[SPEAKER_03]: towards bong smoking because it's just
more convenient and it's not that time
[SPEAKER_03]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you could just smoke,
get a good high and get on with your
[SPEAKER_03]: curriculum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that contributes a lot in
people, you know, gravitating more towards
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking in bongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: The chillum is more like a, it's more like
a pseudo connoisseur environment in India
[SPEAKER_03]: related to chillum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while you have a lot of people,
you know, who smoke a chillum and they
[SPEAKER_03]: have very expensive chillums as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But more than often, and I'm not talking
about everyone, of course, more than often
[SPEAKER_03]: I see people, they are using a smoking a
chillum only because they would want the
[SPEAKER_03]: other person to see that they're smoking
in chillum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that, that is supposed to,
you know, give you a high ground in their
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, amongst other smokers,
I don't necessarily feel that way,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I can certainly see that, you know,
you know, in people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while, I mean, you know, chillum
smoking is morally culturally confined
[SPEAKER_03]: within the babas, but the new generation
that smokes in chillum, I think they smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: out of chillum more, that has to do more
with either, you know, either trying to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, experience what babas experience
in a way, you know, or just to be in a
[SPEAKER_03]: place where you have a, you know,
moral high ground or just a high ground
[SPEAKER_03]: over everyone that you smoke in chillum
and other people smoking bong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird, but that's how it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is a thing in India,
basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have like an Italian chillum,
you know, that costs like $200 and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking in it, so you automatically become
a connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you may not know anything about
cannabis, but if you have a chillum,
[SPEAKER_03]: then whoa, man, yeah, look out for this
guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, if I'm just smoking a
joint, then, you know, I'm, I'm,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you're just like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So immediately, chillum will give you a
status hike amongst the smokers in the
[SPEAKER_03]: circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: But does it, does it have an intrinsic,
you know, property to it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I mean, I'm not really able to see
that to an extent that I can explain it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't much prefer to smoke in
chillum a lot, but when I go to Himachal
[SPEAKER_03]: Pradesh, they have some absolutely lovely
chillums.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I indulge in that fully till my throat
is, you know, a sacrifice, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess just as a really quick
followup, is there that same kind of hype
[SPEAKER_02]: culture, maybe more particularly in the
younger people, like what we see in
[SPEAKER_02]: America where like, you know, they want to
try to use it as a status thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, you know, I'm smoking
cookies in my chillum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how cool I am.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, but there, uh, but in a much
different way, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way this works in India would be maybe
that if you go to Malana, like I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: if I go to Malana and I'm always,
like, you know, trying to smoke in
[SPEAKER_03]: different chillums and I'm not really
trying to find a joint or just bong,
[SPEAKER_03]: just forget about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why, why, why that happens is because
when, when you're at a place, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, where it's a common practice,
then then as a human nature, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we, we want to gel in, we want to fit in
and we, we don't want to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: going around the village, holding a bong
and, you know, look different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people certainly like to do that,
but most people would like to gel in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, it has that aspect to it,
uh, the, the chillum smoking and the high
[SPEAKER_03]: ground really, uh, or, or the superiority
that, uh, that is imparted by owning a
[SPEAKER_03]: chillum or smoking in a chillum really
comes from one that it costs a lot if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: an original Italian chillum and everybody
knows that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And second is that it is, it is almost as
if assumed or, you know, presumed that if
[SPEAKER_03]: you have a very nice chillum, then you
must have a very nice hash too,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is not necessarily correct again,
because you know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, those are just really the
things, uh, you know, why people tend to
[SPEAKER_03]: have chillums because of course you go in
circle, there are girls as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, you want to, you want to
look good, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to make sure that girls are like
totally stoked on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, there are just so many
reasons, but I just don't see it for the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultural reasons so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So among the youngsters, with that said,
there are certainly some youngsters who
[SPEAKER_03]: are, you know, very dedicated and they
would follow all the rituals, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: pass it to the right and, you know,
pray before, you know, smoking it,
[SPEAKER_03]: they take care of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I absolutely love to be with those
people sometime and smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as you move out of those circles,
I mean, most of the people you see are
[SPEAKER_03]: just the rich people, you know,
who can afford to spend a lot of money and
[SPEAKER_03]: get hold of these things, but they don't,
uh, actually appreciate them in a way
[SPEAKER_03]: that, uh, you know, a Baba would do or,
or another youngster is doing who is
[SPEAKER_03]: following all the rituals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess understand all there's a
natural kind of distribution there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the other things I noticed on
your Instagram that I wanted to follow up
[SPEAKER_02]: on, which seems like it's kind of more of
a local thing is that you posted a photo
[SPEAKER_02]: of what you said was a traditional
Kashmiri corn wrapped and baked hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please tell me a little bit more about
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never even heard of that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a really special one in 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, let's talk about,
I mean, how that came to be, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: like how we were able to document it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in 2018, I invited my friend from USA
to come and, you know, let's go to Kashmir
[SPEAKER_03]: and see if we can come back alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we went there and once we were there,
um, the guy that was supposed to take us
[SPEAKER_03]: around and my friend, our ex-servant,
they said, you know, what we can actually
[SPEAKER_03]: arrange because we have material we can
arrange for making hash right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want, you have mobile phones,
you could like, you know, capture it and
[SPEAKER_03]: then it could be made into documentaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I was in college, because,
uh, you know, along with psychology,
[SPEAKER_03]: I also was part of, you know, mass,
you know, mass communication team.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know a little bit of editing and
softwares like, you know, final cut pro
[SPEAKER_03]: and Sony Vegas pro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought, yeah, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could just take that footage and I could
make it into a small, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: documentary or a short film kind of thing
and show it to other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, um, I mean, showing is always,
you know, better than telling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we covered that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I myself didn't really know
a lot about it, even though, because I
[SPEAKER_03]: live in, I live near Kashmir, you know,
so we often get, uh, get that here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we get that kind of hash here,
but we never tried to really, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, reconcile what this is and why
would this hash be like this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's so many other
things that could be thought of.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I was in college, when I was
there, it was happening in front of me and
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to see the entire process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was even like asking them the things
that I could not, you know, readily
[SPEAKER_03]: understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what this process is, it's very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mix of, you know, a few cultural
phenomenon, a few techniques, which are
[SPEAKER_03]: apparently not from Kashmir has been
brought, you know, from other countries
[SPEAKER_03]: like Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have a few things happening,
which are really, really local to that
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how people usually go about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is happening mostly in Srinagar in
the Southern Kashmir region.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Northern Kashmir, they're not doing it
so much because it's really wet out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Southern Kashmir, what they do is they
don't have a farm population of cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would just go during the season
and as soon as they find a good plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: they break it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They break it and they leave it there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They break it, they leave it there and
they mark the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They remember where I broke the plants and
I have to go back to those places.
[SPEAKER_03]: After a few days, or a few weeks,
they would go back with a big polythene
[SPEAKER_03]: and they would, you know, then collect all
of the materials that's on those plants
[SPEAKER_03]: and just bring it back to a place where
they're going to, you know, go about the
[SPEAKER_03]: rest of the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first thing that is done is they
just spread it out in the sun,
[SPEAKER_03]: let it dry, let the material dry
completely in case there's some water,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, or some moisture in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once it's completely dried, they just
simply go about how people usually or
[SPEAKER_03]: traditionally tries if they take a cloth
and tie it over a plastic sort of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do you call it, plastic sort of tub.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they just, you know, sieve the
dry material over that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: pile after pile and the resin is collected
in the tub.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that process is pretty much,
I mean, similar to what you see in places
[SPEAKER_03]: like Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm pretty sure this process has come
from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the interesting part and the part that
is not seen or heard anywhere else is what
[SPEAKER_03]: happens after that, I mean, they don't
actually stop there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they usually do is they take that
dry sieved resin and they will make it
[SPEAKER_03]: into a ball.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they would of course just press it
into a, you know, ball-like thing inside a
[SPEAKER_03]: plastic and they would let it sit and,
you know, cure a little bit so that those
[SPEAKER_03]: lipids and, you know, cannabinoids can be,
you know, separated and it would be easy
[SPEAKER_03]: for it to, you know, process it later.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not that they're thinking in those
ways, but it's usually what happens when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're curing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now after a few months, if you're doing it
properly, then you would do it after a few
[SPEAKER_03]: months.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're like, you know, a youngster from
Srinagar who is just trying to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, make some hash, they usually do
it the same day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on that particular day, they did it the
same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took the hash and you need corn
wraps, you know, the corn husk and they
[SPEAKER_03]: need to be dried and they need to be
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before you're going to put resin inside
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they do is they take the dry sieve
resin and they completely, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: smuff them, just fill them up and tie it
very tightly, you know, bound it in a way,
[SPEAKER_03]: wound it with a thread.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they would put a cloth over it,
which is a little wet or rather wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they would bound it again with,
you know, some kind of thread and they
[SPEAKER_03]: would light a fire and they are thrown
into the fire, like directly into the
[SPEAKER_03]: fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this fire is not being controlled.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have no idea what temperature it is
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have no idea what temperature your
hash is going to go up and down to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just all a matter of experience
from that point onwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, once you throw that, you know,
little thingy into the fire, then you just
[SPEAKER_03]: have to know when to take it out and just
beat it into a snake-like shape,
[SPEAKER_03]: which they do later on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're late, then it'll be all
burned.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do it early, then it's just
going to be a really messed up thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is not, you know, properly
homogenized.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you do it just right and you let
everything just go to a liquefied form,
[SPEAKER_03]: but at the same time, you bring it out and
not let those cannabinoids and terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: degrade to a level that it won't even make
you high, then you can do a perfect job
[SPEAKER_03]: because once it cools down, it comes out
of the fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is perfectly homogenized because you
break it open and you look at the layers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that tells the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, pretty much that how well it's
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a very unique process.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I really felt, I mean,
because somebody asked me a question that
[SPEAKER_03]: why would they do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would make them do such a thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why could they just not cure it like they
would do in Pakistan or Afghanistan where
[SPEAKER_03]: they just like, you know, pack it and
store it and, you know, leave it for
[SPEAKER_03]: months on end?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is a good answer for that
because, you know, you are in Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is not Pakistan or
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And things and culture has been so much
different and, you know, smoking hash has
[SPEAKER_03]: not seen something, you know, particularly
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these people have a pressure to not
only harvest these plants, but at the same
[SPEAKER_03]: time, process them and process them fast
in a way or get it to a form where it does
[SPEAKER_03]: not smell a lot, but it still gets you
high and it's ready to go from the day one
[SPEAKER_03]: you make it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think because the decarboxylation
process is happening, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: while you're heating it and you're just
speeding up, you know, that curing
[SPEAKER_03]: process, although it's very rough and you
shouldn't be doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because you're just going to end
up, you know, burning a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids and especially terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the only way these people know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they do it actually well,
it comes out beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like nothing else that you've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a matter of fact, when I met Bodhi
in Allahabad, you know, in 2019,
[SPEAKER_03]: January, I was able to bring some of the
hash from Kashmir, which was in the powder
[SPEAKER_03]: form and some hash, which was then made
into this, you know, this Kornhurst hash,
[SPEAKER_03]: baked hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I also got some, which my friend,
you know, our cake serpent had pressed in
[SPEAKER_03]: the modern ways with some heat and,
you know, pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I mean, it's a good question you
asked, but we don't really understand I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean, what drives the whole thing,
why they do it this way and not any other
[SPEAKER_03]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there certainly seems to be a cultural
pressure and the way things have been
[SPEAKER_03]: evolving in that place, that they have an
urgency to process everything quickly and
[SPEAKER_03]: just get it to a condensed state,
which is easy to hide and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course, makes sense, you know,
different historical situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to do things a bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of in that same vein of history,
historical things, I noticed in one of
[SPEAKER_02]: your posts, you were talking about how
sugarcane and cannabis have a very
[SPEAKER_02]: intertwined history.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you go on to talk about how it was
kind of transported by a lot of slaves
[SPEAKER_02]: that were a part of the European
colonialist kind of settlements.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you be able to just talk a little
bit about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really interesting point,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I mean, if you look at all the
varieties which are going in West Indies,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when I say West Indies,
so let me just make this clear,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm speaking of Caribbean islands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in India, we usually do not say
Caribbean or Caribbean islands.
[SPEAKER_03]: We refer to them as West Indies or West
Indies islands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you look at the West Indies
islands, and you know, and I'm just going
[SPEAKER_03]: to speak about those places, there are so
many other places that could also share
[SPEAKER_03]: the same history, but we're just not sure
of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm only going to speak about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis varieties which are growing
there, and I'm not aware of the many which
[SPEAKER_03]: are, they seem to be, you know,
a product of, you know, history,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what happened in history,
because when we had, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the colonial rule from, you know,
the Britishers, so of course, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they had just figured out that,
hey, you know what, the sugar that is so
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive back in Europe, and it's almost
like a luxury, like every goddamn person
[SPEAKER_03]: is eating here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the guy who doesn't have anything
on him can still have some sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they thought, you know, what they need
to do is they need to produce it a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: more so that they could make it
abundantly, you know, available in their
[SPEAKER_03]: country, in their region as well,
so everyone can enjoy it, and rightly so.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they started, I mean, of course,
doing the surveys, and they understood
[SPEAKER_03]: this is a crop that would grow in tropical
regions or subtropical regions,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they started looking for those places,
and it just so happens at the same time
[SPEAKER_03]: they, I mean, they had colonies at the
West Indian islands, and they thought,
[SPEAKER_03]: wow, this is a perfect place, and these
are islands, you know, we could just bring
[SPEAKER_03]: slave from, you know, these places and put
them here and make them grow sugar cane,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, just, yeah, I mean,
things really went in history,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they did was they got some people
from Africa and some people from India,
[SPEAKER_03]: which both were their colonies at that
point in time, and, you know, they put
[SPEAKER_03]: them there in West Indian island and said,
hey, you know what, go ahead and just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, do our thing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The farms, they already had the farm set
up, and they started working there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just imagine this, these people are
being taken on the ship, so it was only,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it only made sense to these
people that, you know, we're not coming
[SPEAKER_03]: back, so we have to take everything with
us that, you know, we like to do on a
[SPEAKER_03]: daily basis, and cannabis seems to be one
of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a fact, because we know that,
because if you go back into the,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the British Commission report
that they did on hemp and drugs,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the name exactly,
but there's a report that was published by
[SPEAKER_03]: the Britishers about the India and about
the use of cannabis in India and the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultural effects and the physical effects
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that tells us that, you know,
even before that, there was a widespread
[SPEAKER_03]: use of cannabis in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that these people took these
seeds along with them to the West Indian
[SPEAKER_03]: islands, and they started growing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, those seeds, I mean,
those varieties readily acclimatized to
[SPEAKER_03]: those regions, because why the whole
region they were brought to West Indian
[SPEAKER_03]: islands was because the temperature and
the climate was pretty similar to that of
[SPEAKER_03]: where they were living in South India.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of these, you know, slaves were
taken from Southern India and very rarely
[SPEAKER_03]: from Northern India.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the cannabis varieties that they
brought with them just readily took off,
[SPEAKER_03]: and over time, I'm sure they must have
adapted in a few different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been there, so I don't know
what they look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or any idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so that's the connection between
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, even you could just see the
same thing happening in the people as
[SPEAKER_03]: well, because they got people from Africa
and India.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had people in Africa, you know,
who were like turned into Christians
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier when they were in Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you had Indians who were just
Hindus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you have people in West Indies
right now who have a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_03]: they have very weird names, which are half
English and half Hindi, like Shiv Narayan
[SPEAKER_03]: Chandra Paul.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a ball in their name.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Shiva.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Chandra and or they're just so
many examples, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just see the culture of
amalgamation and, you know, the way
[SPEAKER_03]: history played out in people and in their
names and in their languages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the plant that they grow
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, they had the sugarcane and
cannabis go back a very, very long time,
[SPEAKER_03]: in fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you think that this is kind of a
bit of a two-parter, but do you think that
[SPEAKER_02]: given many people consider some of these
islands to have their own kind of native
[SPEAKER_02]: land race, do you think that that's proof
that it only takes, you know, a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred years for a land race to readjust
and become a whole new land race?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because land race is a very broad
term again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it could cover it could basically
cover a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you go just by the word definition,
it says that any domestic, any
[SPEAKER_03]: traditionally domesticated variety at a
certain, you know, geographical locale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, there are plants
which were not domesticated, which were
[SPEAKER_03]: there even before we were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that for a fact, the plants
have been before us, like way before us
[SPEAKER_03]: when we came here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do we account for those varieties?
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are the primordial land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, if you if you're saying about if
you're talking about the regional land
[SPEAKER_03]: race varieties, which which I think would
be a more appropriate term to use here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that happens in as in as small of a
time as 200 to 100 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see these plant varieties evolve
and just become completely different
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties because of the selective
environmental pressure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, human beings are just all
around this plant all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really have to track all the
activity and understand their culture for
[SPEAKER_03]: you to really, you know, paint a picture
that what could have happened with this
[SPEAKER_03]: plant for it to become like this today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you understand their culture and
you understand the environment and the
[SPEAKER_03]: history, I mean, you can just paint a very
comprehensive picture that how things came
[SPEAKER_03]: to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that just that might just also give
you a theme or an insight into,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, how a cannabis plant basically
adapts to different terroirs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just need a lot more data and a lot
more studying from a lot more people.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, this is not something that
cannot be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, this is a bit of a weird idea
I've had, but I'd love to hear your
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughts on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, I'm wondering if you've
ever noticed that in areas where
[SPEAKER_02]: historically cannabis was grown with other
crops, like maybe say maize or sugarcane,
[SPEAKER_02]: like they were kind of grown in the same
general area, maybe even the same field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever noticed that maybe those
plants have increased IPM?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because what I kind of wonder is like,
were these two crops, be it corn,
[SPEAKER_02]: maize and cannabis, were they ever grown
side by side because maybe they benefited
[SPEAKER_02]: each other in an IPM sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or have you never really seen much like
that?
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the IPM is concerned,
I think it's it might be the other way
[SPEAKER_03]: around, because even if you look at the
plants which are of the same family,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the cannabis family, you look at
stinging nettle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, nettles are of the same family as
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you do see that those both of those
plants are, you know, getting affected by
[SPEAKER_03]: a similar pest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but but that really I mean,
but that's not a thing like because
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis plant was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why the pest must have gotten onto
the nettle plant or because the nettle
[SPEAKER_03]: plant was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They made it the vector to ultimately
reach, you know, the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the way it really works for a
lot of other crops that grows along with
[SPEAKER_03]: it, like maize and, you know, you could
say wheat or even potatoes that they may
[SPEAKER_03]: have certain benefit in terms of like,
you know, fixing nitrogen or something of
[SPEAKER_03]: that sort.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as IPM is concerned,
they do not because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, as we know, is one of the plants
that produces aromatic compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the plants that we're talking
about are like potato maize and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just do not produce aromatic
compounds like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just do not have the kind of,
you know, protection against the pests
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, other insects as cannabis
as a plant has.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe cannabis provides them security
from the pest.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never looked into that, never thought
of it, but definitely a great thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to make a note of it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, next this year when I go
out, I will try to look for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will try to look for some conclusive
data that could, you know, show clearly
[SPEAKER_03]: what's happening, whether, you know,
cannabis is helping the other plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, not get a lot of pests or
actually they're using it as a vector to
[SPEAKER_03]: get onto the other plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll try to collect data and definitely
get back to you this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now let's move on to some viewers from our
questions that we had submitted just a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of hours ago and we got some good
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the first one, I think it's going
to be a little hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first question is, do you think
there'll be a time in the near future
[SPEAKER_02]: where Americans will be able to travel
through the farms of Pakistan and
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't really understand that
question, basically, because people are
[SPEAKER_03]: doing right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only a matter of finances and it's
only a matter of courage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, see, nobody's going to stop an
American from getting a visa for Pakistan
[SPEAKER_03]: or Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if anything, it's the other way
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to get an American or a European
or Australian visa for people who are in
[SPEAKER_03]: Asian countries, especially India,
Pakistan, Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's only a matter of courage
and resources, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go there and you can roam around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've certainly seen a couple of
French guys, you know, who are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took some pictures, got some seed for
some of the Europeans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seed banks recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but if you're maybe referring to it in
a way that when things would legalize,
[SPEAKER_03]: then I'm not sure if things are going to
legalize very, very soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't know what's going to happen
in future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all we can do is just stay hopeful
that it does happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, everybody could be out in
the open and, you know, flaunt their feet
[SPEAKER_03]: on the Instagram without having to fear
about, you know, getting objected or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, taken into custody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next question is, have you ever
found any land races that kind of have a
[SPEAKER_02]: strawberry smell to them and specifically
any Pakistanis with the strawberry smell?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have smelled a few plants in highland
regions, which is around Uttarakhand and
[SPEAKER_03]: Himachal Pradesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a distinct smell of strawberry,
but they were just one odd plant which
[SPEAKER_03]: were growing in a very variable
population.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I didn't really think of,
you know, getting those seeds and didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really think that it's going to help me,
you know, get to that terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you talk about Pakistani,
I'm going to say no, because most of that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff is like really acrid and,
you know, spicy and like toluene-like
[SPEAKER_03]: smell, like phenol-like smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys use, do you guys use like a
disinfectant?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Dital.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has that phenol.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it has that phenol smell in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get that a lot and toluene smell
that comes from the whitener, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the correction whitener.
[SPEAKER_03]: People even, you know, use it to get high
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those, those smells are pretty,
you know, pretty often found in Pakistani
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think there was one Balochistani
variety, which came from our Balochistani
[SPEAKER_03]: friend that he claims has apples and
strawberry-like smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I haven't started growing them yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to go ahead and say if
yes or no, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have complete faith because we're
not talking about a cross-pollinated,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, population here.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the plants which have been,
you know, selectively inbred by the family
[SPEAKER_03]: itself, and they keep it within the
family.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, if he's specifically pointing
towards, you know, strawberry and apple,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they seem to have a very good
understanding towards the flavors because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're eating so many different fruits
over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I'll trust him and we'll see
if, you know, it does come out exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: like strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that would be amazing because I've
never had anything that is like even close
[SPEAKER_03]: to the strawberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of, I wanted to ask,
in fact, I wanted to ask you a question
[SPEAKER_03]: and I asked that question to everyone that
I speak of from, you know, from the
[SPEAKER_03]: Western society that it's the smells that
people talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, often people talking about like
smells like banana and people are talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about smell like rubber.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've never smelled those things on
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, never smelled a plant that was
exactly like a banana or like exactly like
[SPEAKER_03]: rubber.
[SPEAKER_03]: So could you maybe tell me, I'm sorry,
but I'm just curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know, I mean, are there plants
that really actually smell straight up
[SPEAKER_03]: like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of the banana one,
I've smelled the popular clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: Banana ROG and stuff like that in the
States.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like a candy banana,
not like a real banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can understand why you would say I've
never smelled anything like banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think the reality is no one's
really smelled anything that smells like
[SPEAKER_02]: an actual banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people have smelled things that smells
like a candy banana, which is just
[SPEAKER_02]: probably like two or three of the main
terpenes that come out of a banana,
[SPEAKER_02]: but obviously not a full spectrum picture
of what it actually is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in terms of the rubber one,
I hear people say that all the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I myself have never smelled anything
that smells like rubber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe it's just a general term
people use to describe a more acrid,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe kind of yeah, like offensive smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I would agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're going to be very strict about it,
I've never smelled anything that smells
[SPEAKER_02]: like a real banana or like real burnt
rubber.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was really curious about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a word with, again, I don't know his
name and I'm really bad at with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't ask people's name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pipsweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You must know him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He must be a friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Pipsweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's amazing guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been speaking to him for,
you know, some time now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I was really interested
because he had this variety that's called
[SPEAKER_03]: rubber city.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just, you know, asked him,
does that really actually smells like
[SPEAKER_03]: rubber?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think what he said was really
interesting because I think he said pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: much similar to what you said that,
well, it's not exactly you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: closing your eyes and, you know,
that you would be able to imagine rubber
[SPEAKER_03]: like smell, but it's more like an oniony
offensive smell that could, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: at times be, you know, felt like it is
coming off as a burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I had to get a pack from him
and, you know, I'm just going to grow and
[SPEAKER_03]: see, you know, what exactly it's like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really want to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's, that's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I got a little follow up question
for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any issues getting seeds in
from like America or the EU?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like getting seeds from America to
India.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if people send you stuff,
do you ever really have any issues with it
[SPEAKER_02]: or it usually always makes it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no issues at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, India is very, very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, especially if it's coming from
America or Europe, Australia, New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, these great countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we just don't really bother about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm getting seeds from Pakistan,
Afghanistan, you know, that's when we
[SPEAKER_03]: really tend to have issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the next question I think is a
really good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the person says, what is one of the
land races that you've experienced?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we should say regional cultivars,
if we're going to be correct, that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: found that you would recommend for like
kind of a home grower who's just looking
[SPEAKER_02]: to start out with a land race.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want any, it's going to get too
unruly or really out of control,
[SPEAKER_02]: like just to help them get their feet wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an amazing question because I think
about it all the time, because I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: as much as I want to, you know,
motivate other people and talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: preservation, the ground reality is that
people have responsibilities and people
[SPEAKER_03]: have to feed their families and they have
to, you know, manage their space and do
[SPEAKER_03]: other work as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what life is all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in order to strike balance,
there has to be some varieties,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, who would let you preserve a
land race variety or an heirloom variety
[SPEAKER_03]: or like a regional variety, but at the
same time, it will not bother you a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: that it would interfere with, you know,
your work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just, for an example, let's say you
only have one tent, which is four by four
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're going some OG Kush in there and
you have Kerala Gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to grow really wide and tall
and eventually you would be forced to lift
[SPEAKER_03]: your lights up, but your OG Kush may not
grow that tall and then it would have to
[SPEAKER_03]: be, you know, lifted up or you would have
to do some kind of makeshift arrangements.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it will be a constant improvising,
you know, which is not really a big
[SPEAKER_03]: problem though, but everybody's not,
does not have the kind of schedule to be
[SPEAKER_03]: in their, you know, grow room all the time
and do these adjustments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think as we discussed earlier,
the Pakistani varieties are perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they bring, you know, both,
the best of the both were, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: those narrow slim leaf and, you know,
the broad leaf varieties in a way that is
[SPEAKER_03]: just unparalleled and again, the variety
and the variation is still there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody has selected it for anything
specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can pretty much, you know,
turn your magic on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Swabi would be one of those thing,
one of those varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it has an amazing high,
amazing high for a variety, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that people have not heard of so much and
it's very easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's not going to get,
you know, all unruly and it's not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: become like a swamp monster inside your
tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll be able to control it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think just, you know, keep an eye out
for that Swabi lines that's going to come
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to, Mass Medical is going to,
you know, release them pure in the long
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering and the short flowering version.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure he'll be working on some
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like his thing, but yeah,
those would be really good options to
[SPEAKER_03]: bounce onto if people just want to get
into and not really get into very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very deep waters straight away.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, this is a great way to get a
taste of it and not get into trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next question we have from our
viewer is how do you know Babakoh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very interesting story because
initially I met him over the Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I came across his account and,
but I never really did send him any
[SPEAKER_03]: message because that's usually how we were
not working.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we were, we had like stop sending
messages to random people and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, getting random seeds from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were kind of like traveling out to
places more working more like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at the same time I had a, you know,
I had a friend in Delhi, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: who's basically a South Indian,
but he was in Delhi at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was also following him somehow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the connection was
basically, but Baba, he came to India
[SPEAKER_03]: because you know, I'm not going to go into
the details of his affair because he was
[SPEAKER_03]: there for some kind of hospital related
thing, you know, that they have to come
[SPEAKER_03]: because they don't have that kind of
services in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, India just seemed to have a
little better when it comes to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, medical services, doctors and
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was here for that and, you know,
he wanted to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he basically called, you know,
the guys, you know, who live in Delhi guys
[SPEAKER_03]: who were usually doing the banana stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they offered to give him
some hash, but I think because it was very
[SPEAKER_03]: costly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, he was not sure whether or
not he was going to get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then subsequently he contacted me and
he told me, you know, Hey, you know what,
[SPEAKER_03]: this guy's from Afghanistan and he's in
Delhi.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, this would be a great
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys can connect and see, you know,
if you guys can get some kind of trade
[SPEAKER_03]: going for seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me the phone number.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gave me the phone number.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent him a WhatsApp message and I was
like, Hey, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I follow you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen some pictures, you know,
cannabis, you're from Afghanistan and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I told him, Hey, you know what,
like you're welcome to India and I would
[SPEAKER_03]: like to make sure you're taken care of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just call my friends in Delhi and,
you know, told them to get some hash to
[SPEAKER_03]: him ASAP free of cost, of course,
and make sure he's taken care of.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he said, I'm going to
remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went back and he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he said, okay, you know,
if you want seed, I could send you seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I told him that, you know,
this is what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually take seeds from indigenous
communities or farmers directly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we, you know, give them out to
other people who need them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need it in the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they kind of pay for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that money could be
distributed amongst, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: people who are collecting it and people,
you know, who are connected to the
[SPEAKER_03]: operation in many different ways as they
deserve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now he was, he was really game for that
because, you know, of course, everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: would need some financial help at the end
of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I, I set up, you know,
I spoke to these people at full power
[SPEAKER_03]: selection and told them, basically,
you know, we're going to do this and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to do a pre-order and seeds were on
its way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And next thing you know, the seeds get
busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So seeds didn't make it to India.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is around, this is happening like
a beginning of April, 2018.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got really nervous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I have to get these seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, you know, Baba told me that,
Hey man, I'm game for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I will do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just tell me what I have to do and I
will get this thing to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I absolutely have no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the way government, you know,
works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we, you know, realize at that
point in time, the only way around it was
[SPEAKER_03]: to actually get the guy, you know,
actually fly the guy over to India and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, ask him to simply just get the
seeds because they're not going to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, take it out on the airport
because basically to possess seeds is
[SPEAKER_03]: legal in India because of the,
you know, religious, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: things attached to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's exactly what he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: He flew along with so many different
varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we picked him, we picked
them up and came to Delhi and from Delhi,
[SPEAKER_03]: we got him to, you know, our headquarters
just somewhere near, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Punjab, Shivalik.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we sat, we spoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to understand the culture as much
as I could because, you know, language is
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit of problem, not much of a
problem because he does understand Hindi,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, which is our language.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but I don't seem to really
understand, you know, the Arabic language
[SPEAKER_03]: or the Farsi language that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he speaks English, you know,
as well, not as much, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: as much as you could, he could make you
understand what he's trying to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We sat there for about week and,
you know, we went out to a few places,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, roamed around Punjab,
had a good time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave me the seeds and then,
you know, we sent him back with all due
[SPEAKER_03]: respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's where we really
started to work with those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I did get to, you know,
send him like a couple more times.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a few different varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went ahead and documented those
varieties for him, you know, so that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that information of,
so not just seeds, but information could
[SPEAKER_03]: also become, you know, available to people
so that when they're growing it and if
[SPEAKER_03]: they see something peculiar, they can fall
back to that cultural, historical,
[SPEAKER_03]: geographical data and see if that has any
relevance to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's basically how the findings
are made.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that went on for about a year,
but then, you know, of course we are a
[SPEAKER_03]: small collective and you got to
understand, I mean, you know, full power
[SPEAKER_03]: selection, even they're just like a couple
of my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can send out like a lot of orders.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to, we can only do a limited
amount of work, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, he had a massive amount of seeds
and, you know, he had so much more coming
[SPEAKER_03]: in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it was only the best that,
you know, he got in contact with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, bigger seed banks who have the
ability to take more orders and the
[SPEAKER_03]: ability to, you know, send out more orders
readily.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's exactly what he's
doing, which is fabulous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really happy, you know,
that he's been able to do so much for
[SPEAKER_03]: himself and, you know, all the credit is
to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like, you know, it's all been him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He collected those varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: He understood they need to preserve.
[SPEAKER_03]: He took immense amount of risk getting
those varieties out to these different
[SPEAKER_03]: places.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I have a great amount of
respect for him and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: he has really been a central figure in
this whole movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I was pretty lucky to have met
him at a certain point in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great little recount on that
introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next question we had was,
what's the single most surprising smell
[SPEAKER_02]: you've come across from a regional
cultivar?
[SPEAKER_03]: The single most, you know, weird,
or I would say weird smell was there was
[SPEAKER_03]: this one plant that was growing in Beiling
Valley and it has a smell which is
[SPEAKER_03]: straight like ammonia, like hydrogen,
you know, should I say.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in India, they use a cheap,
you know, derivative that is used to color
[SPEAKER_03]: the hair, you know, to bleach your hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically hydrogen, I think,
if I'm not wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has that astringent ammonia-like
smell to it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the same smell that comes
from urine as well because there's ammonia
[SPEAKER_03]: in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could smell exactly the straight
ammonia smell from a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a really ugly plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took a picture of that and I made a post
about that and back in 2017, if you go
[SPEAKER_03]: down my feed, you can actually find that
post from 2017.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can also look at the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not look at all like any of the
plants which were growing there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the smell was something,
I mean, it was just awful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, awful in a very good way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was straight ammonia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like you found like the,
the regional cultivar equivalent of the
[SPEAKER_02]: roadkill skunk, but there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to look more for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next question we had was,
do you have any tips or tricks for people
[SPEAKER_02]: who are trying to grow high-altitude
cultivars at sea level?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really think, I mean, given that,
you know, cannabis as adaptive,
[SPEAKER_03]: as adaptive as a plant that it is,
and rightly so, it's called the weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, for that reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never, what I've experienced from my
growing, and I don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: experience, but this is what I'm going to
tell you from my experience, whatever I
[SPEAKER_03]: have, that cannabis does not require like
very special things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to make it so hard on you
and, you know, you grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you keep it simple, I pretty much
believe every plant does pretty much good
[SPEAKER_03]: as long as you're growing it in a 22
degrees to a 26, 27 degrees Celsius range,
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature range, and, you know,
relative humidities somewhere around like
[SPEAKER_03]: 50, 55, 60, and, you know, you have a
decent soil medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't really have to, you know,
worry about things at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the other hand, if you are growing
an equatorial variety and you happen to be
[SPEAKER_03]: living in a place which happens to be
higher up in the latitude, that means you
[SPEAKER_03]: can have a shorter season for flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you have to, you know,
then you have to ensure that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: either you're working with a variety
that's not going to flower, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: past November, or you just have to grow it
indoors and, you know, put it into
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering straight away instead of giving
it veg time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because even if you grow those equatorials
or highland narrow leaf varieties,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, straight away under 12 to 12,
which is basically what induces the
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering in them, they still go on to
grow pretty much like four or five,
[SPEAKER_03]: six feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you veg them, then I mean,
it's really going to be a problem if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not expecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just get out of hand all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the final question from our viewers
that they've submitted is, have you ever
[SPEAKER_02]: made your way over towards kind of
Thailand and down that way?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been to Burma.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have to, you know, you can
actually go to Burma, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: without a visa and without a passport.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been to Burma, but I'm planning to
go down Thailand this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I have a great friend
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a beautiful collective,
you know, they're preserving Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, other land races from,
you know, different regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really want to go there and meet
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have friends in Laos as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have friends in Cambodia as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm really meaning to meet
them because I did get seeds from them
[SPEAKER_03]: last year and I was able to help them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to, you know, give back to them
and they were really happy, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that I told them something and I came
through and, you know, they kind of trust
[SPEAKER_03]: me with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to go and meet them in
person and, you know, establish a deeper
[SPEAKER_03]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: And try to collect some data as well
firsthand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now onto our last little quick fire
questions before we wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first one I had for you was,
in your opinion, what kind of little
[SPEAKER_02]: pocket or region of the world has really
fantastic cannabis, but just doesn't often
[SPEAKER_02]: get recognized for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cold desert regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which are basically in the trans-Himalayan
ranges.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think, I think they're completely
unheard of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody talks about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet they seem to have plants, you know,
which would rival most of the,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, modern varieties only in terms
of, you know, resin production,
[SPEAKER_03]: not in terms of high or the structure,
but in terms of the amount of resin that
[SPEAKER_03]: they can produce.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can pretty much be at par with some
of the, you know, modern varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're bang on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hadn't heard of those at all really.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next question is what's,
what's the one type of cannabis that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've always been looking for,
but you've never really found,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, is it like a certain smell or a
certain look?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what are you still chasing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty much not, I'm not trying to
chase like a specific flavor or a specific
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of plant or what I'm rather trying to
chase is as many places as I can,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so that I have a rather complete
picture of the evolution of this plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: or at least I can, you know, forward this
data to people who are competent enough or
[SPEAKER_03]: have the scientific abilities to put a
bigger picture together of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: how this plant evolved into these
different types.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because although we can, you know,
classify them and we can do all the
[SPEAKER_03]: labeling we want, but that doesn't really
tell us, you know, what actually happened,
[SPEAKER_03]: how they evolved into these different and
branched off into these different plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I'm really after is, you know,
if I can just somehow get, get to all of
[SPEAKER_03]: these places physically within this
lifetime and then, you know, concise that
[SPEAKER_03]: data in one, like a book kind of thing,
or, I mean, not necessarily, but in one
[SPEAKER_03]: place and then, you know, other people can
take that data and then they can,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, develop it further as we advance
and, you know, as more scientific people
[SPEAKER_03]: will be, you know, coming into the
industry because it's no longer a
[SPEAKER_03]: stigmatized industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we're seeing, you'll be seeing a
surge of, you know, scientists and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, engineers, and even,
you know, one of my friends is a software
[SPEAKER_03]: engineer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they want to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't feel like it's wrong anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the time when we are going to
really see a very steep curve of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the advancement and the
understanding of cannabis all across the
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, what is really going to be
off the prime importance here is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be that data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, if you don't have that,
if you don't really have the data and
[SPEAKER_03]: those things are gone, and it's going to
be really, really hard to really reconcile
[SPEAKER_03]: the complete picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very valid answer right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is your favorite cannabis that
you've ever had, be it flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: hash, what's the single one that stands
out the most in your memory is the best
[SPEAKER_02]: ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Best ever for me would have to be Lolab
Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the Lolab Valley is, I mean,
I don't have words and I'm not even going
[SPEAKER_03]: to attempt to explain it in words.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm just going to say this is the
best kind of effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm only speaking in terms of effects and
nothing else.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way it makes you feel, the place it
takes you as a person when you get high on
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like that place a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, other cannabis also takes
me to these different places and I like
[SPEAKER_03]: them, but, you know, Lolab Valley,
Northern Kashmiri varieties take me to a
[SPEAKER_03]: place that is just unparalleled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I just love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you, you just get some,
some seeds from me if you want and grow
[SPEAKER_03]: them and smoke them and you'll,
you'll know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, music to my ears, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to take you off on that,
but I want to give you a good little remix
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So often we hear people talk about,
oh, you know, I got to try this Landry's
[SPEAKER_02]: strain and it wasn't really that good or
something to that effect, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like standard Western person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the remix for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever tried a more modern strain,
maybe like a Cali import or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you were like a bit disappointed?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, but I think that was primarily
because it was not grown by me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was grown by someone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt that, you know, had it been
grown properly, I mean, it would have
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly lived up to the expectations
because see, like I said, in the beginning
[SPEAKER_03]: in India, I mean, hybrid wheat sells for
any, anywhere between 800 to $1,500 or
[SPEAKER_03]: $1,200 at least for an ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the biggest reason behind that is,
is the potency, I'm sorry, is the potency
[SPEAKER_03]: that you cannot find in the regional
varieties here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just cannot, I mean, the high is
unparalleled in the hybrid repertoire that
[SPEAKER_03]: you guys have over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very hard to be disappointed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I mean, I don't really understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, how can somebody be
disappointed?
[SPEAKER_03]: But then at the same time, I can
understand if all you have is all of this
[SPEAKER_03]: good wheat, then you tend to have a
relative scale, you know, which is mapped
[SPEAKER_03]: against some of the best varieties like
Cam Dog or OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then people tend to, or had been like
things that people tend to like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, compare everything to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the virtue of that comparison,
you know, some of the people who are
[SPEAKER_03]: regularly experiencing these things could
say that, you know, that this thing is not
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna get you that high or it's not that
enjoyable or this is crap if somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: chooses to talk that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, but for us, it's really hard to say
a hybrid sucks because I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're like smoking varieties mostly,
you know, which are not that potent,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's hard for somebody from
India to just smoke a hybrid and say that
[SPEAKER_03]: it is not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if it's coming from USA because
I see a lot of good work happening in USA
[SPEAKER_03]: and there are so many people doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I mean, I think the plant is in
very good hands in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hard to argue that they're not progressing
things forward in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So final question of the interview,
this brings us to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the one I wanted to ask you
the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could go anywhere and select seeds
from any area, any point in time in
[SPEAKER_02]: history, where would you go and what seeds
would you want to get?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could go back in history and I could
like, wow, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to think about it because I'd
never thought about it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just give me a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take as long as you need, my friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who would I want to go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I know what I would like to do is,
okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could only go to one place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I would like to go to that near that
cave at exactly the same point in time,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in Tibet, where they just found
this evidence for, you know, some
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, which was used by, you know,
some people some hundred thousand years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would want to be at that point in
time and get some of those, grab some of
[SPEAKER_03]: those seeds while those primitive
gentlemen are, you know, smoking on their
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and just take my time machine and
come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just get that primordial stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that just about brings us to the end
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have any comments or shout outs
you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, not, not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I think you were really able to,
I mean, just walk over all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you asked some things which I
hadn't even thought about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really I'm, I'm just all empty here,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, unless you have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, thank you so much for
joining us on the show, Irazing and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, dropping all the knowledge about
the land races and the local cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are going to really love
this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want to appreciate you from the
bottom of my heart because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let me tell you before we go,
I mean, 2017, I think was the year that I
[SPEAKER_03]: heard your podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the first time, man, you know,
so I've known about this thing for such a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it is an absolute privilege
to be here today and be able to speak to
[SPEAKER_03]: you and share my thoughts through your
reputed platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, the pleasure's all mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there we have it guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: A four hour block of pure information
download straight to your brain from your
[SPEAKER_02]: boy Irazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So appreciative.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much I didn't know about Indian stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you guys have learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like me, I hope you're excited to go
to India, do your own land race hunt now.
[SPEAKER_02]: As always, huge shout out to Coppit
Biological Systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best predator mites, microbial products
and artificial feeds in the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge shout out to CT now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guarantee unsatisfaction, not just
germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as always, big love to the Patreon
gang.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragonfly Earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you for the next one,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.
