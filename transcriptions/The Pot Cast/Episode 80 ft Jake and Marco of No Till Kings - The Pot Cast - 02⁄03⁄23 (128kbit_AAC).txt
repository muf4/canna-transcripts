we're joined by Jake and Marco from
[SPEAKER_02]: No-Till Kings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here to chat all things No-Till
cultivation, how the company's grown,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a little bit about some of their
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a quick one today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very grateful for the boys dropping
by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, they had a bit of an
emergency mid episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had to cut it short, but I'm sure
they'll be back for another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without further ado, let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty gang, here we are again for
another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today on this episode, we have the
legends behind the No-Till Kings,
[SPEAKER_02]: the organic fanatics and the humus beings
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jake and Marco from No-Till Kings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for having us on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to have you on as a as a
diehard organic fanatic myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a very knowledgeable
episode, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to start things off, what are you guys
smoking on today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new white widow that we're dropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been rolling up a lot of Gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the Gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a super gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a batch like a month and a
half, two months ago of some SFV times
[SPEAKER_01]: animal mints.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been smoking on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jake likes the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like more like the fruits and the
citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mimosa, our Jack, our white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all just, those are my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two different ends of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to say I'm with you,
Marco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm more of a fruity sort of guy myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I caught a lot of flack from the gas
heads for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jake's all about the gas, the cookies and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love gas too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, just the, the turps on,
on some of those fruitier strains are
[SPEAKER_00]: just, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, let's delve into that a little
more, but first quickly, I just want to
[SPEAKER_02]: ask you, Jake, given you like the SFV
animal mints, what's your favorite OG cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would say like what Josh D is
growing, like the OG Kush story,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Josh D cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the top OGs out there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, quite a few years ago,
like what Kushko was growing, the Kushko
[SPEAKER_01]: cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the OG cuts floating around LA
are similar, are like similar OG cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say like, like the Josh D cut
probably one of the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't, I haven't had some in a while,
but that's definitely one of the best OGs
[SPEAKER_01]: out there for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you guys run any pure OG out of
curiosity?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have, we don't have like a pure
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the SFV animal mint cross,
which is definitely a SFV dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we're looking, we're looking for
like that original cut and maybe it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: make its way over to us one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely, lovely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in amongst those initial strains we
mentioned, you guys mentioned the white
[SPEAKER_02]: widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot of fans messaging us,
requesting that we ask you about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: because as you guys would be aware,
you know, it's a blast from the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are super interested in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me a bit of the backstory,
you know, where'd the seeds come from,
[SPEAKER_02]: where'd the inspiration to Fino hunt this
classic come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's, we don't actually even really
remember where we got the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've, we've been trying to find a
white widow since we started growing that
[SPEAKER_00]: in Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you just, you pop seeds,
you can pop hundreds of seeds and none of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of Northern Lights in the
past and we haven't been able to put any
[SPEAKER_00]: out just because they haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, been, you know, the blood
structure hasn't been good or they haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked as good or that the smell just
isn't quite there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really stoked to have a white
widow come to market that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hits everything, the blood
structure, the turps, the look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's just very pungent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're super excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, I think people want to put their
stamp on new strains and cross things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually we want to do that too,
but there's just some sort of nostalgia
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, these old school strains
have, I think for a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, growing up smoking these
strains, they were so potent back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's definitely a need and want for
these old school strains to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: surface to the recreational market again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just kind of what we're focusing
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we're super excited to have the
white widow, white widow come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we Fino hunted a bunch of seeds and
the number of 11 was the, was the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: that we chose that made the cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also something too with, with these old
strains that are, that are somewhat making
[SPEAKER_01]: a comeback and we're bringing some back as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, a lot of people may remember a
white widow they've smoked 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 years ago, and ours may not be the same
as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not the same because we
hunted it from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas a lot of these old strain names
were clone only strains of a specific cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so white widow originally was bred
between two land race strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a Brazilian sativa crossed with an
Indian indica and our Fino that we found
[SPEAKER_01]: is definitely more on the sativa hybrid
leaning side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super fruity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got like a, like a candy chem nose
on, on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It like the flavors outrageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really excited for it to drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good disclaimer there,
Jake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think, um, yeah, with all these
old school strands, a lot of people will
[SPEAKER_00]: have, uh, you know, a certain phenotype in
mind, you know, like a certain clone that
[SPEAKER_00]: they had one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, there's so many other
phenos from the same lineage of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that, that was really good Jake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this huge sort of reminiscent rose
shade glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is thing when people look back and I
also find sometimes people maybe even try
[SPEAKER_02]: the exact clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are nostalgic over and they're like,
Oh, this actually isn't as good as I sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of remembered it, but that's a different
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to ask, um, out of the other
phenotypes, the ones that didn't quite
[SPEAKER_02]: make the cut, um, were they just sort of
more bland or did you find things that
[SPEAKER_02]: were maybe unique, but as you referenced,
like it didn't have the bag appeal or the
[SPEAKER_02]: structure or was it like, yeah,
how did it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of the times just,
you know, the bug gets really larpy or,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it's just, uh, not as dense,
um, as we'd like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then it's just also the nose just
isn't quite there that the, what we want
[SPEAKER_00]: it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we pride ourselves in having some of
the terpiest flower around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, if you're not opening the jar and
it's not slapping you in the face,
[SPEAKER_00]: then, then we don't want it in our jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: This sort of segues nicely into the next
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I noticed on your Instagram,
you guys do pheno hunt, um, various stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: and I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw the post about the pineapple
express where you sort of said,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, we're not sure if it's going
to sort of make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see how it smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It got me wondering how often is it that
you pheno hunt something and at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you may not have anything really to
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like pretty much out of a hundred seeds,
you may find one or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and if you find five or more than
five, that's like really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so if we, if we pop a batch of
seeds and there's like 10 or 15 from one
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, like it's, I mean, it's a roll of
the dice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really never know until you grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes we have to grow it a second
or third time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that second or third run
actually gives it a better chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so oftentimes it's not even after the
first round of testing that we even know
[SPEAKER_01]: if something is closer on the,
on the fence, we will run it a second
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, like most of the time it
doesn't work out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, uh, that's cool to hear that you
guys have like such a high standards for
[SPEAKER_02]: things to meet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we sort of move on,
I was just quickly curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any other sort of strains from
yesteryear that you guys are thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: about maybe delving into in the near
future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we are hunting some stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some green crack on the hunt,
um, as well as a couple of train wreck
[SPEAKER_01]: phenos, um, some ghost train haze,
ghost train haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a one or two Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we'll see what's up with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Northern lights, Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always wanting to get some Northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, I think, I think if we could
find a solid green crack too, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: another just super pungent strain that is
a blast from the past as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the first time I was smoking
green crack and it was just, it was
[SPEAKER_00]: something like I never tried before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds to me like you guys run a
reasonably balanced selection of sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: really new hype stuff, like maybe say
like, you know, the gelato or the cush
[SPEAKER_02]: mints, and then also some of this older
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how you view it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and was that intentional?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, especially on the, on the rec
market, you have to have flavors of all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's so challenging
nowadays, uh, in the recreational market,
[SPEAKER_00]: so many brands, so many marketing tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely have to have an array of
flavors, um, at any given point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd like to try to keep it,
um, you know, 50% gas, 50% fruity,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, any flavors, uh,
you know, Sativa dominant leaning,
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica dominant leaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely try to keep a nice,
well balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, customers can go back and,
and get something different, or they can
[SPEAKER_00]: have something, you know, for the daytime,
something for the nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, it's really important to have
well balanced flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when, when I talk to guests,
often we move into this idea of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of like a hierarchy of traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess I'd be interested in knowing
for you guys, what's your hierarchy if
[SPEAKER_02]: like, obviously, you know, in an ideal
world, everything looks great,
[SPEAKER_02]: smells great, hits great, you know,
but let's just say we had a plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe didn't look quite where you wanted
it to, but the effect was just
[SPEAKER_02]: unparalleled, just second to none.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you entertain that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you feel like it does sort of need
to be well rounded in a sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, um, it's a balanced combination of a
lot of different factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we really are looking for is
one, how does like, how is it growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's, that's the first thing is,
is it, is it, can it make it through the
[SPEAKER_01]: growth process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can it clone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we flower it is, are the buds,
is it not herming out?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first thing that we'll be
looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, I mean, really the first thing
is like the turps and smelling it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then it, then it goes to the growth
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as we're looking at how the plant
is growing, we then, if we have 10 seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: of one strain, let's say with the white
widow, for example, when we're hunting
[SPEAKER_01]: through that, we're looking at the growth
of each plant in addition to the terp
[SPEAKER_01]: profile and then, and the, the Nug
structure as well, while it's growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we can tell a lot of a plant while
it's still in the flowering room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's how we like, we originally
selected our winning, our winning white
[SPEAKER_01]: widow, Fino in the flower room,
because the turps were just out of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and out of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, none of the other Finos really,
really hit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the biggest thing is like looking at
the turps, but then it's also a large
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of the growth of the plant and
does it grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the right structure for how we farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then once we chop it, we have to
dry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to actually see how it smokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like with the white widow,
for example, we knew like that was
[SPEAKER_01]: destined to winner from the flower room,
but sometimes something will smell great
[SPEAKER_01]: in the flower room and then you dry it and
it's just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You read my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, I let's delve into that because I
was about to ask you and you just started
[SPEAKER_02]: answering it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was going to say it's obviously
genetic dependent, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on the strain, but in my
experience, I find exactly what you said,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Often you see a plant and it looks like
the winner and most of the time it does
[SPEAKER_02]: translate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always felt that was interesting,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as you said, looks doesn't
necessarily determine the effect,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I find a lot of the genetics I run,
it sort of does correlate, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that looks like the winner often
smokes the best as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that to be the case?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you think it's an exception to
the rule less of the time, or do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's, it's so variable.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really make these broad
statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's safe to say,
I mean, obviously there's some phenomenons
[SPEAKER_00]: like the old school cherry pie that
everyone talks about that would like herm
[SPEAKER_00]: out, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but other than that, if it,
if it's looking good and smelling good in
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower room, it's most likely if you
do a proper dry and cure gonna also be
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's another thing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not properly drying and,
and, and curing the flower, I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: harvests get absolutely ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because that process isn't handled
with care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and like Marco was saying most of
the time, if it seems good in the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: room, it's going to smoke well,
but there is, you know, time to time
[SPEAKER_01]: again, where you do, where you have a
strain that's just fire, but it
[SPEAKER_01]: occasionally herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of like, you have to make
the choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it that good that you want to keep
running it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or is that like, uh, you know,
is that a deal breaker?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we're hunting stuff,
it, it's really a combination of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we have to look at, like, I even
smelled the stem when it's vegging,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you rub the stem and see how it
smells in the vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes feeling the stems in the
vegetative growth can help you like,
[SPEAKER_01]: can really show you how resin is the
plants going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if it's just like, like stems can
straight up just be sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and sometimes Jake actually,
sorry, Jane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, no, no, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to Jake actually picked our
winning mimosa, Fino from a veggie mimosa
[SPEAKER_00]: clone that we had in the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just like super stinky?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was like, like me, I was looking
at the leaf structure, the, the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: internodal spacing as it veggies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's something that's very
important to how lanky is the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just super stacked where it's not
going to grow tall at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like that's the factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, yeah, like the,
like how the stem smells once you've been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it for a while, you really can kind
of start like telling which plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to, are going to do well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, on the topic of you mentioned
mimosa and a little earlier ghost train
[SPEAKER_02]: haze got mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you guys are one of the
smaller group of people who are putting
[SPEAKER_02]: out some very sort of sativa leaning
offerings in some strain and, and not just
[SPEAKER_02]: offering sort of these like middle of the
road hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious to know, do you find the
public reception for those sativas is
[SPEAKER_02]: good, or do you feel like people are a bit
hesitant compared to like gassy
[SPEAKER_02]: indicators?
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it all play out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think originally, you know, Southern
California was all about the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up smoking OG and especially LA
with, you know, the San Fernando Valley OG
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and Josh G and all like it California
has just been heavy with OG and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've always leaned like once I
started, once I started smoking sativas
[SPEAKER_00]: after being heavily smoking the OGs,
I just really started loving sativas a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, the fruitier strains and
I've absolutely seen a shift in the market
[SPEAKER_00]: and people being really receptive to our
sativa fruity strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, I think because a lot of growers
don't really grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really good for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a lot of positive feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I would say via because the
market has been growing a lot of just like
[SPEAKER_01]: cake strains and we've stayed away from
all the cake strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just a lot of that kind of
bland hybrids out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we bring something that's just
super fruity and pungent and it also hits
[SPEAKER_01]: the market definitely receives it well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's sort of the answer I was
hoping to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as sort of an extension of that idea,
do you guys in general prefer to run your
[SPEAKER_02]: own phenotype of a certain strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's like, it's a bit different to
what other people have to offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you feel like, you know,
when you've got an established clone,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a lot of the marketing's done for
you, like where do you sit on that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, so we're like a mix of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love running our own phenos because
nobody else has them and they're like our
[SPEAKER_01]: mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, for example,
the gelato 41 is probably one of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: gelato cuts out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are cultivating it to a really high
degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are strains like that,
that we like that, you know, you couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: grow without having the clone because it's
a clone only strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, we are trying to cultivate
our own phenos and phenol hunt everything
[SPEAKER_01]: in-house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually one day breed, but that's a
long time down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the more that we can cultivate
in-house and come out with our own phenos
[SPEAKER_01]: that nobody else has, it really helps kind
of create like a market for us that of
[SPEAKER_01]: strains that other people are not farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much of the market, you know,
a lot of these, a lot of people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize a lot of these brands,
they don't even cultivate their own flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just buying bulk flour from these
other farmers and slapping their label on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, it's, that's why the market
is just flooded with so much of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: boring cake strains and all that stuff is
because it's coming from the same batches
[SPEAKER_00]: even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just all these brands are calling it
their own when it was grown by the same
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, being able to differentiate
ourselves, not only just growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil, but then also having our own
phenos is, is absolutely what we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and Jake touched on maybe down the
road breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going, I was going to ask you that
question and sort of my thoughts have been
[SPEAKER_02]: for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I view the way the jungle boys did
their sort of seed operation as the way to
[SPEAKER_02]: do it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you spend years finding these unique
phenotypes, then you got this whole,
[SPEAKER_02]: whole pool of mothers to breed with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you say that sort of the plan for
you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: In major respect to the jungle boys,
they've, you know, created a phenomenal,
[SPEAKER_01]: just infrastructure of cultivation and
distribution and retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, they, their breeding program and
tissue culture program is definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: something to model after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my opinion, every hydroponic farm
across the world is modeling their
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic farm system after jungle boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's, that's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have your, you have to have
your genetic library.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you can, which jungle boys
did, if you can hunt males only in a room,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have flowered out entire rooms of
males.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, I hadn't heard of pollen
testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say testing, like what,
what were they actually testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, like visually or like doing like lab
testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, like they'll lab test for the terpene
profile in the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looping back to sort of one of the
questions we were talking about earlier,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're talking about pheno hunting
and stuff like that, and you're saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're sort of always looking for
an NL and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how much emphasis do you place on the
provenance of seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if some guy messaged you and says,
Hey, I got some old NL.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my gut instinct would be that that
might not be NL at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like where do you, do you feel
like you got to really make sure you
[SPEAKER_02]: source the stock or are you open to
hunting most things if they're given to
[SPEAKER_02]: you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're definitely, we can't be
because of the laws and the regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seeds that we have are the seeds
that we have to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the, the people that are
familiar with the metric system in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, it's just been very
challenging to really grow things that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it, yeah, it's a, it's pretty
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we don't, we're not,
we're not, we're not looking to basically
[SPEAKER_01]: take random seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a good seeds doc that we've been
hunting for a while or that we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: like saving for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what Marco was talking about,
it's the, it's this M metric M E T R C.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the software system that the state
requires licensed, all licensed cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the track and trace software.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically stuff has to be in
integrated in the system already for you
[SPEAKER_01]: to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we eventually want to get
into seed production so that we're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce our own genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, and it just like, it takes so
much time, effort, money, resources to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually pheno hunt a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want to know that if we're going
to hunt something that it's legit.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so we definitely don't,
don't take random seeds from random
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a totally understandable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's delve into some of the more,
the more technical aspects of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, but quickly, I'd love to ask what
inspired you guys to, to go down the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic cultivation side of things,
even before, say, you opened the facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: what was your entry into the organic
world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mountain organics, actually, you know,
he's kind of a, what we'd believe a legend
[SPEAKER_00]: in the space was one of, you know,
the earlier guys that was showcasing
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till on with cannabis indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just saw him on Instagram and we
just became absolutely fascinated that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to throw away soil,
that, you know, all these worms and
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms are living in these pots
and that it truly is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a healthier, better, turpier alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first side-by-side grow that I
had, um, growing just in regular soil
[SPEAKER_00]: versus, uh, no-till was so much of a
difference and just kind of never looked
[SPEAKER_00]: back after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a clear high, um, you know,
a turpier taste every, you just felt
[SPEAKER_00]: better smoking it ever since I grew my
first no-till pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a clear way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, knowing how small of a
cultivation we are just being Jake and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then, you know, we have eight and
employees, we knew going into the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: market that we had to do something
different anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so it just made even more sense
for us to grow indoor living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, what, what stimulated you to
transition from say like growing wherever
[SPEAKER_02]: you were before your current facility is
to being like, let's do this big
[SPEAKER_02]: operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there any, was it just a slow sort of
gradual thing or was there like a defining
[SPEAKER_02]: moment where you're like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I reckon we can pull it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, uh, it really was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in California cannabis became
recreationally legal on the, in the ballot
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2016 in November, it was voted in to be
recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, Marco and I grew up working in
the prop two 15 era and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: working with the shop and, um,
we had small, you know, a small grow
[SPEAKER_01]: before and we just, uh, the goal was to
join the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to transition out of what was the
medical market before, um, because the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole licensing structure is still a
learning process for everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: but each city is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so basically we had to make the
decision to stop trying to cultivate on
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't the licensed medical market
because now there's the licensed medical
[SPEAKER_01]: license recreational, but it's,
it's all together now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had to really make the decision
to stop doing everything we were doing and
[SPEAKER_01]: look at how we can get a license and get a
license in a city that will allow us to
[SPEAKER_01]: operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it just spent like, it spent a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, I spent a year looking for a building.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to get this building.
[SPEAKER_01]: We built it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We took a year to get another year to get
our building permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're two years in and then a year to
build the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically three years, we had to kind
of put everything on hold so we could go
[SPEAKER_01]: legal and not have to look over our
shoulder and not have to worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: getting everything chopped down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the money lost for no reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we, so we put everything on hold
and then we, uh, you know, we dove into
[SPEAKER_01]: the licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the license and I built the facility
and, uh, yeah, it's been a, it's been a
[SPEAKER_01]: gnarly gnarly process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, uh, I'm, I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to jump out, um, because of this
emergency, but, uh, I just wanted to say
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Australia for, uh,
keep doing your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, uh, you know, pushes forward there
into, into recreational sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, mad love to, to everyone that's a
growing cannabis and, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: following our journey and, and we just,
we appreciate all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so thank you so much for having us on
and, and, uh, Jake, Jake will take over
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care, Marco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thank you so much, Marco, for stopping
by.
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate your time and, uh,
hopefully, hopefully everything's all good
[SPEAKER_02]: and we can chat more in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, on that, on that topic,
Jake, do you find that the, the legal
[SPEAKER_02]: framework is still really challenging to
navigate or do you feel like you're at a
[SPEAKER_02]: point where, where it's sort of a little
bit of smooth sailing, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's still hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like for us, because we have the
license, it's not as bad now, but to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the license was just a nightmare and the
regulations are still evolving and
[SPEAKER_01]: changing on the city level and the state
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just like the taxes are
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and like certain licensing procedures
are changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is still, it's still evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a better place than I would say,
if you were like, just trying to get your
[SPEAKER_01]: license now, because it's just,
the market has become inundated over the
[SPEAKER_01]: last four years with so many people
getting licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, uh, it's been, it's been a wild
roller coaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and just as like a little followup,
I hear from lots of people who go through
[SPEAKER_02]: the trials and tribulations you just
mentioned, and sadly, many of them aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: able to get the license and or various
things happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of farmers who have ended up
ultimately leaving California,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause it's just, they feel like they've
been pushed out of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like that sort of,
um, sentiment has ever affected you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever considered leaving
California or was the goal always to do
[SPEAKER_02]: your thing there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I mean, we've just been like
extremely persistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm from, you know, I'm from San
Diego and, uh, in California and we're up
[SPEAKER_01]: in Long Beach now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we cultivate in Long Beach,
but I've never considered leaving
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in my opinion, it would be an,
I mean, it's really tough here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong, but it's going to be
tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be tough anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know any other area,
like another state to go operate in,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and to have the connections and,
you know, the, to build things and have
[SPEAKER_01]: contractors and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've kind of established a network
here, but thankfully we haven't had to
[SPEAKER_01]: consider leaving, but a lot, I mean,
it's just tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of farmers were left behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of that is like, it's a
combination of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some financial, a lot of it is
that the city that they are, that they
[SPEAKER_01]: live in or they're operating in just won't
license them because the city bans it
[SPEAKER_01]: still, or the County bans it still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's a lot of farms in what we
are considered unincorporated land where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not in us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, if you're in the city of Los
Angeles, for example, there's also the
[SPEAKER_01]: County of Los Angeles and the County has
been illegal for up until now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was a ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it got passed yet,
but the County did not have any licensing,
[SPEAKER_01]: only the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: The unincorporated land, which most land,
like in San Diego County, San Diego has a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of different cities and every single
city has a different licensing structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in order to get licensed in any
particular city, the city that you are
[SPEAKER_01]: operating in has to sign off on what
you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to, if you want to build a
cultivation facility in whatever city it
[SPEAKER_01]: is, that city has to have ordinance and a
licensing structure to grant you a city
[SPEAKER_01]: license.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the city that you are in will do that,
then the state will grant you a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do all the stuff you have to do to
get the state license, but it all hinges
[SPEAKER_01]: on the local, on the local area that
you're operating in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the biggest problem is that so
many cities in California just outright
[SPEAKER_01]: banned cannabis because they're just not
with it and they don't see the benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will change, but it's going to
take, it's going to take years and takes
[SPEAKER_01]: ballot initiatives and people to vote and
ordinances to get written.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a slow, slow process,
but that's why the black market has been
[SPEAKER_01]: fueled for the past, you know,
forever in California, because it's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: easier for these guys to just keep selling
on the black market because the city
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in won't even give them a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have for a long time wondered what
the, the landscape of the scene will be in
[SPEAKER_02]: say 10 to 15 years time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd love, I'd love to hear your
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think we're going to move more
towards like a jet, like an alcohol style
[SPEAKER_02]: model where, you know, there's maybe less
brands and there's like your Bud Light
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of equivalent or where do you think
we'll be in 10, 15 years?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a, it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it depends on if cannabis becomes
federally legalized in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that does happen and brands like us
or anybody that's legal in California or
[SPEAKER_01]: any other state, if we are allowed to sell
to other states legally, that will change
[SPEAKER_01]: the market a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, with that being said,
this is a brand new category of a
[SPEAKER_01]: commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like cannabis is one of the largest
agricultural crops by volume and dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: sold in the world now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially in the United States and in
California, it's like, it's a,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's in the top 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of that, we like the whole
cannabis industry has created an entirely
[SPEAKER_01]: new concept of how things like a whole new
category of things legally sold is now
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why there's, and like,
I'll get to the point that I'm making,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's why that there's all these,
we had to create stores just to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas there are individual liquor
stores, there's individual beer stores,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's all, but they also sell all of
those products at gas stations,
[SPEAKER_01]: at supermarkets, anywhere in the United
States is selling alcohol and liquor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a liquor license,
but with cannabis, we had to create an
[SPEAKER_01]: entire new structure of licensing and
retail stores and all of these new
[SPEAKER_01]: ordinances to sell this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if the regulations will
ever allow like a normal grocery store to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell cannabis or not, because this is a
brand new agricultural commodity that
[SPEAKER_01]: required all of these retail stores to be
opened purely to sell the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that like, that's the challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other challenge in the United
States is that even once it becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: federally legal, it's going to be
dependent on each state to create the
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say a state just outright bans
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, you know, it's, they might ban sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, there's a huge gray area in the
United States with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if a state is banning it, but it's
federally legal, can you go buy it in
[SPEAKER_01]: another state?
[SPEAKER_01]: And bring it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those tough things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once it goes federally legal,
it's going to be somewhat similar to what
[SPEAKER_01]: it is now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to be more available and
you'll be able to see brands that you
[SPEAKER_01]: might not have seen in a state because
they couldn't sell there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that, there's currently large
groups that are multi-state operators
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're in California, they're in
Michigan, in Florida, now in New Jersey
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: In New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of like, not a lot,
there's like a handful of large,
[SPEAKER_01]: large companies that have partnered with
some of the top brands that are from
[SPEAKER_01]: California so that they position
themselves to have the cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure in multiple states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because currently to sell in a particular
state, you have to grow it in that state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to sell weed in Florida, you have to
grow it in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: To sell weed in California legally,
you have to grow it in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a licensed facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also one of the craziest things
too, because no other agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: commodity is required to be sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everything from that region that is
grown, required to be sold in that same
[SPEAKER_01]: region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nothing could sell that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of the problem with the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's oversupply because everything has
to be sold in the state that it's grown
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a crazy concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you think of wine that comes
from, most of the wine produced in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia is produced for export.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're exporting it to other countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because no country could consume the
amount of agricultural commodities that
[SPEAKER_01]: the country produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're seeing with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's hurting the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also to touch on that point about the
brands and a big brand, the thing with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that is different than alcohol,
is even if there's a brand that becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Bud Light of cannabis,
it's such a challenging thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be the low quality weed
that is basically the same across all the
[SPEAKER_01]: states once it's federally legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want top quality flour,
stuff like that we're cultivating,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't reproduce that on a massive
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the challenge that these large
groups have been trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we can cultivate with 100 lights,
you can't replicate that and do 10,000
[SPEAKER_01]: lights and have it be the same quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the challenge with cannabis
because we're growing a dense flour that
[SPEAKER_01]: has a ton of moisture content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's so hard to standardize that on
a massive production scale and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: scale the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with beer, it's still hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they can't do the craft batch on a
massive scale either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of like that,
but cannabis has always started from that
[SPEAKER_01]: craft batch quality type of grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of the difference there
of what will be of like the massive
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor farms, just putting out flour
that's super cheap, that is the same
[SPEAKER_01]: basically, and like your top quality,
indoor grown 100 light facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's huge difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You nailed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was going to be one of the questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a quick follow-up, do you think the
answer then is if you can't scale up,
[SPEAKER_02]: if the quality starts to drop off at a
certain point, is the answer to set up a
[SPEAKER_02]: second facility somewhere else that
equally does a second small craft batch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's tough, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the reason that, you know,
part of the reason we're able to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality that we have right now is because,
you know, I'm here operating the facility
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everything that's coming through
our harvest room, my eyes are on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, until we can really put the
training in place and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the standard operating procedures to teach
all this stuff and replicate it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just tough because the one thing with
cannabis is a lot of it is nuanced,
[SPEAKER_01]: like how we dry stuff when it's 14 days
dry versus 16 days dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the moisture content in the stems
and the leaves and actually seeing the bud
[SPEAKER_01]: cure and all of those things, it all comes
with experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not what these large groups
are finding is that even if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: setting up 10 facilities that are all 200
lights, not every facility is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce the same quality because it's just
really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even for us, like personally,
if we were to do another facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: we would want to do a large greenhouse
because a lot of it would go for extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would also do some for flower,
but we know that we just can't produce the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of flower that we produce now on a
massive scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like either you want to stay quality and
do it small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's maybe one or two companies
right now that are, that have been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: scale and keep their quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cash intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: To actually build another facility and
then actually run it and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's definitely tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, I don't, I don't know that we
would even want to do another,
[SPEAKER_01]: another facility yet until we are,
until their demand is so high that like we
[SPEAKER_01]: can't even keep a jar on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it makes sense, but the demand's got
to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a final quick question on this sort
of discussion of scale, if you did scale
[SPEAKER_02]: up with your organic cultivation practice,
what is it in your mind that's the primary
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that affects the quality?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the pest pressure or is it just each
plant is getting less attention because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's more plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, it's a, like it could be a
combination of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as groups scale, it's hard to care as
much because you've got so much more
[SPEAKER_01]: volume that you're putting out and,
and so much more plant material to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if, there's a bad run, it's like,
oh well, there's another one coming down
[SPEAKER_01]: next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, it's just tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happens is that just keeps
continuing down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that runs bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well now everything is just mediocre.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and it's just tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think scaling is in cannabis is
like in the cultivation side of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is one of the toughest things to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's jump into some of the brass
tacks of some organic growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to know, what's the basic
composition of your soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the standard one, one, one ratio of
compost aeration peat moss?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it anything different?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we run the, like our base soil is
the build a soil 3.0 blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after we have that, that's a well
blended mixed, like living soil base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we get that, so if we like for,
for one room, it'll take about 20 yards of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, 20 cubic yards and 20 to 24 or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with that, we will then,
we're running 24 foot long growing beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're four feet wide by 24 feet long,
basically one meter, a little more than a
[SPEAKER_01]: meter wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, four feet wide by 24 feet long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put 10,000 worms per bed to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will also soil, we will test
the soil when we get it to see if we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to amend it with something else to kind of
help it get up to the elemental levels
[SPEAKER_01]: that we want to the mineral content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will let the worms kind of
work in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put mulch over it so the worms have
something to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then it's pretty much ready
to rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we continue growing in it,
we keep testing the soil so we can add the
[SPEAKER_01]: top dressings of the minerals that we
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as we water in biodynamic compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the compost that we use is extremely
rich in beneficial, beneficial fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: networks and nematodes and beneficial
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we water in what we call a compost
extract because we do not brew compost
[SPEAKER_01]: teas anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got away from that a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is because when you are
brewing a tea for an extended period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time, 12 or 24 hours, it has quite a high
chance of becoming anaerobic where it is
[SPEAKER_01]: without oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you put that into your soil,
you end up killing all of the beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and you end up in like,
you end up putting in anaerobic bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: which wants to like destroy the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely some wise words there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I myself have been guilty of using a pump
that was not sufficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I come back to my tea and I've got
cider.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can relate to that one for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask, do you use any microbial
supplements?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like mycorrhizae, trichoderma,
anything like that you specifically want
[SPEAKER_02]: to get in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we transplant, so whenever we
transplant clones into like a small pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: we use a powdered mycorrhizae and then
it's mixed with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll coat the roots with some
mycorrhizae and then also any time we
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant into our flowering beds,
we will put mycorrhizae on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we'll just spray with the water
solution, some mycorrhizae on the root
[SPEAKER_01]: ball to really help that network grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that you mentioned you
inoculate the soil with worms to begin
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of organic growers can sort
of understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question becomes, I know that Mountain
Organics uses some wetting agents and I
[SPEAKER_02]: know that some wetting agents like
saponins can be harmful to worms,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I haven't tested it in reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only read the literature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you use any sort of wetting agents or
saponins and do you feel like it has any
[SPEAKER_02]: effect on the worms or you think it's
probably a bit overblown?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not like we're not using stuff
like directly in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use the Mountain Organics botanical
tinctures that we foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, the worms,
when they're down in the soil protected by
[SPEAKER_01]: the mulch layer, if you're not put in
actually harmful stuff in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: most everything stays pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say for the most part,
the worms are pretty chill as long as the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment that they're in doesn't become
hostile.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty tough.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you do anything to your water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have to do anything to your water
or you find it's pretty good where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: at and you can just use it straight?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do reverse osmosis and that the main
reason is one, it gives us chlorine free
[SPEAKER_01]: water so that we're not harming the worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the problem with city water in
California, Long Beach, LA, is there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: much stuff in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly, we've got like a ton of nitrates
and chlorides and then chloramines as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem with chloride is that the
chloride will lock out nutrients and so by
[SPEAKER_01]: doing reverse osmosis, we keep it,
the water stays at a neutral pH right
[SPEAKER_01]: around seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that allows us to really like when we
water in our compost, it's just plain RO
[SPEAKER_01]: water mixed with compost and we just water
that into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the nutrients that we use,
which are from Organics Alive and they
[SPEAKER_01]: create basically a dehydrated powder that
is produced from a bacteria and so there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a specific bacteria and an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they're together, the by-product
is then dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the specific by-product that they make
is like, depending on the bacteria and
[SPEAKER_01]: enzyme that they're using, it creates an
NPK ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got four different bacterias
and enzymes that they use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have four different products
that all have a slightly different NPK
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like one is higher in nitrogen and
then one of them is higher in potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they've got one that's also
higher in phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those, the Organics Alive nutrients
that we use, along with some of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff from like soil symbiotics,
all like all made for living soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: having that neutral pH and by using RO
water really helps stabilize everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we do not pH the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will change slightly down to like a six
point three, six, between a six point two
[SPEAKER_01]: and six point five based on like the
nutrients that we're putting in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we lab test the nutrient water as
well to actually check everything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: in it and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So throughout the cycle, do you guys ever
top dress with amendments or is it more
[SPEAKER_02]: done at the end of the cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So normally when we transplant a room and
also keep in mind when we do transplant a
[SPEAKER_01]: room, it's not immediately flipped to
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually veg in the flower room for
about two weeks so that the plants can
[SPEAKER_01]: really soak their roots into the,
into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will top dress generally right when
we transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will try to top dress again
before week three of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so generally we'll have to do a soil
test about two weeks after we top dress so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can then have a new amendment made
for the, you know, the first two weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: three weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to clarify, it sounds like
whenever you're adding nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're basically going off tests and
you're not really like winging it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so we do a lot of soil analysis and we
work with this group called Cress of Soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and they help us dial in our actual
amendments that we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all based on like the soil core
sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we take core samples from each bed and
like we blend it together for one room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we send that out to a lab,
to Logan Labs here in, they're in Ohio in
[SPEAKER_01]: the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, and they analyze all the elemental
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: They check the pH of the soil and they
look at all the available new,
[SPEAKER_01]: like all the available minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that test, then we,
then that, then it changes what we amend
[SPEAKER_01]: with or the quantities of what we amend
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out of a personal curiosity,
to what degree do you allow beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes and biology to exist?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know sometimes I look at my pots
and I'm like, man, there's a lot of rove
[SPEAKER_02]: beetles and hypoapsis just running around
having a ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have to keep your eye on that or
you can just be comfortable letting it do
[SPEAKER_02]: its thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of it stays in check.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's a combination of the soil
biology as well as the elemental and
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the compost extract really helps the
soil biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also, one of the people from Crestive
is a microbiologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we haven't done it in a while,
but we need to do, start doing it more as
[SPEAKER_01]: we send soil samples to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she will look at it under a
microscope and actually chart the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria, like all the colonies of fungal
networks that are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that they can tell us,
are these beneficial?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria is this anaerobic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to start doing it more,
but that's how we check the health of that
[SPEAKER_01]: type of stuff is by doing, by looking at
the biological activity of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a general question, do you,
you know, like crop steering is like the
[SPEAKER_02]: trendiest word in the industry at the
moment, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm wondering, do any of those
specific protocols of how those soilless
[SPEAKER_02]: guys do crop steering, does any of that
translate to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are you doing anything that would
fall into that realm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think now we're still sort of
doing the more organic thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, are you talking about guys that
are all farming in rock wall?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess what I'm referring to is like,
you know, the way they do the temperatures
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're pumping certain nutrients at
certain times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like is any of that applicable?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like outside of the obvious difference in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so, um, when they're watering multiple
times per day, they're generally farming
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponically in rock wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also for people that aren't aware,
when we say farming hydroponically,
[SPEAKER_01]: we mean that someone is farming in a
soilless media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're farming without soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cocoa is a hydroponic media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and so was Rockwell, one of the
most famous ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, because it's so light and easy to
work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, we, we do not water like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also hand water, but Rockwell cubes
have to be watered four to five times a
[SPEAKER_01]: day, cause they dry out quickly as the
plants get so big in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that's not something that we have
to do with soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then there's also a blend of
people farming in soil pots using
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens there is that they end up
throwing away all their soil each round.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, whereas we're able to reuse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like in one of our rooms, we're on our
13th cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we have harvested it 12 times
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's the dream, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, um, I did want to ask you, cause I saw
that post.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that theoretically soil can
be used infinitely or do you think that
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, at a certain point,
it might be beneficial to get a new batch?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think that as long as we're amending
it properly, it will get better with time
[SPEAKER_01]: and the worms will keep working it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, it's, it's kind of a,
it's a strange thing because when you farm
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors, there is there's not a long off
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a normal indoor farm can realistically
get four to five harvests a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they time it all 60 days apart,
they can get five harvests a year because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just replacing the growing media
every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in living soil, we really can only
max out at four harvests a year because we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to let the soil rest in between
harvests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, it's one of the things that
we just have to do in order to farm in
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil and to produce a higher
quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and with that, if we keep amending it
and working it, it will get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the difference between farming indoors
in living soil and like rotating your
[SPEAKER_01]: crops on like four acres of land,
where let's say you grow on this acre and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you rotate and you grow something
else, it's just different because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing the same, you know, we're,
we're growing different strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're farming cannabis in this same
body of soil over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it will get better, but we have to
actively work every month to amend it and
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure otherwise it does get depleted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll see that in the runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in terms of when you're amending at
the end of a cycle, what sort of nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: are coming up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is it like, it's, it's mostly a lot
of nitrogen and calcium we're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: replace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what sort of things are you commonly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we're replacing nitrogen,
calcium, phosphorus, uh, like amino acids
[SPEAKER_01]: from all the trace minerals as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you've got like, you know,
iron, copper, other trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so it's a combination of
everything that, that has to get
[SPEAKER_01]: replenished.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, we can tell that by testing
the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the question I wanted to ask you most
prominently in this whole interview was,
[SPEAKER_02]: how do you deal with IPM?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to imagine this is one of the big
issues on scale for you guys is your pest
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of your protocols for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's a combination of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, first and foremost is keeping the
facility clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you farm in living soil,
there are bugs and that's just part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soil food web is there's a balance
of beneficial bugs in there and beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: insects that are going to be in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we've had fungus gnats in the past,
we've, uh, put in nematodes into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we water in, uh, nematodes and
those really help kind of clear stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also use sticky fly traps everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we spray them out in organics,
botanical tinctures in veg, which is all
[SPEAKER_01]: like all organic ingredients in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the, like the peppermint and stuff
that's in the botanical tincture,
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff really helps with the,
you know, the leafs and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and like thrips and stuff that could
like be living on the leafs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of in the soil, like,
if you look at our soil, you'll see all
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts of stuff crawling around in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's beneficial, uh, we've got like
beneficial mites in the soil that have
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of just appeared over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, all that stuff is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just stays, it stays in the soil
and it's helping work the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the biggest thing is we use
mountain organics, botanical tinctures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that would be like our main spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to put that on the IPM list,
it would be like the mountain organics,
[SPEAKER_01]: botanical tinctures, um, as well as just
really trying to keep a clean environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the nematodes are a huge IPM,
uh, protocol as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because those get watered in and they
really help the soil out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, just really trying to keep
everything healthy and just inspecting,
[SPEAKER_01]: inspecting the plants regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you were to get some sort,
let's just, let's just hypothetically,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's say you've got a mite infestation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something which with your
facility, you'd be able to handle
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonably easier?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a bit of an uphill one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, I feel like with like spider
mites, you have to really be negligent to
[SPEAKER_01]: like, for it to become a massive problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like, if you aren't inspecting the
plants regularly and you don't see that
[SPEAKER_01]: the mites are starting to appear,
um, it's like, it's just not good in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you might have PM on your buds at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and so I feel like anything that
is bad, like if you notice it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just got to get it out right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if you're doing a spray regularly
and like ours is all organic a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent, but other, other farms that are
spraying a pesticide every, every week,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I mean, that normally does it for
them, but like we're spraying only organic
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to do it just as fine as
well without harming the beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: insects that are in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: A brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the, uh, Patreon submitted
questions we got from one of our listeners
[SPEAKER_02]: was they're big fans and they wanted to
know, you know, do you still have the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene content displayed on the
packaging?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think that that sort of
education is translating to the consumer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do put our terpene graph,
uh, on the back of our box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we've been using that now for a bit
and people definitely like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, I think it's still new,
like people looking at the terps that are
[SPEAKER_01]: on it, but it really helps, you know,
it helps kind of catch the eye to our box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it helps us display the strain
name as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it definitely it's taken time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people still care about THC,
but thankfully for our brand, not as many
[SPEAKER_01]: people care about the THC numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really about the quality of the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, it's, it's hard to say like
the knowledge of terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: different terpenes and how they,
and how people like the different flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still kind of evolving and,
uh, people are being educated at the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries, you know, what are terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what are all these things listed on
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it just takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still, it's getting there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, a lot of people are being
educated about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think us having it on the box,
it really helps show the consumer,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what, what are the eight like
prominent terpenes that are in this
[SPEAKER_01]: specific batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and for like people that buy our
flower regularly, they'll see batch to
[SPEAKER_01]: batch the, the terpenes change a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, we want it to be as
consistent as possible, but when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: farming something like this, there's going
to be a little bit of changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think as people see that over
time, like, you know, they'll really start
[SPEAKER_01]: to get a good idea of, Hey, I like this
strain because it has this terpene in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, stuff like that,
but it's just, it's kind of still a little
[SPEAKER_01]: early and not a lot of people are,
you know, yeah, it's still early and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just being educated still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another question we got from one of our
Patreon supporters was, are you under any
[SPEAKER_02]: additional or more stringent testing in
regards to like, you know, how we talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about like CFU units on the plant and
because we use beneficial microbes that
[SPEAKER_02]: might play into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that affect you any differently to
anyone else or it's all pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: straightforward, easy sailing?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything gets tested the same in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's like, we're tested for a
whole list of pesticides, uh, and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything heavy metals, the, the,
like the, the microbial test test for five
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've definitely gotten that question
before, cause people will think,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll hear, Hey, you're watering in all
this biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it not just on the buds?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's definitely not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what we put into the soil stays in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really, the biggest thing in
farming when you're farming cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors is the grow environment and the
temperature and humidity that you keep in
[SPEAKER_01]: the room, as well as the airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what causes microbial contamination
is when you don't have the right VPD,
[SPEAKER_01]: where your, your vapor pressure deficit is
off and your temperatures and humidities
[SPEAKER_01]: are not correlated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can get mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what causes all the issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, another listener was keen to know
what's the biggest challenge you've faced
[SPEAKER_02]: in running the facility in today's market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel like people are becoming
more interested in organic cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say people definitely are
becoming more interested, um, in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, living soil, organically farmed
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with cannabis, it just takes
more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but as people, you know, are
demanding, more living soil products,
[SPEAKER_01]: we hope to be positioned where we are one
of the original living soil brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's just, it's just tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, I mean, I don't know what the
toughest thing would be that we've faced
[SPEAKER_01]: in today's market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like everything is super tough,
just cultivating legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, just building the facility,
the licensing, like it's all super tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think it's just like the
toughest thing is just like having faith
[SPEAKER_01]: and staying persistent to actually execute
on our plan because it takes months to
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have to dry it and trim it and
package it and then sell it and sell it in
[SPEAKER_01]: a reasonably quick manner so that it's
fresh and that it doesn't sit and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, become old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just like, I kind of describe
our facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like having 10, like, you know,
car engines running 24 seven that you
[SPEAKER_01]: always have to be keeping up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, things can go wrong,
but it, it's just like, it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so many moving parts with all the
dehumidifiers and the ACs and the water
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many moving parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, it's definitely tough to run a
legal cannabis business just overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get heckled if I don't, I want to ask
you, what's your favorite organic
[SPEAKER_02]: amendment and your least favorite?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll, I'll give you mine quickly so
you don't feel like you're getting thrown
[SPEAKER_02]: under the bus.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite input is oyster shell flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, my least favorite would be
dolomite because it screws your soil up
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know, like, I don't know
what my favorite amendment would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like because we amend with a lot of
different things, I, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I like, I like the blend of everything
that we use and it kind of, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, oyster shell is very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice, you know, like soft powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, definitely nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the, the, the soil likes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like gypsum also gypsum is good to
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know what I, I mean,
I don't really like neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, we're not, we're not big on neem
and like neem cake and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neem can sometimes harm the biology,
but like, like some products, some
[SPEAKER_01]: products have neem and a little bit in it
and that's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't, we try not to put a ton of
neem into the soil or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we don't really put any, um,
and like, like neem seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really, I haven't liked using
neem seed meal before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, it's not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people, including myself
use a lot of neem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that that's cool to hear that there's
another side to the coin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've certainly heard and read about
some of those negative things about neem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone go read into it a bit more for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So final question before we do the quick
five at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you care about the whole so-called
clean smoke, white ash debate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like, do you think that because you're
coming from this organic background,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, it's sort of a bit irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good, good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there's two sides to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you farm high, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me preface it with living soil and how
we approach it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you are farming in living soil,
it's not as big of a deal and it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: clear indicator that this is good or this
is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that said, uh, when you do farm
in living soil and the plant ripens at the
[SPEAKER_01]: right rate and is cut when it's mature and
ready to be harvested, the ash should be
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's mixed a little bit,
kind of salt and pepper looking,
[SPEAKER_01]: it should have a nice looking ash and it
should hold together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and part of that comes with the
plant dying appropriately and being at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of its life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the soil is healthy, the plant
will ripen on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we all, we will water with plain water
for the last week, usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so when we're in living soil,
it's not as big of a deal because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: still nutrients in our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not flushing out all the nutrients
by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still, a lot of nutrient content
in the soil, but the plant is ripening on
[SPEAKER_01]: its own and ready to be harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that is the case, it should have
a good ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's dried properly, if everything
else is done properly, it should have a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice looking ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on the flip side, when you farm
hydroponically, the reason that white ash,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the reason in cannabis, why white ash
is, uh, preferred is because hydroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: farming is what kind of jumpstarted
cannabis into the culture that it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you farm hydroponically,
you have to flush out the nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: because you don't want to smoke the
synthetic nutrients that you're feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in hydroponic farming, a white ash
can sometimes indicate that this has been
[SPEAKER_01]: flushed better than let's say if it's
darker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the difference on the white ash
debate when you farm hydroponically versus
[SPEAKER_01]: when you farm in living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone should, uh, should just growing
living soil and then it's not a big issue,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that brings us on to our tail end and
what we call our final five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first question I want to ask you,
what is the single most memorable
[SPEAKER_02]: experience you've had with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't necessarily need to be like
the most potent hit, but just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe you're at the creek and
you went for a swim and just like
[SPEAKER_02]: everything was just hitting right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what's the most memorable thing for
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably like, I'm just like tracing
through my head, like racing through my
[SPEAKER_01]: brain right now, thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I popped to when I harvested my first
flower successfully, um, because before,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was like three clones that I had
grown outside in San Diego that I got from
[SPEAKER_01]: clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause before that I grew probably 15 or 17
plants and they all died.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nothing came out, but there was no
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I finally, after a summer
successfully harvested these clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's probably one of the most
memorable things of like actually being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to harvest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was an SFV cut and,
uh, it smoked really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that kind of was like,
wow, like you can grow this plant and then
[SPEAKER_01]: if you do everything right, you can then
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, I always knew like,
I love smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to grow this cause I don't,
I want to be able to produce it for
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that was a huge point for me to
actually successfully harvest the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: after failing, like literally 17 times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many aspects, like the
realization of self reliance is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, as a quick, super quick follow
up, do you think the fact you harvested an
[SPEAKER_02]: SFV might've been the stepping stone for
why you love gas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, maybe, I mean, not just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I also worked at, I ran this shop and
like, we only sold OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was just, I've been brought up on
OG and like some of the best OGs in LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely what I like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, uh, I think a lot,
like for like heavy, heavy smokers,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of heavy smokers like, like those
kind of like deeper strains, but I also
[SPEAKER_01]: love smoking fruity stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just, you know, it's all a
different time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, don't you worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to, when I hang up this call,
I'm going to smoke some biscotti pancakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so on the other end of the spectrum
quickly, what's a strain where like
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone was hyping it up when it came out
and you were super keen to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you finally tried it,
you were like, Oh, is that it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I try to just smoke like the,
like fire ass stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, it's, uh, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've been smoking what we grow for a
while, but let me think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a hyped up strain that I've like
tried that I didn't, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to put any brands on blast,
but there's some of the top brands that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been grown, like some of their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fallen off and it's just like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we were talking about back
to the scale is like, you just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't scale with the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like, there's been like some
of the top, top brands that, that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: think of, uh, their batches just aren't
quite there anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like stuff that I might've
wanted to try of the strains that they
[SPEAKER_01]: were growing three years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to try anymore because
it's just like, you know, that the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: is not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say it's more, it's more stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I'm trying to think of this,
like, I mean, jungle boys grow a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll even admit they've got some
batches that aren't the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I feel like when I, uh,
all the stuff I used to pick up before we
[SPEAKER_01]: were cultivating here, like I was,
you know, I'm very particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: like super particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, I feel like even if I picked
a bad one, it's still kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, all right, you know,
um, oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one strain I remember that I was
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like dispensary time was called snow cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was, uh, I thought it was
going to be great, but it was just like a
[SPEAKER_01]: terrible representation of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was just like, it's not like,
Hey, I mean, it was terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and the guy was hyping it up and it
was just like, man, this, what am I going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, that's one I could remember
that was like, Oh, this is not,
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought this was going to be great.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember having some snow cap a long
time ago that it wasn't particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: memorable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, next question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I want to say it cause you
won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was in the States recently,
I had a lot of good connected Cali stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but high rise from connected California
was shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they also had some great stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their Jelenaid was sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's, that's exactly my point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they, they've got great, great
genetics, but they just are the scale is
[SPEAKER_01]: losing the quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next quick fire one is I'm going to
drop you off on a desert Island and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can take three strains with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be clones or they could be seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to maybe do some breeding,
what are you going to take with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, definitely like the best OG cut that
you got, uh, probably, yeah, like Josh D
[SPEAKER_01]: like one of, one of his cuts of OG,
whatever the best cush that they have
[SPEAKER_01]: right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then I really do like gelato 41 a
lot, like it's fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that strain is dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say the best OG and then gelato
41.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I need a, I need like a Sativa
strain too for the desert Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a strain that I haven't been
able to get in a long time, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: called Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Thunderfuck and that strain is like
the craziest Sativa that you've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love to have that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those three.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, some good picks there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can throw all the hate you want at me,
but gelato 41 slaps.
Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next one, this one's a little variant,
a second last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a variant from what we normally do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give you a time machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go anywhere, you know,
in history, and around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're there, you're going to
collect a big bag of humus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you want to get humus from
throughout history?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'd have to go like hundreds
of years back, like maybe like a few
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand years to get some like nice,
like untouched, like volcanic soil that
[SPEAKER_01]: hasn't been tainted with pesticides and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, like at least, you know,
2000 years, probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get, let's get that Nazareth Jesus
OG going for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, yeah, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's still like, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'll give you the final question we
always ask people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give you a time machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go back in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do whatever you want, but this
time you're going to collect some seeds or
[SPEAKER_02]: a cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you going to go?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you going to get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, where would I go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, I would go back to the
nineties and get a cut of OG with like the
[SPEAKER_01]: original Kush crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, cause that's like, that's,
that's like one of the like Kush at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time was like the top of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would get like a real cut of OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end of it for today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there any general comments or shout
outs you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're, uh, you know, shout out to
you guys that want to listen to this and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hear us talk about living soil
and kind of what we're doing here at
[SPEAKER_01]: no-till Kings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're definitely trying to cultivate,
you know, the highest quality flower that
[SPEAKER_01]: is available on the rec market,
um, and be consistent with it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the toughest thing is
just being consistent batch after batch at
[SPEAKER_01]: like a really elite level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's definitely just tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're working hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a super small team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and we're working really hard to
cultivate the highest quality cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the message.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, a huge shout out to both Jake
