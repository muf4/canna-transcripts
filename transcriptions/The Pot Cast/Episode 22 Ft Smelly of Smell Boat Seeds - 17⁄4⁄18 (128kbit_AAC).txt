[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty so a big welcome and thank you
for smelling mad for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask a little deviant from the
normal first question We almost got into
[SPEAKER_00]: it a second ago, but I want you to tell me
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you smoking on at the moment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of rainbow just lots of lots of
rainbow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some rainbow hybrids as well But
nothing really beats rainbow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just don't get tired over or haven't
yet So you just smoke in the pure?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the rainbow SS og I've had a little
bit of the skittles by rainbow as well
[SPEAKER_03]: lately and it's been super good But it's
hard the rainbow SS just has that dankness
[SPEAKER_03]: to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't get enough of that chocolatey
rankness All right, well, I mean we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a plethora of questions to ask on that But
we'll put that aside for the moment jump
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was in fact your first experience
with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh I was born into it like my first memory
in life was a being on the boat I was I
[SPEAKER_03]: couldn't have been more than like two or
three and I was up on the lake with my
[SPEAKER_03]: Uncle and everywhere we went with my dad
my uncle it smelled like skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really didn't know why we always
smelled skunks And then as I got older and
[SPEAKER_03]: realized it was the cannabis that always
made it smell like skunk that you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was kind of a Just like a part of life
with with me growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just always around cannabis and So I
got this kind of theory that the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: you're exposed to when you're early on can
often be some of the stuff Which is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the most impacting on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that to be the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean if we look at your work that you
know, there doesn't seem to be Any
[SPEAKER_00]: apparent skunky stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it just a memory or is it kind of
imprinted on you in the way I described?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I chased the skunks forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have a lot of skunk work and
rainbow has a so much of the tie in it and
[SPEAKER_03]: That was always a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why I went down the rainbow
journey Is because my dad always talked
[SPEAKER_03]: about the chocolate ties the chocolate
ties the chocolate ties and then the
[SPEAKER_03]: Acapulco gold which hopefully I work with
down the down the line so he always told
[SPEAKER_03]: me about like in the 70s they would get
these these sticks the that tasted like
[SPEAKER_03]: chocolate and So they would smoke it
tastes like chocolate and it was always
[SPEAKER_03]: something I was all like wait weed that
tastes like chocolate You know as a kid
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm a candy junkie still to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Love making candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't eat store-bought candy I make
candy and just so I can get rid of that
[SPEAKER_03]: craving So that's why I started the
rainbow really was on that that tip the
[SPEAKER_00]: the ties Wow, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So What was when you were younger and you
first started smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any idea of what would come at
some of the strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually first exposed to when you
were smoking and were they more indica or
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it really depends there was two
different types One during the harvests
[SPEAKER_03]: and humble all the outdoor that was going
around Most of it was just called like
[SPEAKER_03]: green bud or kind but we did get things
like northern lights and we did get a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of Calio my dad had a lot of Calio around
and then there was a lot of South American
[SPEAKER_03]: type strengths that my dad had in seed
form.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they grew a lot of that but believe it
or not a lot of the stuff and the Because
[SPEAKER_03]: we had dry seasons around here where the
outdoor growers were out of cannabis so we
[SPEAKER_03]: had a lot of commercial flower coming up
from Mexico and So we smoked a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial flower to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it was a lot of it was the orange
influences So it was what now we know as
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Calio or those kind of strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was so much of this lime green
smelled like straight orange trees and
[SPEAKER_03]: That was truly one of my favorites and
that's why you'll see in a lot of my other
[SPEAKER_03]: early work.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of Orange influences in
there because it reminded me of you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: 13 14 year olds Pulling apart these bricks
and smelling that orange juice just hit me
[SPEAKER_00]: in the face That's really interesting
because this possibly the first time we've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever heard someone express the sentiment
that you know They they had some really
[SPEAKER_00]: nice kind of brick we'd sent in
essentially The interesting thing about
[SPEAKER_00]: Calio is I was chatting about this the
other day to Adam Dunn It's it's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those ones which is really The defining
example of like how things come in waves
[SPEAKER_00]: of popularity, you know, like it used to
be big It fell off a bit then we had the
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy resurgence I don't know if you'd say
it's fallen off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, it's it's not at the peak
anymore Do you foresee it coming back
[SPEAKER_00]: soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly as you alluded Do you
think that those orange vibes do trace
[SPEAKER_00]: directly back to like the Mexican land
races specifically?
[SPEAKER_03]: I Personally I'm gonna start with the last
part first I personally think that it does
[SPEAKER_03]: come from from the Mexican strains It's
importing tons of kilos of cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_03]: 70s and 80s and so much of it was orange
smelling flavoring cannabis he told me
[SPEAKER_03]: tons of stories about it and So like
California and Mexico were together,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's just it's one thing so if
it was grown in Mexico is grown in
[SPEAKER_03]: California and That's where my belief
would lie with the orange is that it was
[SPEAKER_03]: coming up from Cal Mexico and you know
compressed commercial and the seeds were
[SPEAKER_03]: very few and these bricks and When you
found these seeds you kept them and you
[SPEAKER_03]: grew them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't Say his name but my dad had a
really good friend that he worked with
[SPEAKER_03]: through Mexico that he brought him up and
He's still with us today My dad isn't but
[SPEAKER_03]: his friend is and I've had the
conversation with him where he said that
[SPEAKER_03]: when he was a kid That was what was
prevalent area of Mexico was the orange
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was everything smelled orange The
second part which was the first part do I
[SPEAKER_03]: believe it'll come back, you know,
I Feel when I open a jar of the orange
[SPEAKER_03]: flower and I get that nice zesty orange in
the morning It helps wake me up in the
[SPEAKER_03]: morning, you know, it helps get me going
like a cup of coffee Just the terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: profile of it the way it activates my
brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, it'll never go away I'll always
grow something with that orange profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll always have something Just for my own
personal use.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of the guys like
that as well who remember it from the 80s
[SPEAKER_03]: and the 90s or even further back So
they'll always have it around if it gets
[SPEAKER_03]: to the trendy area again I think so many
people worked with tangy and so many
[SPEAKER_03]: people Crossed with tangy and grew tangy
and that's all you heard was tangy and
[SPEAKER_03]: orange This orange that I think a lot of
the younger guys are burnt out on it So
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll be a while before it hits to where
it was five six years ago Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a that's a really good way to
express it I kind of think I'm definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: in agreements with you on that one the
interesting thing that the Kind of tangy
[SPEAKER_00]: wave did bring to the forefront I think is
the idea of turps and maybe kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: more underlying argument of possibly turps
being more important Than potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean for me tangy was one of those ones
where it often both from me and from
[SPEAKER_00]: people I know cop criticism in regards to
the potency, but you know, it got
[SPEAKER_00]: compliments in regards to the terpene So
like do you feel that's kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: representative of the scene and the way
breeding is occurring in general at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's kind of funny like what was it
four or five years ago everything even
[SPEAKER_03]: more recently But I'm gonna say that time
where people were showing off these huge
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers and their What they were breeder
what they being tested at and all these
[SPEAKER_03]: massive 30% 32% Well, somebody was always
one up and somebody Started more breeders
[SPEAKER_03]: Using profile the terpene profile and not
just like oh look, it's fruity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's orange But like I mean or it's grapey
or like purple punch for instance I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: how many people are working with purple
punch right now and Everybody has the same
[SPEAKER_03]: chief complaint.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't get you there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't Have that punch that they
should just be called purple or they talk
[SPEAKER_03]: down about it But the flavor of it is so
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is and How long have people been
smoking cigars just to have the flavor?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't inhale a cigar.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just smoke it just to taste it and So
I always think that we will have that I
[SPEAKER_03]: always think that now that people really
have isolated terpenes in the certain
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrates and Oils and things like that
now I think it's gonna get grow even
[SPEAKER_03]: further because of that like so let's say
you can isolate the One from this strain,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you can add it to this concentrate to
make this type of sauce That's where so
[SPEAKER_03]: many people are going You go walk around
the shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many shows do you go to now or tables?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you go to a booth where you see like
amazing flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not as often where you see
concentrate everywhere and that terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: profile Is what's selling those
concentrates?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do I really do think that the
terpenes The smells the flavors and the
[SPEAKER_00]: taste will that's where most breeders are
at right now Yeah So last little question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask about the orange slash.
[SPEAKER_00]: How should I say tangy terpenes for the
moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been some rumors that the Tangy
may not be the genetics that it says it is
[SPEAKER_00]: have you heard anything about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you shed any light?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard a ton of people say I Truly
don't know what they claim that tangy is I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't I it wasn't something I was super
fired up about I Always had Calio.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had Calio since one of my first moms
so When the tangy came out and people were
[SPEAKER_03]: smelling it and showing it and saying hey
check this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was all oh, it's kind of like What I've
been growing for all these years,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I love that strain like I love it They
were like, well, it's called tangy and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: all well tangy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's confusing to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what is tangy?
[SPEAKER_03]: I Believe they say it's like a skunk an
orange skunk something like that but
[SPEAKER_03]: Crossed a Calio Okay, so they say it's a
skunk cross to Calio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Okay, so I could imagine it being a
Calio cross my only Thing with it is is it
[SPEAKER_03]: has a chemically orange now I know Calio I
can I can smell Calio I can taste Calio I
[SPEAKER_03]: can do all that now could a skunk change
that in the in the gene pool sure sure it
[SPEAKER_03]: could but to me like there is a what's his
name the breeder who did the Agent orange
[SPEAKER_03]: so so I first there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally think that the tangy would be
more of the agent orange Style of terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: because I've smelled that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, they're all gonna come from
the same gene pool but I don't know to me
[SPEAKER_03]: the Tangy has more of that chemical orange
or Calio has a more of a sweet mundane
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange juicy smell Yeah, okay interesting
so Jumping back to kind of the earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it that initially inspired you to
breed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it something that happened or was it
another breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the ball rolling for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Wanted to make strange with me honestly
when I started I've been doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was one of my first projects my first
some of my first projects I was trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: recreate a big Korean skunk things like
that the old Asian lines so I was getting
[SPEAKER_03]: a bunch of those kind of lines and I was
working with them and Stuff so I was
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to make the old like 70s style In
seed form, you know so I could enjoy it
[SPEAKER_03]: with my dad and stuff like that and I was
growing a ton of like Mexican seeds in the
[SPEAKER_03]: early 90s and things like that for him and
he'd be able to come over to the house and
[SPEAKER_03]: Like see my little I wouldn't call them
little bushes my monster like 10 foot wide
[SPEAKER_03]: bushes and things and be able to pick
flowers off because he literally come over
[SPEAKER_03]: chop them off fresh take them home and
drank here on himself because I just
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't do it right So our styles are
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I let I leave leaves on so everything gets
chopped with all the leaves gets trimmed
[SPEAKER_03]: later He trimmed everything off when it
was still wet and hung it that way,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's beyond the point So that was
really what it was is that I liked
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and I didn't want to Try to buy a
clone from somebody so they knew I was
[SPEAKER_03]: growing, you know, because it wasn't
always legal to grow these giant grows I
[SPEAKER_03]: was doing were not Medical clothes these
were in the middle of manzanita trees and
[SPEAKER_03]: buckets or on the side of mountains where
I was falling in with rattlesnakes and
[SPEAKER_03]: Climbing up on my gut and trying to find
water to take up to these mountains and so
[SPEAKER_03]: that was really the reason why I started
to do the breeding was because I wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: Create stuff where nobody else knew I was
still growing I wanted to have my own
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds and be sufficient on my own Merit
and not try to find clones because there
[SPEAKER_03]: were clones at the time They just weren't
amazing Going back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I still had some of those clones I
mean, I remember when Romulan first came
[SPEAKER_03]: around and I passed on it and I still kick
myself and they asked every day for
[SPEAKER_00]: passing on that cut Yeah, Romulan's one of
the interesting ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost had a resurgence in popularity
the thing which I find most interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: about Romulan is as far as I can tell
seems to be the oldest clone That there is
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak like it's popped in 69 as far
as we can tell Have you heard of anything
[SPEAKER_03]: older than that seems like it might be the
one I'm confused on Romulan because I was
[SPEAKER_03]: under the oppression.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was named after the Star Trek
Generation the Romulans.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when people tell me that it was Created
that long ago and named after Star Trek.
[SPEAKER_03]: It blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that part always confuses me but yeah I
don't really think a lot of the old
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders were naming stuff Like I had an
issue even naming stuff like where it
[SPEAKER_03]: would just be I never put a name on it So
I think that's why it's harder to date the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis because there wasn't a name
things weren't passed freely everything
[SPEAKER_03]: was kept Under lock and key.
[SPEAKER_03]: So dating things is truly truly hard
Everything is hearsay or somebody else's
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Word of mouth and it's a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I just don't like to have because people
like to take credit for things when Maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: that was around before they you know took
credit for it or maybe it wasn't or maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: they did Create it and if I say something
and somebody takes offense to what I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: saying it causes a big drama So I just let
people say what they want to say and claim
[SPEAKER_00]: what they want to claim Yeah, I can I can
certainly understand that So, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about that Romulan one myself
like it comes from Romulan Joe and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that he adopted that persona after You
know, maybe it's controversial but after
[SPEAKER_00]: he was had the Mendojo persona So,
you know if I had to guess he was Mendojo
[SPEAKER_00]: and had the cut before he was Romulan Joe
So he mustn't have been calling it Romulan
[SPEAKER_00]: back there But yeah, I think you're right
like that reference of the word Romulan
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really seem to be around before
Star Trek So yeah interesting one with
[SPEAKER_00]: that being said though Excluding Romulan
seeing as maybe it's not I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that clones pretty old but
regardless What do you know is to be or
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you think at least is the oldest
clone that you're aware of?
[SPEAKER_00]: The oldest actual cut like yeah,
like I mean obviously it's a cut of a cut
[SPEAKER_00]: of a cut but like, you know It's still the
same plan as the original one so some of
[SPEAKER_03]: my So, let me let me think of this real
quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny because some of the original
clones I was seeing were literally called
[SPEAKER_03]: kind buds or Green buds or orange bud,
which was later known as Calio Those were
[SPEAKER_03]: the ones that I remember seeing when I was
young and then you had your your South
[SPEAKER_03]: American strains or your gold strains and
things like that And once again,
[SPEAKER_03]: I seen these when I was a kid,
but they never had a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called Oh, that's that the kind bud
or that's the San Diego buds or that is
[SPEAKER_03]: the green or that is the orange or that's
that Colombian that we have And then the
[SPEAKER_03]: other one was that the Micho Khan I think
honestly one of the oldest ones I remember
[SPEAKER_03]: was just the Micho Khan Because that's
what was getting brought over in abundance
[SPEAKER_03]: and the brick Other than that,
I've heard of things, you know things but
[SPEAKER_03]: I did See them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was born in 1977 I have memories,
you know into the 80s and those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones I'll speak on Yeah, okay so I think
something which has been really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to me and probably to many a
lot of other people as well is the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think it was at least that in
your mind that caused you to take such a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a different approach to your
brother in regards to breeding because I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean he put it I think pretty Eloquently
himself like, you know, he's got a very
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of small pool that he sticks with and
and you cover everything else And I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like that's a good way of putting it,
you know, like how did it end up to be
[SPEAKER_00]: that way?
[SPEAKER_03]: I You know Okay, so mad really worked the
same pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was really dedicated to Oracle in the
lab under and the SCDC those were his
[SPEAKER_03]: Babies and he works them still to this day
and I'm actually happy that he he's adding
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit of my work to the pool
Because my my work is all at his works
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing and I think they'll play really
really well together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I Think a lot of my difference with it
was was that I didn't want to just do the
[SPEAKER_03]: same thing I had a lot of different
versions of plants at my disposal like he
[SPEAKER_03]: had His purples I was really working the
like the Micho Khan at the time or these
[SPEAKER_03]: ties at the time or Calio those were the
ones but also I was all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Was traveling everywhere I was working
tons tons tons in the outdoors and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing a lot more of what I could push
plants to yield For you know reasons lots
[SPEAKER_03]: of flower Bigger yields bigger plants
those kind of things for outdoor growing
[SPEAKER_03]: was really really what I was looking for
and plus I would read for myself what I
[SPEAKER_03]: liked what I I really liked the tie The
chocolate cherry like I was saying was way
[SPEAKER_03]: too strong for me If I worked it Settled
it down a little bit and I could make it
[SPEAKER_03]: very beneficial For me, I just take away
that peak of the high but keep all the
[SPEAKER_03]: parts that made you smile and you happy
and So I think we just really had
[SPEAKER_03]: different visions on what we wanted to do
I think he really really wanted to isolate
[SPEAKER_03]: and really really wanted to make this
perfect purple line which he's made a ton
[SPEAKER_03]: of them and I wanted to spread out a bunch
of different stuff and see what I like the
[SPEAKER_00]: most and things along that nature So do
you kind of limit yourself in any way in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sense that he does in regards to maybe
genetics like is there anything you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to use or anything you feel you
Definitely have to use type thing or is it
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of you don't limit yourself like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Definitely like using or starting from
older genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really Like the whole pop a pack
of seeds find a male and make work from it
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really really like my chocolate
cherry because it was a chocolate time is
[SPEAKER_03]: Really like the red line because it is my
baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like the rainbow because I've
worked All these lines to get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am going to start isolating myself
for a while Pushing the rainbow line
[SPEAKER_03]: pushing the red vine line and bringing the
chocolate cherry back But will I ever just
[SPEAKER_03]: like say these are the only things I'm
gonna work.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I find So much beauty and so many of
the plants that I don't think I could ever
[SPEAKER_03]: just isolate myself to that a specific
strain and Just do those ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like too many plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see like I was saying earlier I can
see commercial brick flowers and I can
[SPEAKER_03]: find things in it that I Think are cool or
nice or I can find some guy who's never
[SPEAKER_03]: grown before is outdoor and be all like oh
man it has like this certain smell of Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a structure or hey, it didn't have
bugs attack it, you know, just stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would never Just isolate myself
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like I like to fiddle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Like OCD ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really am all over the place at times
So the chocolate tie, sorry the What was
[SPEAKER_00]: it the cherry chocolate tie that's come up
a few times so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to give us the backstory on
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's pretty interesting It's the
revs cherry tie I Absolutely loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's tons of information out there on
the revs cherry tie and it was a chocolate
[SPEAKER_03]: tie female that I Came across that I just
had to do something with It was the only
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that I had personally saying that
tasted like milk chocolate Like it truly
[SPEAKER_03]: tasted like chocolate not like hints of
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tasted like actual chocolate so when I
had it and then I had a revs cherry tie,
[SPEAKER_03]: which she just sent me a Sent us a ton
more beans up so I can further the work
[SPEAKER_03]: with it It just worked so well together
and it's like tie on tie on tie So I had
[SPEAKER_03]: to I it was like something I had to do to
bring myself like a Tie to work tied seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: to pop and to go through to find these
perfect ties strings So what was the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of creating rainbow like for
people who aren't aware the lineage is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's that tie You just mentioned cross to
their GKB and then you got that hybrid and
[SPEAKER_00]: cross that to the TK How did this whole
process take place?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, was it over a few years was each
step just obvious like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: explain the genesis of it for us Okay,
I started the chocolate cherry Was before
[SPEAKER_03]: my daughter was born my time my time
frames are never great so we'll say
[SPEAKER_03]: between she'll be eight now, so it's over
eight years ago and So that's when I
[SPEAKER_03]: started with the chocolate cherry and
after I made chocolate cherry I actually
[SPEAKER_03]: was going through it and finding females.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't really looking for a male and
Then I started working with my brother had
[SPEAKER_03]: given me these lavender cross seeds and I
was going through a ton of colon issues of
[SPEAKER_03]: the cancer in my colon and other random
things So the lavender was really really
[SPEAKER_03]: helping me So I started working with that
boy and my chocolate cherry Mills were
[SPEAKER_03]: just put on the back burner and I started
working with the lavender and Tripoli
[SPEAKER_03]: wicked and I hit the chocolate cherry with
it and I hit a tie with it and things
[SPEAKER_03]: along that line but I ended up going back
to the chocolate cherry and finding a male
[SPEAKER_03]: that was Really tie dominant and had that
cherry smell instead of the chocolates,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they actually had a cherry smell
in the stem rub The mom Tasted like
[SPEAKER_03]: chocolates and cherries.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I call it that it tastes like
chocolates and cherries, which was amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: I call from that and hit triangle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I became obsessed with triangle as an og
It was just like the perfect og for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grew great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it to yield It was super potent for
me and always he's helped me at the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: the night to come out of my thoughts and
bring me down because I Used to be really
[SPEAKER_03]: high strong still high strong,
but I used to be really really high strong
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I made that cross the triangle
female with the chocolate cherry male One
[SPEAKER_03]: of the first seeds I actually popped Came
out a plant that smelled like the
[SPEAKER_03]: licorice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smelled like candy like red vine candy
and I was uh Making some calls and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: like I swear it smells just like red vine
candy You have to try it knows shown to a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of my my really close friends
locally and they were like do tape Really
[SPEAKER_03]: smells and tastes like red vine candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll just call it red vine kush and
that name stuck with it forever So when I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't ever think so when I decided to
work with a male out of the red vine seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: The best way for me to say it was it's a
red vine male which Red vine was really in
[SPEAKER_03]: my eyes that single female that I had
found because it smelled just like the
[SPEAKER_03]: candy But how else could I really relay
that message to people that it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was this by this by this instead?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just all it's my red vine male and I
took the red vine male to the OJKB and the
[SPEAKER_03]: very first seed I popped Was what ended up
becoming known as rainbow SSOG because my
[SPEAKER_03]: daughter named it she was huge and my
little ponies and that's how all that
[SPEAKER_03]: whole thing snowballed into it all the
ponies and on the seed packaging and all
[SPEAKER_03]: the names and everything like that was
really at the time I like five-year-old
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah Yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You banged out a few answers for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna ask for the people wondering
why all your strains are named after my
[SPEAKER_00]: little pony The other thing I wanted to
ask is you use the TK and you kind of set
[SPEAKER_00]: it in there, you know You really liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's the best of all the OGs?
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, do you think it's
the original or is something else the
[SPEAKER_00]: original in your mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: the TK for me I Truly believe that so much
California Flowers were going back east
[SPEAKER_03]: and things like that that a lot of seeds
were being popped from bag seeds And
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it came from bag seeds or not,
it's beyond me But I had OGs like TK in
[SPEAKER_03]: California and that's why I loved it It
reminded me so much of these green strains
[SPEAKER_03]: that we were getting out of San Diego then
we had a strain that we Called San Diego I
[SPEAKER_03]: think it was San Diego something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember the name of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was just referred to as that
really good pot San Diego and So that's I
[SPEAKER_03]: could never acquire that it was forever
before I got a cut back of what we called
[SPEAKER_03]: the San Diego Cut and now it was the San
Diego OG later and it reminds me so much
[SPEAKER_03]: of TK Well, I end up getting TK reminded
me completely of the San Diego Plant and
[SPEAKER_03]: now I have the San Diego plant and they
are a lot of like they have some unique
[SPEAKER_03]: differences But they're very very small
unique differences and they could be
[SPEAKER_03]: because they've been in completely two
different environments for so long But
[SPEAKER_03]: they've just evolved over time and that's
why I was obsessed with the TK for so long
[SPEAKER_03]: because I had this flower and it was
coming through quite often and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking on it for like a year straight and
I could never get a cut of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but when I seen TK, I was all holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That reminds me spot-on of the San Diego
flow Yeah, okay, so yeah, it's hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: back home from when you were younger
Exactly So for people who have kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: taken a glance at the current range most
notably within the rainbow offering We can
[SPEAKER_00]: see that a lot of the mothers you've
chosen to pair with it outside of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: your own creations and things like the
dosey dough gelato Skittles things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that Do you think that rainbow itself
pairs well with these other kind of I just
[SPEAKER_00]: broadly speaking I guess you'd say that
you like the dessert type of strains Do
[SPEAKER_00]: you think it pairs well with that like
going like keeping sweet cookie things to
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet cookie things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what do you think it crosses really
well to yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: The mill from that line that I chose is
extremely dominant like everything was
[SPEAKER_03]: looking rainbow like and that chocolate
smell and flavor is really pushing into
[SPEAKER_03]: everything even The skittles like it's
hard to find a Plant in that cross that
[SPEAKER_03]: smells like skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is like chocolate funk
chocolate funk funk funk chocolate funk so
[SPEAKER_03]: And they hit anything with the rainbow
mail that I chose and it's going to push
[SPEAKER_03]: What I want I it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like downplaying some of
my crosses That I'm saying that the mail
[SPEAKER_03]: will overpower everything but with each
female there are some variances whether
[SPEAKER_03]: it's structure or yields or you will find
different smells with different females
[SPEAKER_03]: and I Ran a lot of these plants and these
are some of the ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually really liked the skittles one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Surprised that it has been so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was surprised when I first ran them all
outdoors I usually do all my testing my
[SPEAKER_03]: initial testing and Outdoors in large
groups that way I can do a mass test Under
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty good conditions because we have
fluctuations here where I live.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it gets up to 112 115 Fahrenheit
and they can bottom down into the 40s at
[SPEAKER_03]: night So it would put them through a lot
of stress So when I was going through my
[SPEAKER_03]: initial testing and I ran 20 ish of
everything and the Skittles were coming
[SPEAKER_03]: out absolutely phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was no way I couldn't produce or
put them out The Mendo breath to me was
[SPEAKER_03]: more along the lines of grabbing the OG KB
from it and OG KB from rainbow and seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: what I could do on that end and Then the
same with the dosy though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has the OG KB Rainbow has the OG KB and
I wanted to see what those two would play
[SPEAKER_03]: together Plus I had OG KB with rainbow as
well So you can kind of see what I was
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to do with that grouping to see
where I could go Later down the line is
[SPEAKER_03]: like will I take that rainbow by dosy doe?
[SPEAKER_03]: back to a dosy doe or back to the rainbow
with mills if I ever chose to The easy one
[SPEAKER_03]: that was sort of like back crossing the
red line for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Did the chocolate cherry as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: I never really That one's really
interesting Because it's so Thai dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not for most growers I'm getting
plants that were taken, you know four
[SPEAKER_03]: months to finish and a lot of people don't
really care for that Yeah, and then I did
[SPEAKER_03]: some with a with the gold strain the
Acapulco gold I can't release that one
[SPEAKER_03]: because the person who gave me that cut
asked me not to release it and that I
[SPEAKER_03]: won't and I did a Panama Cross with it
that I won't release because once again
[SPEAKER_03]: the same person who gave me the gold cut
Asked me told me I could work with it but
[SPEAKER_03]: asked me not to release them because
that's there his babies and he's an older
[SPEAKER_03]: guy and He'll pass them on to me when he's
ready to do What I what I really would
[SPEAKER_03]: like to do and let people have some real
old-school genetics But yeah, I just think
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of those crosses really weird that
that's what the market was hungry for They
[SPEAKER_03]: like those plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They like the gelados and they like the
cookies those things but so I wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: give people what they wanted but I Wanted
to do it with the rainbow because the
[SPEAKER_03]: rainbow really is a unique plant and it
kind of overtakes everything so you can
[SPEAKER_03]: still have your name with the gelato,
but It'll have mice my footprint my stamp
[SPEAKER_03]: on there with the rainbow pushing it to a
different level Yeah, good answer So just
[SPEAKER_00]: given your you know experience and history
with all of these various cuts We've just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of mentioned out of all the kind of
dessert cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite one?
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, what's the most
overrated one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now I got a cut of acai and
surprisingly it is special and unique The
[SPEAKER_03]: flip favor the terpene profile is this
Raspberry blueberry a creamy thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I it's I've just barely grown it for the
first time and I gotta say I'm impressed
[SPEAKER_03]: like I haven't been impressed with any of
the cookies Truly thing is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was all whoa, whoever made this
they they took the flavor town to a
[SPEAKER_03]: different level I also really like animal
cookies because it breeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like I don't know why my uncle I
have an uncle who's on hospice right now
[SPEAKER_03]: and I would grow animal cookies a lot and
it's my dad's brother and I would grow
[SPEAKER_03]: animal cookies specifically for him He
called him animal crackers and he would
[SPEAKER_03]: send my hand over to the house and be all
he called me Bubba That's why I use Bubba
[SPEAKER_03]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been called Bubba my whole life And
he would tell me ask Bubba if he got any
[SPEAKER_03]: more of those Girl Scout animal crackers
like the animal crackers the cookies that
[SPEAKER_03]: it would just tumble on the It was
something new every time So he called it
[SPEAKER_03]: these names is something different every
time but he absolutely loved it out of
[SPEAKER_03]: every strain I grew he never he hasn't got
a smoke rainbow because he's been sick for
[SPEAKER_03]: a few years And he said some of the
rainbow concentrates and I make a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: rosin and I turn into coconut oil so I can
give it to him that way but for all the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants that I he had like something about
the animal Cookies was crazy for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He loved so that one's really special to
me the past few years now the one that's
[SPEAKER_03]: the most overrated Now there's so many
gelato cuts Floating around and I went
[SPEAKER_03]: through probably seven or eight that were
terrible that were I mean I don't even
[SPEAKER_03]: know why people would have grown them and
then mothered them and then kept them in
[SPEAKER_03]: clone form to pass them out they were They
weren't they shouldn't have never even
[SPEAKER_03]: kept or grown So those ones are pretty
brutal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the gelato is just pretty brutal
the one I found at least looks like OG KB
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't have the gelato nose that
everyone talks about but I would say that
[SPEAKER_03]: was probably be the one that's not the
best What was the name of the the first
[SPEAKER_00]: strain you said the raspberry and
blueberry one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, no we did get the name I just was
like what the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I thought the audio cut out I was
like he said something but all I heard was
[SPEAKER_01]: like a and e or something I Might be
pronouncing this wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a ca I and it I I realized that it's
a berry I want to say like the South
[SPEAKER_03]: America I know they have a drink flavored.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're a side as I eat something
along those lines Yeah, I've heard of that
[SPEAKER_00]: one my bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay that yeah, I think I may have even
seen a photo or two or just something
[SPEAKER_00]: along those lines on Instagram if that one
that seems like that's my those guys from
[SPEAKER_00]: Compound genetics or whatever might be
playing with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Who knows Pinky pie is collab
between you and Matt which I thought it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of flew under the radar a bit as far
as I could tell I don't know but what was
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting was that It's it's kind of
like it's the cookie berry diesel across
[SPEAKER_00]: to the rainbow Obviously probably gonna be
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question for me was do you plan to
do any more collabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we do I met with him today He's an
amazing guy, but I met up with them today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked It's fun a ton of fun sounded
about what we're doing We are doing this
[SPEAKER_03]: whole this wouldn't be considered like
what most people would consider a collab
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're working this huge bubblegum line
thing right now And we're trying to really
[SPEAKER_03]: really isolate those terpenes To make sure
the seats tastes like so like if you get a
[SPEAKER_03]: pack of the bubblegum seeds You're going
to get pink bubblegum knots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's a sweet but that's that's not
really a collab per se I'm getting his
[SPEAKER_03]: riot berry OG and we're doing it with a
rainbow and that one's gonna be really rad
[SPEAKER_03]: and then He did some work with chocolate
and so we're gonna do my chocolate
[SPEAKER_03]: chocolate rainbow male with His chocolate
females, but then he gave me his
[SPEAKER_03]: chocolates high male and we're gonna take
that to my chocolate Super chocolate
[SPEAKER_03]: rainbow female So those are some of the
collabs that we spoke of today and we have
[SPEAKER_03]: a few other things that There's funny when
we're talking he's only good, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's try not to say these out to people
yet For for reasons that he has and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: all I you know, so I I'm good with that
Yeah, okay So I guess you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's interesting a lot of our fans they
loved the polarizing nature of Matt Had
[SPEAKER_00]: your first medium and you had you kind of
I think you even said it to me in person
[SPEAKER_00]: you kind of attribute a bit of the success
of rainbow to in terms of like Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: helping you to kind of Where how shall we
say like promote it to the public a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more because there's a lot of stuff which
goes under the radar because you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: public Just don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did how'd you meet man?
[SPEAKER_00]: How that all come about?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually funny I have a friend over
in San Luis and he had Matt's 26 cookies
[SPEAKER_03]: cut it like so 28 or 26.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget this every damn time but anyways,
he had this cut of Matt's and He was look
[SPEAKER_03]: he was looking to reacquire his his
cookies cut a friend of mine had it So I
[SPEAKER_03]: had reached out to Matt and told him hey
my buddy has that cookies that you were
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for He told me he was gonna get it
to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna be heading down your way if you
want to meet up Well, he ended up getting
[SPEAKER_03]: it back before that but we just started to
Conversate text message, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then pretty much we talked started
talking every day and then we started
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about genetics and then I would
show him this vast array of crazy shit
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made over the years and He showed me
all the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd been making over the years and he'd
be like, hey, how come you don't sell
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have amazing skill.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have amazing growing skill.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you know sell seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just I don't like it's never been
something I wanted to do I made these for
[SPEAKER_03]: myself I made these to find things for me
and he's thought but people it wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: Really about money and I'll explain this
in a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was never about money for Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was all people Would want to see these
people wanted people would love to see
[SPEAKER_03]: this people want to see your work and he
after he went over two years you can ask
[SPEAKER_03]: him he Asked me for over two years to sell
seeds and I finally agreed with the
[SPEAKER_03]: rainbow the rainbow who's so special I was
all like dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember telling them one day as a
man I really think that maybe we should
[SPEAKER_03]: put it out there people are getting the
smoke it and they're all this is like
[SPEAKER_03]: 1990s on you know on Big big big things
like it's all this reminds me of
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is so nostalgic for me, it's Like
they couldn't put their finger on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the what I was hearing So I
talked to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He he talked me into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's all like let me put these let me sell
these seeds for you And let me help you
[SPEAKER_03]: with this and then I was okay and he was I
don't want any money He didn't want a
[SPEAKER_03]: dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't take a dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was I'll put him on my website.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll put him up I'm gonna talk about it
because I They helped him so much and they
[SPEAKER_03]: helped his uh his significant others so
much with their anxieties and their their
[SPEAKER_03]: their feelings that they were having and
she will have some Medical issues and they
[SPEAKER_03]: they helped her with those things and
that's what I saw I made this for myself
[SPEAKER_03]: because of my own health issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: So That's really how our friendship
started.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was over talking about genetics and
cookies Cloning he was trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: reacquire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's truly it That's an awesome story so
something you just touched on which I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: love to delve more into is kind of the
aspect of medicinal value within breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: is this something which to you is just
like it's kind of cool if it's there but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not a specific goal or are you always
kind of medically minded in that regard as
[SPEAKER_03]: far as a breeder I'm always gonna breed
for myself and first and my real passion
[SPEAKER_03]: projects They really are pushing the
medical parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember being on I didn't go to forums
mad was always trying to get me to go on
[SPEAKER_03]: forums and I said man I'm always out in
the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really have time for the forums.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always growing I'm always growing I'd
go on there a few times and I would
[SPEAKER_03]: explain to people about how this strain
helped with this or I couldn't Live
[SPEAKER_03]: without the strain and people would think
it was some sort of joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all oh, yeah, was it miracle weed
as all you called it weed So you probably
[SPEAKER_03]: don't really love the plant like I do So I
would Push that medical benefit as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: I possibly can and it goes back to the the
chocolate cherry Making me feel like I was
[SPEAKER_03]: on the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I didn't like that feeling but I
could feel the other parts of it and how
[SPEAKER_03]: important they would be to help relax my
body and help calm me and I get a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: pain sometimes and I need things that are
extremely strong and I don't Like to be
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely high and so I have to find that
that area that gray area where My head is
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, but my body's completely blown out
where it's just like relaxed beyond all
[SPEAKER_03]: belief.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes The medical part is priority a one
for me, but I love breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love making crosses with genetics
For other people as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's some strains that I really
want to work with Whether they have any
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of benefit or not I would work with
them if I felt like these two plants
[SPEAKER_03]: together would make Magic, so I would
still work with things Regardless of
[SPEAKER_03]: whether they're medical or not But I
personally for my own breeding I want them
[SPEAKER_00]: to have certain aspects So recently we saw
the rainbow SS OGs F2 go to auction
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously kind of one of your hallmark
strains at this point You got to be pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: stoked that you know cracked like the 2k
mark because you know I mean the proofs in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pudding right the demands there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel though about the fact that
in some ways it could be the next star
[SPEAKER_00]: fighter, you know, like do you How would
you feel if someone starts a company off
[SPEAKER_00]: that pack type of thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I There was a battle.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a battle that I had before I even
released that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a battle I had on All my crosses
like well, what if somebody took my work
[SPEAKER_03]: and what if somebody made this or what if
they made that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I should be really proud if somebody
finds something so special that they could
[SPEAKER_03]: get that type of a plant out of and make
an entire company and thrive With it and
[SPEAKER_03]: make a living for them and their family.
[SPEAKER_03]: How special should I feel?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean if something I did affected
somebody else that affects their family
[SPEAKER_03]: that affects somebody else that would feel
amazing I would have zero jealousy zero
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course, I hope the person who bought
the f2s find something absolutely stunning
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they do some amazing stuff with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a purpose why I auctioned that I
had somebody who needed something so I
[SPEAKER_03]: auctioned that off I did two auctions and
I gave them a half a Everything so they
[SPEAKER_03]: could Pay some pay some bills So I thought
in my mind those two crosses that I
[SPEAKER_03]: auctioned were the ones that would bring
in the most in Lord, I think brought like
[SPEAKER_03]: $2,000 I was I was tickled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't believe it So it was it was
really really really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's proud For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean testament to the quality of the
work, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I put a lot of time rainbow and I'm
Proud to see that people will see it and
[SPEAKER_00]: and truly put their faith behind my work
So on a kind of you know that vein What is
[SPEAKER_00]: the next kind of strain you want to
incorporate into a breeding pool that you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't done?
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I guess as an extension of that,
what do you think will be the next big
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to kind of take the scene?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the my next work is uh I'm doing
rainbow again, but i'm going i'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: go into a little different direction with
um I'm going to isolate the chocolate
[SPEAKER_03]: females and the chocolate male and i'm
going to push the chocolate terpenes into
[SPEAKER_03]: seed form and rainbow f2 chocolate female
with the with the male So i'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: make some f2 so that rainbow line and
that's super chocolate then i'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: do the f3 with uh with the original
rainbow and then uh Some more
[SPEAKER_03]: back-crossing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where i'm headed right now on my
little personal project.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's building I don't know the
scene where it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep thinking that we're going to leave
the cookie and um That people will stop
[SPEAKER_03]: working with it and there will be
something else But I think how deep that
[SPEAKER_03]: plant Got into modern genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we could ever truly get
away from it everything has that that look
[SPEAKER_03]: To it now and everything has either cookie
name or dessert name or something along
[SPEAKER_03]: those lines So it'd be like erasing our
modern history.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just I don't think it's going to happen
I'm hoping that guys start resetting start
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at it different and it comes down
to the breeders To start working with some
[SPEAKER_03]: old hazes and trying to find some old
skunks and not the lies Don't like say
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're working with a haze or a skunk
and have it be some weird Indica looking
[SPEAKER_03]: like really really do your work pop seeds
find that special plant and go from there
[SPEAKER_03]: and work it because it would be nice to
have that old school feel again,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, you can put a modern twist
on it and everything like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm hoping i'm seeing it so much right
now, uh guys claiming that they're you
[SPEAKER_03]: know using a 1960 skunk or uh these all
these hazes, uh The columbian blacks and
[SPEAKER_03]: things along that line and it's hard for
me to believe Because I haven't seen those
[SPEAKER_03]: strains in a very very long time and i've
never seen a skunk from the 60s But i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: hoping that there are some of those
treasure troves to still be opened and
[SPEAKER_03]: people can still come out i've been
meeting some people lately i've been
[SPEAKER_03]: helping a lot of Older people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean friday night before I took my wife
out to dinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: I stopped at a vietnam vets house and Gave
him some medicine to so he could get
[SPEAKER_03]: through the night He up and said he didn't
have anything and he was close.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a family friend So I drove him over a
bunch of stuff and he has seeds from when
[SPEAKER_03]: he went to vietnam And he's gone offered
me these seeds and I have no clue what
[SPEAKER_03]: they are But to have that offer there
there is other seeds out there I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to pop some of my father's old
michoacan that I found in the envelope
[SPEAKER_03]: from when he was in prison With his little
prisoner id and his return address and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything And these seeds are in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I found them in my garage I
guess they followed us through like three
[SPEAKER_03]: moves when I found them and i've tried to
pop there was 27 28 and I have failed
[SPEAKER_03]: miserably over and over so the last six
i've kept and i'm hoping that one day
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody can extract some dna out of it or
something so I can see these Plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's where I hope our industry goes
Okay, and so Would you ever consider doing
[SPEAKER_00]: what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be considered kind of like a
consumer demand strain like for example if
[SPEAKER_00]: if there was enough demand for you to do
like a Gorilla glue rainbow hybrid would
[SPEAKER_00]: you do it to meet that demand or is it
very much like?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to want the cross to happen on a
personal note You know I will meet the
[SPEAKER_03]: demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I truly will I I did a lot of those in
the last process Like I was saying so many
[SPEAKER_03]: people want gelato.
[SPEAKER_03]: I truly didn't want to work with the
gelato.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy I did it came out pure chocolate
and coffee I actually did a gorilla glue
[SPEAKER_03]: cross with rainbow, but I did it for a
local friend And um, I gifted him a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't release those seeds though I
actually have a ton of them that I didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: release to other people locally Or friends
from here, and they're asked for I made
[SPEAKER_03]: the crosses for them specifically and
gifted them some so I'm open to make
[SPEAKER_03]: anything as long as I Don't hate the plant
like or something Hates too strong of a
[SPEAKER_03]: word I apologize I shouldn't use that as
long as I don't dislike the plant or as
[SPEAKER_03]: long as the plant doesn't have some sort
of reputation or as long as a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't have like don't share this plant
with anybody and Don't do this with the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and those kind of plants I I tried
to steer clear from because I don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: to rub anybody wrong by working with
something that I shouldn't have worked
[SPEAKER_03]: with or things along that nature,
but I am willing to Work with anything I
[SPEAKER_03]: see that I find has potential or
specialness or a unique uniqueness Yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: the next source of uniqueness will come
from and the reason why I asked this is
[SPEAKER_00]: because Increasingly I see This kind of
trend where some of the old-school
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that are widely regarded as
really unique You know the Colombians the
[SPEAKER_00]: ties things like that are being caught are
being incorporated into the modern
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and the perfect example is both
the rainbow SS Which has obviously got
[SPEAKER_00]: some tie or even if you look at another
trending strain at the moment Mac by
[SPEAKER_00]: Capuleta Which has the land race Colombian
in it both of these strains were I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: just as a side note that I tried both of
those at the Emerald Cup and those were
[SPEAKER_00]: the two I actually enjoyed the most and I
kind of thought This could be kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: jazzing up the what's regarded as the
stale polyhybrid Do you think that is like
[SPEAKER_00]: a reasonable formula going ahead in the
future like incorporating some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: old-school stuff into the modern stuff and
trying to Yeah, just um spice everything
[SPEAKER_03]: up I believe Capulator had corrected
himself and said the Mac doesn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombian in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh bum bum bum It's an alien orange cookie
cross but what I would Eluding to what I
[SPEAKER_03]: was saying earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Think we're going to start seeing in
this more We're going to start seeing this
[SPEAKER_03]: come out more where guys are finding the
older strains and putting them with the
[SPEAKER_03]: newer strains and kind of resetting the
plant you still get some of the Before it
[SPEAKER_03]: was watering down effects, but some of the
look and of the new stuff but maybe it
[SPEAKER_03]: improves the yield because some of these
cookies that have Rabbit-herd buds and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're getting a pound of light or
something like people just don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: do that people the electricity cost or
skyrocketing and Production cost of
[SPEAKER_03]: skyrocketing so you do need to get Some
yield and looking back at all the strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: They yielded really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were big.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were aggressive They weren't
susceptible to PM and the bugs didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: destroy them like they do now and things
along that nature, but no I where Mac I
[SPEAKER_03]: could be speaking wrong on that but like
it was said that it had Colombian in it
[SPEAKER_03]: rainbow is as And you're seeing a few
other things that are people the good
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders or the the breeders I should even
say good breeders breeders Are saying like
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, I'm working with this older IBM or I'm
working with this land race type or I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: working with these genetics that are from
Thailand or from South America I would
[SPEAKER_03]: love to see a breeder Pull the Micho Khan
back out and work with that or pull the
[SPEAKER_03]: old gold strings out and work with that
They were absolutely flawless and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: why it was important for me to try to get
these Micho's to Micho constant To come to
[SPEAKER_03]: life to rejuvenate, but they went through
so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be hard some of them look
like Fossilized like they're actually
[SPEAKER_03]: glass on the inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's gonna be rough.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's I do I truly think that that's
where we're gonna be Headed because if you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't go and pull some of the old stuff
back into it Everything's gonna become
[SPEAKER_03]: like our table apples that have no flavor
and they're just shiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty shy flavorless or flavorless
fruit Yeah, okay, that's that's cool to
[SPEAKER_00]: know about the Mac thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I wonder if he's gonna change the
name to mock No, just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a question our listeners love for me
to ask is when you are popping these old
[SPEAKER_00]: school Seeds, what are some of your tips
help getting them to work?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't go straight to the the
chemicals I'll try to do a scuffing first
[SPEAKER_03]: these new seed crackers are Freaking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a little screw on them and it
slowly tightens down on the seed till it
[SPEAKER_03]: just sort of starts to open the shell I
also like to put them in high humidity if
[SPEAKER_03]: they've been dry so that way hopefully
They can pull in some more of the
[SPEAKER_03]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Personally put them through a cold
cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll either put them in the fridge or the
freezer until they Fully dormant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll bring them out and then act like
spring is here I try to fool them as best
[SPEAKER_03]: as I can and worst-case scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll use the ga3 and Take deal with the
stretch and the craziness to just try to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it to Come back to life And so I've
actually only ever used the ga3 once in an
[SPEAKER_00]: attempt to get some old Tom Hill stock to
pop Unfortunately didn't really work out
[SPEAKER_00]: for me But I went into it knowing like
what you referenced that the the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: would be hard to kind of manage it first
When you have done that, what was the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience like growing those plants out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they like crazy stretchy and you just
had to you know Take a clone of a clone
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it kind of settled down or was it
much less pronounced than that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone that I've actually used it on has
Been pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would fly right out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would stretch really really really
fast so one way I would do that is that I
[SPEAKER_03]: made these a PVC tube and I would fill it
up with a About halfway with there and
[SPEAKER_03]: then I would drop the seedling in there
and I would put an LED right above the
[SPEAKER_03]: tube and as the seed Chased the light and
elongated and got long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would bury it in dirt up the stem
because that's what it was Wanted to do
[SPEAKER_03]: was grow in the very elongated stem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would just bury it in dirt as it went
up and it would Eventually slow down to
[SPEAKER_03]: the point where I can top it branch it
take some clones root them and usually the
[SPEAKER_03]: clones Were already okay once they got
roots And you slow them down the first
[SPEAKER_03]: generational clone off of that Space
attack plant was it was okay Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know so The final question
on the old seeds with all of this being
[SPEAKER_00]: said, what's the oldest one you've been
able to pop?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man Recently I popped some since he
star or from 95 Those that was a pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: good cheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were pretty white And pretty beat up
I popped some of my dad's stuff at other
[SPEAKER_03]: times that I'm assuming were from the 80s
Maybe early 90s all commercial stuff And
[SPEAKER_03]: other than that I've felled on some of the
really old stuff a lot and it's driving me
[SPEAKER_03]: nuts So I'm thinking of other ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that we can get some of these
seeds to be I Don't know how they'll do
[SPEAKER_03]: it, but I'm hearing of DNA and pulling out
sales from plant and basically doing that
[SPEAKER_03]: What they're doing those lab clones now,
but with the DNA from the seedling Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's interesting that stuff I haven't
looked into it too much myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think it's probably cost-prohibitive
Yeah These seeds are super important.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've been looking into it because I I
really really really would like to see one
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important it's special to me,
you know Yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So When you are popping some seeds,
how many do you like to pop at a time?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when you're doing a phenohunt or
Just maybe even say testing a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you feel is a good number to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm phenohunting for To check for
stability I like to do as many as
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I did 200 ish Last summer and then
followed that with my fall greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did another hundred and then the next
spring I did Another 50 to 100 and then I
[SPEAKER_03]: grew plenty on the inside of the house as
well So stability you have to see a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to see a lot, especially if
you make a huge says with 10 or 15
[SPEAKER_03]: different moms now when I'm looking for a
male I Like to do less where I'll do 10 to
[SPEAKER_03]: 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe even 20 seeds I'll take my females.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll flower now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I take clones off of them and
then I look at the mills and If I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: see anything I like Pop more if I see one
that I like I'll keep them to the side and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll pop another set of the 10 15 or 20
and I'll find another male and from those
[SPEAKER_03]: if I like them and He goes and I usually
do it one more time and then I'll narrow
[SPEAKER_03]: it down to those three males and I'll put
them through their entire pace And see
[SPEAKER_03]: which one I like as it goes Yeah,
awesome at a time I don't like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't like to see a ton because by
the time I looked at a mom getting
[SPEAKER_03]: Irritated or I feel that maybe I'm looking
too fast or I'm grinding through it So I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to see a small I'll pick the best
small scale pick the best small scale pick
[SPEAKER_03]: the best and then isolate those three that
I'm looking forward to find that single
[SPEAKER_00]: plant Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in regards to the male selection,
you know, you just went over a fair bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Some of the things you like to do
to help you select males This is a big
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get asked a lot But you know,
I think to be honest with we've had enough
[SPEAKER_00]: guests talk about just you know generic
like stem rubs and stuff So maybe let's
[SPEAKER_00]: make it a little more interesting Do you
like to put your males through the ringer
[SPEAKER_00]: give them like a good stress test?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the first thing I won't use the male
that flowers on I Have nails that are over
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 years old And that constantly I keep
almost every male I've ever used So that's
[SPEAKER_03]: one of my keys is to keep my meals.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can't fly our under 24 hours of light
He has to be just like my girls where he
[SPEAKER_03]: can stay in there and then eventually I
take a clone off of him and he gets
[SPEAKER_03]: Mulched and the clone becomes the new dad
for in case I ever want to work with him
[SPEAKER_03]: again I like to look for structure of the
plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know everyone says that so I like to
look at the Leaf if I'm looking for a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain female that has a narrow leaf,
I'll look for that in the in the mail I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: look for my narrow leaves or things along
that and then I always flower them out
[SPEAKER_03]: even if I'm not going to utilize his
pollen I'll flower out my nails just so I
[SPEAKER_03]: can see what His male flowers look like
how long it takes him to drop pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: When does he stop dropping pollen?
[SPEAKER_03]: When does his male flowers die?
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole the whole from start to finish
the his whole life And I'll go from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually flowers that I didn't end up
using because I didn't like how Long it
[SPEAKER_03]: took them to flower or and then not drop
enough pollen I've had males that had huge
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers and dropped so little pollen and I
didn't use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did it really matter?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know because I didn't use them But
it was something I didn't like seeing a
[SPEAKER_03]: male plant with thousands freaking little
flowers and no pollen was coming out Why
[SPEAKER_03]: you know is what's wrong with him?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Those are all things I look for Yeah,
that's that's a good answer out of
[SPEAKER_00]: curiosity What do you think it correlates
to in a male if you've got a male that
[SPEAKER_00]: takes quite a while to drop pollen Do you
know what that correlates to in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know That's like a bad sign
because it means the offspring will show
[SPEAKER_00]: blur traits Or do you think it's just like
it's just one of those things in general
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're like, look I don't I don't
know but just you don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell I Actually think it would just
show that it would be a slower flowering
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah So like it would take longer to get
going in the flower or probably longer to
[SPEAKER_03]: finish and flower To keep my plants in
that unless I'm working my sativa lines if
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm working my hybrids I like to keep them
in the 60 to 70 Dayframe a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to work a hybrid, you know
three months and things like that So but
[SPEAKER_03]: that's one thing I do notice that I like a
plant to come out of the gate Show me what
[SPEAKER_03]: she's gonna do Not be finicky throughout
all those Kind of things so if I notice
[SPEAKER_03]: that the the mom isn't finicky at the
beginning of her flower She goes through
[SPEAKER_03]: her stage fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: She gets to her her flowering stage
quickly and she Goes from start to finish
[SPEAKER_03]: without a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can kind of see it from the mail I feed
my males the same as well when they're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to flower I feed them my flowering
routine and if he doesn't like it and he
[SPEAKER_03]: he is Doesn't like the food and he shows
burnt tips or if he takes a lot longer to
[SPEAKER_03]: progress or things like that It's just
it's not a perfect plant for in my eyes
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not something that I would think
would pass on well Whether I'm right or
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong in that it's really really difficult
for me to say because how do I know what
[SPEAKER_03]: those traits pass along as But in my my
brain that tells me okay He's slow to
[SPEAKER_03]: start dropping pollen or he's really fast
to start dropping pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a perfect Plant so I kind of like
it to start dropping this pollen,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know through the whole cycle He starts
building this flowers and this flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: grow and the plant stretches out It opens
up and then pollen starts to come out all
[SPEAKER_00]: around the same time So along that same
kind of school of thought What do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think about the distinction because this
is one I wanted to ask What do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: about the distinction because you
reference the you don't want them out of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower under 24-hour lights totally agree
What about though if it gets extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: root-bound because I've noticed Sometimes
males will flower because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: root-bound others.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just do it under 24-hour light
regardless and I thought do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually do you want to make the
distinction or not because maybe What I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm kind of getting at is maybe a
plant that flowers because it's root-bound
[SPEAKER_00]: is not as detrimental as say one that
flowers because it's under 24-7 would you
[SPEAKER_00]: agree with that or do you think like no no
matter what the Reasoning is if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering under 24-7 in a mother room,
like I'm not really interested No,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, I If I didn't do my job and I let him
get root-bound or cause that stress and he
[SPEAKER_03]: started flowering that's on me It's like I
I can look past it and if I can get him
[SPEAKER_03]: His normal routine is to be in my bucket
or his bag and he grows under there
[SPEAKER_03]: perfectly and Things along that nature and
doesn't flower and goes along But then
[SPEAKER_03]: this one certain time he got root-bound
and in flowers and drop pollen I Can kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of overlook that I will say this though
the rainbow male He's almost died like
[SPEAKER_03]: four times this I have clones of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just saying this So I have healthy
clones at all times of them, but I've let
[SPEAKER_03]: him completely dry out to where he was
weeping Dead and I'd give him water and he
[SPEAKER_03]: Still didn't flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that boy because he he flowers
under 1212 So there is boy plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: won't flower under stress There is boy
plants that will flower under stress,
[SPEAKER_03]: but not in normal conditions And then
there's boy plants that just like dropping
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen no matter what but if you stress a
plant enough you can cause adverse
[SPEAKER_03]: reactions and You got to kind of look past
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I in certain situations if you really like
that male So how many times have you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: done a project Made the pollination
growing out the seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously the male was good in your mind
That's why you selected and then it just
[SPEAKER_00]: turned out to be a dud for whatever reason
Is that rather uncommon like do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: with proper selection you can avoid that
or it's inevitable from time to time?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really picked too many bad males
per se Now I've made crosses that sucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made several That just were all men
and what I do and putting that thing in
[SPEAKER_03]: there So I've had crosses that were duds,
but I've never I know I can honestly say
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never picked him now that just across
the board sucked I usually only try to
[SPEAKER_03]: work with what I feel is the best of the
best genetics wise and Planet wise is with
[SPEAKER_03]: research and growing out and checking lots
of different females of the stuff And I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty lucky in that aspect where I
haven't put Down the duds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did do a son And I went and call them
duds because we grew the hell out of it
[SPEAKER_03]: outside, but I didn't get a single Skunky
nose on one plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was super piney and super dank,
but nothing got a skunk nose And I was
[SPEAKER_03]: really depressed later on I did a project
and got the skunk nose to come out But I
[SPEAKER_03]: felt like a failure For not getting the
skunk in my first crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that cross?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we lost the audio for a second
there Oh, it was uh, yeah, it was just a
[SPEAKER_03]: older an older skunk to Skunk number one
clone that I was gifted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some skunk supposedly skunk seeds
and I went through them and I Found that
[SPEAKER_03]: roadkill smell was prevalent in these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked a male and in bed she smelled
super And my female was pure skunk and I
[SPEAKER_03]: put them together and those first seeds
Did not smell like skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it again with a different male And I
got a lot of skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my male just he tricked me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't throw down the skunk smells that
I had planned That's interesting I we've
[SPEAKER_00]: spoken to a few breeders about this kind
of quest for the roadkill skunk A lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are kind of renewing it now Do you
think it's possible for it to come back
[SPEAKER_00]: and more importantly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that when people talk about
the roadkill skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're referring to the same strain or do
you think the roadkill skunk is a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man I truly think that it's a bunch of
different strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there's a true Okay,
so I think when we're younger our senses
[SPEAKER_03]: are a lot More open and I think that we
get confused Now we're more our palates
[SPEAKER_03]: are more refined with our cannabis smells
we've been smoking it and smelling
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis forever But when we're younger a
lot of things just smell bad like oh my
[SPEAKER_03]: god, that's stinky.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells like a skunk But there are truly
strains of smell Like actual skunk like a
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk sprayed and I myself would I go
fishing and I'm out like I'm pretty close
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in the country area.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I sell skunks all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're always out there They're
dropping their spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean my dad had a pet skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sprayed him in the face Long story
won't even get into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, I have a roadkill I was not
really called roadkill.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called skunk but it smells like A
dead skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it smells along those lines of roadkill
skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called skunk though excuse me,
it wasn't called roadkill skunk and I I
[SPEAKER_03]: think though like what you were alluding
to is the fact that there could be
[SPEAKER_03]: numerous offspring of these same genetic
pool plants that smell like a skunk and so
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people have a memory of a skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope more people work with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an amazing smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still an amazing smell I'll work with
it again eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a bunch of crosses I made years ago
with it and I've been giving them away
[SPEAKER_03]: freely for 12-13 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've sent off hundreds of packs of them
and no one ever grew them I don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: what they did with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might have just let them die and not
know what they actually had Hopefully not
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, hopefully not but when people get
stuff for free, they just don't cherish
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's free Yeah Yeah,
it's such a such a relevant point because
[SPEAKER_00]: it I mean, it's a pretty well-known
phenomena like it's even documented but
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you know people don't value what
they don't have to struggle for.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have to pay money for
something you're like, oh I think that was
[SPEAKER_03]: free.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've given away packs of seeds those
blueberry triangle I was making years ago
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was sending 100 packs or so to seed
vault and letting them give them away.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were finding some of the
best-looking cannabis I seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was insane and they would send me these
messages going, oh my god, can I get more
[SPEAKER_03]: of these?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you sell your seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really sell my seeds but I can
send you a few more packs but those things
[SPEAKER_03]: it was like blueberry buttery muffins with
the look of massive buds and then you'd
[SPEAKER_03]: get these blueberry triangle looking ones
with the blueberry smell just ruled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That blueberry muffin smell just carried
through on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last little thing on the roadkill skunk
some of the the common sentiment we heard
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed essentially is that maybe that
roadkill skunk is just it derives from
[SPEAKER_00]: landrace Afghani, you know like a
particularly acrid kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that is the case and is it
not kind of interesting that it's called
[SPEAKER_00]: roadkill skunk and it's like not a skunk
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like possibly just Afghani.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, it goes back to the days when
guys weren't really naming stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and finally that one just
smelled so much like dead skunks or a
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk spraying.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just called it skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know when skunk was coming around
California was getting a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghani type influx of strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it definitely would in my mind would
lean that way as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your what's your opinions on the
chem dog you ever want to breed with or
[SPEAKER_00]: you think it just doesn't gel with
rainbow?
[SPEAKER_03]: I chased a good chem cut for a very long
time because I just heard how amazing it
[SPEAKER_03]: was and how great it was and all these
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally got some cuts of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't the cuts I got when I first got
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know whether they were legit or
not weren't for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would I be open to seeing another version
of chem maybe one that was truly sure 100%
[SPEAKER_03]: chem or chem one or chem sis or chem four
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course I would any I mean, why wouldn't
I you know, you would be ignorant not to
[SPEAKER_03]: at least see this plant for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the ones I have grown that were
considered and called chem 91 the one I
[SPEAKER_03]: ran that was called chem sis they just
weren't for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it like what did you think of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just wasn't like like it wasn't
potent or it just wasn't like the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: high you enjoyed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it wasn't the type of the structure
of the plant the way it grew wasn't wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't my real I didn't mind the the
high and the one I had I actually enjoyed
[SPEAKER_03]: the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had like this acrid funk to it but the
it just wasn't my kind of plant and then
[SPEAKER_03]: the offspring I've seen come from a lot of
the chem dog has a high tendency to throw
[SPEAKER_03]: issues after breeding and it's something
with my Thai genetics that I have to take
[SPEAKER_03]: into serious considerations because Thai
isn't love doesn't love indoor growing
[SPEAKER_03]: like so it takes a soft hand and a lot of
us like to push nutrients and my plants
[SPEAKER_03]: don't need a lot of food a lot of the time
so I would think if I cross rainbow with
[SPEAKER_03]: chem dog and people had a next thing I
know people would be saying I bred Hermes
[SPEAKER_03]: and all these things and it's just
something I have to be very aware of but I
[SPEAKER_03]: chased a good chem dog for years and I
don't know maybe I just haven't got a good
[SPEAKER_03]: one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it's hard it can be hard to say I
mean this it's I think it's probably one
[SPEAKER_00]: of maybe that or sour diesel there's got
to be like one of the most like oh as you
[SPEAKER_00]: said gelato you know those guys have all
just got so many fake ones it can be hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell at times right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly like I didn't like sour diesel
until I finally had somebody say dude this
[SPEAKER_03]: is a real diesel cut try a flower this and
it was it was it was really good like I
[SPEAKER_03]: was all damn that's strong cannabis so and
I'm sad because I was going to meet up
[SPEAKER_03]: with I didn't realize that the Emerald Cup
I ran out of time but I believe if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: pea butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah yeah yeah yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had some chem dog and we talked
about it a month or so ago and he was a
[SPEAKER_03]: you could have came by the booth and tried
real chem and you could have guaranteed it
[SPEAKER_03]: would have been real chem so that makes me
sad because I could have tried for sure
[SPEAKER_03]: for sure real chem and made my opinion on
it at that point because I need to smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: it and I see his grows and I see his
flowers and they I want to try them yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: so we'll just leave it at that for now
because I can't talk about it because I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know if I have ever got a grow real
freaking chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and I understand I mean yeah pea butt
or skunk VA would definitely be the guys
[SPEAKER_00]: to see to get some really nice verifiable
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly and that's what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of touched on it with the
mentioning the tie and the tendencies it
[SPEAKER_00]: can sometimes have to herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that there are any types of
genetics which makes your tie more prone
[SPEAKER_00]: to hermy or is it more so as you referred
to the way in which people treat it?
[SPEAKER_03]: The number one will be people treating it
they don't want a lot of food they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: even though you kind of lose the tie look
out and when I get to the rainbow part
[SPEAKER_03]: it's still so prevalent and they're just
light-handed there's I mean I feed quarter
[SPEAKER_03]: strength of these base nutrients and
that's pretty much it I don't really do
[SPEAKER_03]: bloom boosters I I use a few bud swells
and a lot of a micro life organic products
[SPEAKER_03]: and things like that a little bio-bus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's pretty much all natural
ingredients and I still feed you know
[SPEAKER_03]: quarter and half strength is my capper and
I I don't get it to herm but I haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: actually had any of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody sent me a picture this is
completely honest the other day of one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the crosses and it had some had flowers
and balls on it and he showed me a picture
[SPEAKER_03]: of the bud and they were absolutely
devastated with toxicity the leaves are
[SPEAKER_03]: dead there was no trichomes and the flower
looked super dry and everything like that
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm all I just have to make sure
people realize you know take a easy hand
[SPEAKER_03]: with these you're gonna get a beautiful
flower no matter what you do as long as
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't overdo it so but tie indoors it
takes a little while to get her accustomed
[SPEAKER_03]: to it and if you're growing from a seed
you're gonna you know even if you get some
[SPEAKER_03]: bananas on one grow or a few balls on the
grow if the plants amazing you you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: really have to just instantly kill it try
again one more time because you can grow
[SPEAKER_03]: it out of it in certain situations and
then you'll know was it stressed or was it
[SPEAKER_03]: because it was a seedling or what it was
did I do something wrong so give it
[SPEAKER_03]: another shot just keep your eyes on them
but I haven't seen in saying that I
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't seen unsolicited hermaphrodism and
the seeds other than the ones I've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: when the plants are just absolutely beat
to shit or burnt up and things like that
[SPEAKER_03]: which I still don't like I still didn't
like to see that that that plant threw out
[SPEAKER_03]: balls on a seedling with flowers at all
but with how much it looked like it was
[SPEAKER_03]: being fed and I don't know some of these
guys are using some pretty crazy acids and
[SPEAKER_03]: it'll drop the pH so much and fluctuate
that stuff and any plant has a potential
[SPEAKER_00]: to drop out and under those circumstances
yeah without a doubt so one thing I did
[SPEAKER_00]: you know immediately pick up on was the
quality of your weed you know some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best I've ever had without it being so
all-grown what's your style of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly you kind of touched on it a second
ago but you know like let's how do you do
[SPEAKER_03]: it exactly you fill us in on the details
okay I use the cheapest medium I can get
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's cocoa core or basement mix or
whatever oh tupper not basement mix tupper
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever cocoa mix I can get I use truly
whatever I can get for about ten bucks and
[SPEAKER_03]: then they reuse it a few times I'm a
calcium amino junkie those are two things
[SPEAKER_03]: that I use a lot of I really really like
tricant and all so I do a lot of work with
[SPEAKER_03]: alfalfa and beeswax I go I got a lady out
here in the Orange Groves who sells wax
[SPEAKER_03]: the the comb with a little bit of honey in
it and I'll boil it down to make sure I
[SPEAKER_03]: get the tricant and all out things like
that the reason I can only use that at
[SPEAKER_03]: certain times though because it can it's
an antimicrobial so it can kill some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the microbes so you don't use that in the
teas and things but it's a huge source of
[SPEAKER_03]: trying can't know I love my micro life
products they're really well made the
[SPEAKER_03]: company is so easy to stand with and
behind and so I like that and then my guy
[SPEAKER_03]: Adrian from bio biz he hooks me up with a
lot of bio biz products his sisters have
[SPEAKER_03]: his sister and mom has some of the same
elements as I do so I share medicine with
[SPEAKER_03]: them and he in returns you know shares the
bio biz with me and it's a pretty amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: product but you know I keep things pretty
simple rainbow grows itself it truly does
[SPEAKER_03]: like so special about her and I can't I
don't really tell myself or to my own horn
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I'm a good grower everything I grow
whether it's whatever I'm growing it turns
[SPEAKER_03]: out good so but I kind of just let the
plants tell me what they want what they
[SPEAKER_03]: need and I've done it for so freaking long
I just I don't measure anymore I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want a pH meter I don't want a TDS or EC I
don't know anything I still grow people
[SPEAKER_03]: were like well you can't do that in large
facilities I'm all okay well I do it in 20
[SPEAKER_03]: lighters I've done it in a 50 lighter is
that how big is a large facility to you
[SPEAKER_03]: you know I just have to do it on a larger
scale I just pour more into my my
[SPEAKER_03]: reservoirs but I am the worst person ever
to try to mimic his gross because I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: do the same things over and over that I
know of I used to take monotonous notes
[SPEAKER_03]: where I would have binders and I keep
track of what I did this grow and change
[SPEAKER_03]: this and change that and eventually I just
got these products I really like and I do
[SPEAKER_03]: the same thing you know with these
products and sometimes I'll use more
[SPEAKER_03]: calcium if it's a new batch of cocoa that
I'm using I'll really use a ton of calcium
[SPEAKER_03]: at the beginning to help saturate it amino
is really a big part of that because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're the building blocks that I cherish
and I'm obsessed with carbohydrates and
[SPEAKER_03]: things like that but I don't really push
anything I don't use salts I don't go for
[SPEAKER_03]: weight I think that's another thing that
helps me is I don't really push like oh I
[SPEAKER_03]: need to maximize my yield I need the best
yield I need the best yield if I get a
[SPEAKER_03]: really good harvest a bumper crop I'm
super excited but if I got a great crop
[SPEAKER_03]: with a lower quality I would be mad the
rainbow that you got from me I thought I
[SPEAKER_03]: did terrible that grow I had an electrical
issue I wish you were here now to see this
[SPEAKER_03]: batch of rainbow because it's one of the
best batches I've a flower I've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: produced out of any of my spots Wow that
would be something to be seen so I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: with all that being said what would be
maybe one or two tips you'd have for our
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners whether it be you know common
mistakes you see or just things you've
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of picked up on don't overwater don't
overwater especially early there's a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of people who say you got a water cheat
cocoa like hydro you cheat cocoa like soil
[SPEAKER_03]: you get soil results so people start
hitting that cocoa right when it transfers
[SPEAKER_03]: the first few weeks on the plant and cocoa
let it dry out let those roots chase and
[SPEAKER_03]: fill up your buckets or whatever you're
growing in then you can turn on the turn
[SPEAKER_03]: on the gates and start to give it food in
saying that if you're going to water cocoa
[SPEAKER_03]: every day and you're using nutrients every
day use half strength because you're
[SPEAKER_03]: feeding every day now you don't need to
push it to the limit always if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: using solids add a product like drip clean
or something to keep it clean and keep
[SPEAKER_03]: your salt and mobile don't overthink it
don't overdo it don't think that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: you can need 50 bottles to finish this
plant pick a company's line and something
[SPEAKER_03]: simple for you and write it out there's a
reason why they have everything for you
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that they spent a lot of money
making those lines and try to use just the
[SPEAKER_03]: base nutrients on the grow if it's one of
your first grows just get your A and B or
[SPEAKER_03]: your A B and C dependent on the company
and just that just write those out see
[SPEAKER_03]: your quality and then if you want add
another product and don't shortchange your
[SPEAKER_03]: plant on you know your calcium and and
aminos those are two very very key things
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're not using those products add it
to it and you'll be impressed with what
[SPEAKER_00]: you get from it yeah definitely so feel
free to decline dance this one if you want
[SPEAKER_03]: what's your favorite grow product
photosynthesis plus photo see in
[SPEAKER_00]: California from microbe life nice that's
with the photosynthetic bacteria isn't it
[SPEAKER_03]: yes it is it's super super awesome I
foliar foliar my clones I soak my fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: cuttings I use that stuff like it's going
out of style it smells my daughter named
[SPEAKER_03]: it fart potion years ago and because every
time I come home she'd be like you were
[SPEAKER_03]: using fart potion daddy and I'm oh yeah
lots of fart potion baby and that one is
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a special special product and
honeycomb I'm from the gala I'm so well
[SPEAKER_03]: the orange grows are with them the bees
that product is super super phenomenal
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a few other products though that I
really like there microbe life has an
[SPEAKER_03]: amino product that I don't think I could
grow without
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a oh gosh there's a new not a new
company it's a new product to me it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: element tool from roots organic I'm just
discovering this product to powder calcium
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like 30 something percent calcium and
it's changed how I have to force calcium
[SPEAKER_03]: on to brand new cocoa I sprinkle that on
the top and the first water it just
[SPEAKER_03]: saturates all my cocoa with calcium and
Budswell I really really really love
[SPEAKER_00]: Budswell nice that's a that's a pretty
comprehensive list for everyone there you
[SPEAKER_00]: go so next question I want to ask you
could be pretty standard and we've already
[SPEAKER_00]: touched on it but do you have any kind of
modifications to what would be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: the standard light schedules whether it be
for veg or flower I go full spectrum so I
[SPEAKER_03]: go metal halide HPS metal halide HPS and
all my rims I'm ID so that's how I flower
[SPEAKER_03]: my plants I used to switch out to 10k
bulbs at the end but it became more of a
[SPEAKER_03]: chore then what I was seeing benefits and
then the mom room I'm pretty standard I go
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 on for off so they I still like my dark
cycles on the plant to at least have some
[SPEAKER_03]: dark I don't really run 24 7 so it's
pretty basic except for my my flower rooms
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a more of a full spectrum why I
don't just like to pound the HPS I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: mix the metal highlights in there yeah
awesome and do you play pay any attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to things like vapor pressure deficit or
anything like that or do you just have a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty standard temperature and humidity
you like to try to maintain first few
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks I run really really high humidity 80
ish percent and my temperatures are around
[SPEAKER_03]: in the 80s as well and then after about
weeks when I hit about week three I start
[SPEAKER_03]: lowering my temperatures and my humidity
and then by the end I like to see my room
[SPEAKER_03]: get about no higher than 77 and I like my
night temps to be in the 60s and my
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity levels to drop them mentally yep
so what's your recommendations for curing
[SPEAKER_03]: humidity and temperature wise I usually
dry and I usually dry everything together
[SPEAKER_03]: chop them off and at long branches I still
hang dry everything like that I usually
[SPEAKER_03]: keep it about 73 degrees 74 degrees I my
humidity levels I tried to keep them
[SPEAKER_03]: around that 50 ish percentile and it dries
them kind of fast at the beginning not
[SPEAKER_03]: fast that's wrong but I make sure with big
heavy buds I don't get in any sort of bud
[SPEAKER_03]: rot or anything like that I keep fans
going but I always face them up into the
[SPEAKER_03]: ceiling just so it's blowing the air in
circles and then but after about five to
[SPEAKER_03]: seven days I usually turn off my
dehumidifiers once that big burst of a
[SPEAKER_03]: humidity is gone I'll turn off my
dehumidifiers and I'll let them sit for
[SPEAKER_03]: another three to four days and more of a
it's a humid room but the humidity levels
[SPEAKER_03]: are a little higher and then it kind of
slows down the drying process and then as
[SPEAKER_03]: soon as they're dry to me off the stems
and start trimming up my product in like
[SPEAKER_03]: my big key to it is though is I don't take
them off the stems that they're still
[SPEAKER_03]: moist I want them to be dry they can still
be moist at the stem the stem being moist
[SPEAKER_03]: is okay but my flowers have to be dry I
don't like to take them off the stem and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're still moisture I feel I lose some
smell and overall appeal and so when you
[SPEAKER_00]: breed is is there a specific attribute
that you rate above others like do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think that you know given we referenced
earlier how terpenes are the big thing at
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment do you think that if you're
going to release something it has to have
[SPEAKER_00]: you know good terpenes be eye-catching or
would you be willing to you know put
[SPEAKER_00]: something out there maybe wasn't so in
your face but if you smoked it you'd
[SPEAKER_03]: realize where the value was I the number
one thing will have to be the medicated
[SPEAKER_03]: part the high if you will it has to be
there like I've bred for myself or just
[SPEAKER_03]: pure flavor and stuff was probably 12%
even down to 8% with some of my calio
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses they were absolutely like low low
low THC but the flavor was amazing and but
[SPEAKER_03]: I found that some of my clients would
steer away from it towards my stronger
[SPEAKER_03]: ones so I breed for others for strength
first or I won't say my numbers are insane
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never had rainbow tested so I
couldn't tell you where she tests out at
[SPEAKER_03]: but her feeling the way you feel when you
smoke her you know that you smoked and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything just relaxes and that's one
thing I look for I look for everything to
[SPEAKER_03]: relax but not be sleepy so if that's if I
was to pick something I know it's a weird
[SPEAKER_03]: thing to pick my entire body to relax I
want my head to be pushed back where I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: all there it is but I don't want to be
sleepy because I work a lot I have a
[SPEAKER_03]: daughter she's very busy I'm very involved
with her life on every day so I can't be
[SPEAKER_00]: sleepy groggy want to sit on the couch so
with that being said are you overall an
[SPEAKER_03]: indica guy or a sativa guy I I'm a
definite hybrid I don't like being any
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of racy because I've I've been I have
a heart thing so I've been cardioverted
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple times so I don't like my heart to
go fast anymore like I can't take it but I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to be couch locked so I'm
definitely a hybrid I'm a hybrid with a
[SPEAKER_03]: sativa leaning for the upbeat part but
only to an extent I'm very picky I am
[SPEAKER_03]: probably the pickiest person I know when
it comes to cannabis and you need to like
[SPEAKER_03]: pick a side I want it down the middle like
truly like I want this perfect perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: thing yeah okay it's a good good standards
right yeah I guess I'm just an ass so just
[SPEAKER_00]: jumping back to the breeding for a second
I forgot to ask this one back then what's
[SPEAKER_00]: your protocol for male pollination do you
kind of like you know put the females in a
[SPEAKER_00]: few weeks ahead then put the males in and
then just let them go and do their thing
[SPEAKER_03]: like how do you do it okay so I put my
girls in until flower and I want good
[SPEAKER_03]: flower setting I actually like week three
ish where I'm already having really good
[SPEAKER_03]: flower sets then I'll introduce the male I
always put the male into the room I always
[SPEAKER_03]: keep a clone that's already rooted in the
bedroom so I don't lose my boy the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: male goes into the room as soon as he
starts dropping pollen I'll put the fans
[SPEAKER_03]: on them all around in there I'll give them
about two days and then I kill the male
[SPEAKER_03]: bag them and take them out I don't want
any later pollinations I don't want dark
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds and then continue to pollinate as my
flowers go or a bunch of white seeds so I
[SPEAKER_03]: try to do my pollination I let him have
like two days where he starts really
[SPEAKER_03]: throwing his pollen and it's not like
first bag that opens it's when he really
[SPEAKER_03]: starts opening up I give him two days and
then after that once I feel that there's
[SPEAKER_03]: enough pollen in the air and everybody's
got it my boy comes out interesting and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard I can't remember who said it I
think it might have actually even been Ken
[SPEAKER_00]: from GDP but anyway regardless I heard
this weird sentiment expressed and I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to know if you'd ever had
experienced anything like this but
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the idea is if you pollinate
different branches with different males
[SPEAKER_00]: you would expect that you know you'd get
crosses representing the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: fathers but someone once said that like a
plant won't accept pollen from another
[SPEAKER_00]: male once it's already accepted pollen
from like a first or an initial male you
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's like any truth to that or it
just sounds hocus pocus I used to do a ton
[SPEAKER_03]: of limb by limb pollination I'm trying to
think if I actually use when I used more
[SPEAKER_03]: than one male on a single plant I know I
did when I did the chocolate cherry and I
[SPEAKER_03]: did I wanted the chocolate cherry AC DC
and I wanted the lavender Tripoli wicked
[SPEAKER_03]: AC DC so I hit branches with chocolate
cherry and they had branches with lavender
[SPEAKER_03]: AC DC and they both came out chocolate
cherry AC DC and lavender Tripoli wicked
[SPEAKER_03]: AC DC so I was able to do that yeah okay
cool might sound like a silly question to
[SPEAKER_00]: some people but I just might be hearing
that somewhere so what was the last strain
[SPEAKER_00]: besides one that you created that really
kind of just blew you away oh my goodness
[SPEAKER_03]: uh Riot just did this uh black I think
cause a black pie it's a great pie with
[SPEAKER_03]: his I want to say is Afghani oh my god it
is stunning it is truly I'm almost
[SPEAKER_03]: positive it's called black pie and it is
stunning and then Mad's original Tripoli
[SPEAKER_03]: wicked work was I was just talking about
it today it's truly truly truly special
[SPEAKER_03]: the original Tripoli wicked I think it's
Jackie Boy by Lavender or was it Tripoli
[SPEAKER_03]: by Lavender I think it was Jackie Boy by
Lavender that one was crazy it was the
[SPEAKER_03]: darkest of purples it looked so much like
Lavi but it had like this pink lemonade
[SPEAKER_03]: nose to it those two were really awesome
and dosido I can't knock dosido with that
[SPEAKER_03]: plant I found in those seeds is phenomenal
it really is so give me that black pie by
[SPEAKER_03]: riot and Tripoli wicked by mad and dosido
by archive and I had shit I'd be a happy
[SPEAKER_03]: camper I grew the two of them for a long
time that's awesome so just as a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: side note you grew the dosido from seed
what was it like to get those because I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember when they first came out like
they were just so hard to get and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were so limited offering how'd you score a
pack a friend of mine gave them to me
[SPEAKER_03]: actually to find a keeper he bought
everything that ever hit the market and he
[SPEAKER_03]: just that's what he did I've never seen a
seed collection quite like this ever he
[SPEAKER_03]: had those 50 gallon totes just full of
every breeder that I know and knew and
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't know from all over the world and it
was funny I had no idea what dosido was
[SPEAKER_03]: and he hits me up and was like hey I want
I have something I think you would like
[SPEAKER_03]: because at the time I was really hunting
with the OGKB and running through my own
[SPEAKER_03]: work with it and putting it through its
paces and hitting it with the red vine
[SPEAKER_03]: pallet and I was like what you got and he
was like well it's a somebody's work with
[SPEAKER_03]: OGKB you want to try it and I was like oh
yeah man I'd love to see it just in case I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't end up liking what I'm working on I
could work through those and he gave them
[SPEAKER_03]: to me and I popped I want to say six of
them the first day I think there was it
[SPEAKER_03]: was an odd number is either 11 or 13 seeds
in the pack and I popped six of them and
[SPEAKER_03]: the first six four were male and two were
female and those I killed the males
[SPEAKER_03]: because I kind of regret it but I killed
the males because I don't really work with
[SPEAKER_03]: other people's stuff without permission
then I kept the two females and they
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't they weren't what I was looking
for pop anymore and I end up popping the
[SPEAKER_03]: rest and then I found the dosi6 that I run
exclusively now as my dosidoka and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: you knew it was great in the moment she
started the flower you really did just the
[SPEAKER_03]: way she stacked the way she had her
structure I like plants that stretch and
[SPEAKER_03]: she stretched out really well and it was
just great and I watched it I was like god
[SPEAKER_03]: this is gonna be hard this is gonna be a
hard one to ever beat for me like in the
[SPEAKER_03]: room and when I finished her yeah it was
like people were saying like oh my god
[SPEAKER_03]: dude this is some of the best flower I've
ever had and I was like yeah it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: freaking strong it's like the same things
they said about rainbow they were saying
[SPEAKER_03]: about dosido and I was throwing the hell
out of it so yeah I got him gifted to me I
[SPEAKER_03]: shared the cuts back with him he
absolutely hated it so I went with the
[SPEAKER_03]: dosidoka what a change of events yeah yeah
he hated it because he can't stand plants
[SPEAKER_03]: that stretch he's on very very high height
height restrictions so he yeah he couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: do it I mean she's four times as four like
quadruples her size after flip she's she's
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy yeah I've got a dosido dominant
cross jelly breath and by god it's it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: handful yeah yeah they'll go wild wild but
yeah a lot of people have reached out for
[SPEAKER_03]: out to me now for my dosidoka after seeing
it and I've shared it with a few people
[SPEAKER_03]: one of them it died well he's moving so he
doesn't have it anymore and riot has it so
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping he can do some work with it
because so many things have gotten put on
[SPEAKER_03]: the back burner here with all the rainbows
and everything like that and now what my
[SPEAKER_03]: future plan is with it my dosi is gonna
just sit there and be for a while I got a
[SPEAKER_00]: question for you now relates to topic you
just kind of touched on in regards to you
[SPEAKER_00]: said you didn't really want to breed with
stuff you never permission these types of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions I find the devil's in the
details so I'm gonna give you a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: example because I think it'll make it
easier to answer if someone came up to you
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were like hey man I found a
really nice female in one of your packets
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to use it in a breeding program
and I'd be using a male that I created
[SPEAKER_00]: with other stuff would you be cool with me
using that what do you think about that I
[SPEAKER_02]: would say well I would say yes they bought
the seeds it's theirs use it just you know
[SPEAKER_03]: say what it is be honest about it when I
reached out to use my dosido female the
[SPEAKER_03]: first time I was told no to not use it and
then after the f2s came out and everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: was having it and everybody was working
with dosido I was all man I gotta be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to work with this paid a lot of money for
these seeds I put a lot of time and effort
[SPEAKER_03]: into these seeds I'm gonna make some
crosses with it I mean I'm pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: sure that that plant I'm the one who
helped bring that plant to where this is
[SPEAKER_03]: not dosido as a cross but my plant my
dosito my girl like the one that I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: growing I didn't create her but I brought
her to life and kept her and I was I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna work with it and so if anybody finds
something in any of my crosses do it the
[SPEAKER_03]: only thing that would ever affect me or
make me sad we'll say or anything like
[SPEAKER_03]: that like I got damn is this somebody
openly got something from me with that I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't release and they made f2s and sold
those f2s that would perturb me a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit because if I didn't plan on releasing
it and those kind of things what would
[SPEAKER_03]: give you the thought that you are like
your ass off to make this I found a boy
[SPEAKER_03]: and a girl and since he's put them
together now I'm releasing f2s of it that
[SPEAKER_03]: would seed like that to me isn't proper
but teach their own yeah it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting the way the dynamics of work
because I think ultimately what I was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of intending with that question was in my
mind that's one of the most reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: requests anyone can make you know it's
like I bought your seeds I'm using a
[SPEAKER_00]: female not a male so I don't know I think
people tend to look a bit more kindly upon
[SPEAKER_00]: that because you know you found it and
whatnot and then most importantly they say
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm gonna use a male that's different
I made it it's not related you know so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not just cramming two of your strains
together you know it's like it's unrelated
[SPEAKER_00]: and so yeah it's interesting that there
are some people out there who who would
[SPEAKER_00]: deny that one in my mind it's like that is
seemingly the most reasonable request you
[SPEAKER_00]: could make while still showing the respect
of asking and doing all that type of thing
[SPEAKER_03]: you know exactly I've been there I've been
on both sides of it I've asked politely
[SPEAKER_03]: and I would never tell anybody no on a
female especially like you just said if
[SPEAKER_03]: they were using hey I'm using a male I
created I found this extremely special
[SPEAKER_03]: female in your work can I be all like oh
my god yeah I'd probably be the kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the kind of guy be all like yeah but
you got to send me some seeds is like a
[SPEAKER_03]: joke you know I'll be all like but you
know I get some of those seeds like I got
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to at least see him or if you
find a killer cut let me get it
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's what I tell a lot of guys now
is all I have so many guys growing my
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff now I'm all like I want to see
pictures because if you having this many
[SPEAKER_03]: people grow my stuff is really rad because
they're basically putting on a search that
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do by myself so I have you know a
hundred dudes or something growing well
[SPEAKER_03]: men and women growing out all these said
strains they're growing 10 30 50 different
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds links I get to see all those
seedlings I get to see them all and be
[SPEAKER_03]: like like oh my god that one's absolutely
stunning would you be willing to trade me
[SPEAKER_03]: a cut and that you found in my seeds for
another pack of seeds or something else or
[SPEAKER_03]: two packs or whatever you want you know
like I want that one and believe it or not
[SPEAKER_03]: most people offer yes when it's my work
like the people who are growing my work
[SPEAKER_03]: and when I reached out to him and talked
to him about this they'd be all like
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely like they were so happy that
they I asked them and then they would ask
[SPEAKER_03]: me like well do you mind if I do a project
with it I'm all absolutely not you owner
[SPEAKER_03]: those you own those seeds and no but the
only time like I said I'd ever have an
[SPEAKER_03]: issue is with there were some packs that I
only released one pack and I did it to
[SPEAKER_03]: some friends or things along that nature
or certain people and if some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: people took that a single pack of seeds
where they got ten seeds and they took a
[SPEAKER_03]: single boy out of their massive selection
of three to five male single female on
[SPEAKER_03]: their giant selection of you know five
females and they made f2s and then
[SPEAKER_03]: released it that would it's disturbing
because of their selection size with ten
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds first off and then the second one I
never released it why would you release it
[SPEAKER_03]: you know like that that would be the only
hold up I've ever had with it and then
[SPEAKER_03]: again if somebody did it I'd probably look
past it anyways because how many projects
[SPEAKER_03]: do I have going I would never get to it so
who knows yeah it's interesting so kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: related to your breeding will we ever see
the release of any fems from you I've
[SPEAKER_03]: actually been getting a ton of requests
right it sent me his spray and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: something I am I'm gonna do because I
didn't realize how many of these guys in
[SPEAKER_03]: non-medical states and really really harsh
climates they can't afford to have boys
[SPEAKER_03]: and they've reached out to me and they've
asked me please make female seeds please
[SPEAKER_03]: make female seeds and I'm that person if
somebody asks me for something and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: capable of doing it most likely I'm gonna
do it for you even if it's not breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: just in life in general if I'm capable to
help somebody if somebody needs help I am
[SPEAKER_00]: going to help yeah that's awesome and so
with that in mind will you ever consider
[SPEAKER_00]: doing any commercial releases of some seat
like some really CBD orientated stuff I've
[SPEAKER_03]: made I was telling you earlier I've made
some CBD I'm working with some right now I
[SPEAKER_03]: put a little four by four section it's not
a huge section but I have a four by four
[SPEAKER_03]: of the chocolate cherry a CDC and the
other side the other four by four of this
[SPEAKER_03]: four by area is once chocolate cherry and
each Lavi Tripoli wicked and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: considering actually making some of those
into the the female seats so like if you
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to pop a CBD seeds you don't have
to go through a whole bunch and look
[SPEAKER_03]: through males and this and that it'll be a
female seed you get it you grow one it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: girl it's gonna have high CBD numbers and
amongst other things with it but I do I do
[SPEAKER_03]: want to release CBD because I use so much
CBD there's another day that goes by in my
[SPEAKER_03]: life that I don't use CBD products whether
it's from lozenges to gummies to I have
[SPEAKER_03]: tons of my coconut oil CBD that I usually
cook I'll buy a cup of CBD flowers from
[SPEAKER_03]: one of my organic friends and I'll make a
bunch of coconut oil with it and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: really strong and I take a shot of it
every morning or I'm not a biggest fan of
[SPEAKER_03]: the isolates of distillates because it's
just CBD I prefer a full plant extract but
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a few companies that make really
good distillates now I had some cream from
[SPEAKER_03]: a company not too long ago and there's
some of the best like a face lotion I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever had it was really amazing yeah cool
so when you do that shot do you find you
[SPEAKER_00]: get as good of an effect from that say is
a comparative dose say sublingually or do
[SPEAKER_00]: you find that ingesting it makes it act a
little different kind of in the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: to THC is a little different when you say
combust it or inhale it well I really
[SPEAKER_03]: really like this this what I'm doing with
this coconut oil and drinking it for some
[SPEAKER_03]: reason it it takes a little while longer
for it to kick in but once it kicks in it
[SPEAKER_03]: feels that it lasts so much longer and I
don't like anything with the alcohol
[SPEAKER_03]: tinctures in it so the I like to just use
the coconut oil and I feel that since it's
[SPEAKER_03]: a fatty oil that it does better going
through my digestive tract to really
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb everything yeah for sure so kind of
relating back to the topic we were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about earlier in regards to breeding other
people's work I mean not really but kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of in that general area how like what
would be your general advice to someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who is trying to make the transition from
say a grower to a breeder like if you if
[SPEAKER_00]: if you were talking to say someone who's a
grower and they're saying to you I'd like
[SPEAKER_00]: to become a breeder but I'm not really
sure what to do what do you think are kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of some of the things you have to do
before you can you know really consider
[SPEAKER_03]: taking it on and becoming a breeder so to
speak well I always tell everybody breed
[SPEAKER_03]: for yourself first always breed for you
because worst case you make some stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that you know you're going to enjoy that's
probably my most important if I make
[SPEAKER_03]: something that I absolutely love then how
can I ever be sad about it you know so as
[SPEAKER_03]: long as you're breeding for you you're
golden and then other if other people
[SPEAKER_03]: start to like it and you're able to put it
out there and have people even buy them
[SPEAKER_03]: from you and then grow them and that's
just all icing on the cake but the number
[SPEAKER_03]: one thing should always be breed for
yourself don't go in there thinking you're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna make money off of it or you're gonna
do this or that how would I say we're
[SPEAKER_03]: about to do don't start breeding before
you've ever seen a plant don't buy a pack
[SPEAKER_03]: of seeds and think oh I'm gonna cost this
pack of seeds with that pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: you've never even seen the plants you're
going to pretty much set yourself up for
[SPEAKER_03]: failure seed the plants grow the plants
find the plants that are special and then
[SPEAKER_03]: go to it then if you find these girls that
are an amazing girl I would love to see
[SPEAKER_03]: her with wow I found this really really
nice boy over here those two should pair
[SPEAKER_03]: well together I'll breed those two
together but don't go in there thinking I
[SPEAKER_03]: bought pack A from this breeder I brought
pack B from this breeder and I'm breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: them together because then no matter what
you're breeding them whether the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: suck or not okay awesome so interestingly
enough we've seen a rise in the both the
[SPEAKER_00]: general interest and the concern of
breeders involvement with phylos how do
[SPEAKER_00]: you feel about phylos do you feel it's
just a tool you know engage with it if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want or what do you feel it's maybe I've
heard for some people kind of say that it
[SPEAKER_00]: could be like the first step to something
a little more sinister in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: patenting things like that what's your
opinion on it all I don't like the patent
[SPEAKER_03]: in part because you could have some random
guy that patents something that he had
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing to do with so I'll just start
there with that just a little saying what
[SPEAKER_03]: I do enjoy about it though is that some
people pretend that they're the only
[SPEAKER_03]: people in the world with these clones or
these guys who say that they created this
[SPEAKER_03]: but they don't have any males or any other
females they just have this one singular
[SPEAKER_03]: plant well if it gets tested and compared
to other plants you can kind of know who's
[SPEAKER_03]: made one what's what and people that be a
little more honest but the problem with it
[SPEAKER_03]: will be is their samples their samples
have to be what they truly are so in some
[SPEAKER_03]: of these older plants the Kim's for
instance if their sample isn't really
[SPEAKER_03]: let's say it's one of the ones I've grown
and then somebody has a real Kim and they
[SPEAKER_03]: bring it in there and they don't match
well how do you know which one's the fake
[SPEAKER_03]: one and which one's the real one so
that'll be the biggest issue I I like the
[SPEAKER_03]: part that you can kind of dissect these
plants and say well that person is using
[SPEAKER_03]: this person genetics because they match up
perfectly so they're just got a funeral of
[SPEAKER_03]: that and then they're working with it so I
do like that aspect I guess it's a cool
[SPEAKER_03]: thing but the rest of it is I don't know
it's the whole thing is does it really
[SPEAKER_03]: matter like does it matter who made this
or who is claiming that or who did this
[SPEAKER_03]: it's an amazing strain that's an amazing
strain if you have it you have it if you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't you don't it is it is what it is I
think a lot of it gets down to that whole
[SPEAKER_03]: dick measuring thing you know like that's
mine no I made that first no I did that
[SPEAKER_03]: first so I don't know man that one's a
tough one I'm glad it exists but I can see
[SPEAKER_00]: the massive amounts of issues it's gonna
cost yeah okay so quick little sneaky grow
[SPEAKER_00]: question I'm gonna sneak in here I didn't
ask anything about IPM you know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: your protocol like clean and prevention is
best or do you have any sort of IPM
[SPEAKER_03]: routine you do if you notice an issue I
used to use a product called green cleaner
[SPEAKER_03]: religiously at least every two weeks or so
not because I had bugs but just because it
[SPEAKER_03]: was a rad product and it cleaned
everything one one time there was blue
[SPEAKER_03]: green cleaner in my body my bottle and
it's always green and sprayed it on my
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and lost about my entire mom's
because it was their root cleaner it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: root cleaner put in their foliar one so
after that happens I pretty much just take
[SPEAKER_03]: great care of my plants if I bring a plant
in from a known source or let's not even
[SPEAKER_03]: say an unknown source because I would
never bring a plant in from an unknown
[SPEAKER_03]: person if I bring a plant in from somebody
else it goes through the scope it goes
[SPEAKER_03]: through the isolation chamber and it just
gets checked I usually I love cinnamon so
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll use cinnamon oil and spray around the
plant I won't bring anything in that's all
[SPEAKER_03]: already in dirt because those whole root
aphid epidemic is out of control it so I
[SPEAKER_03]: will only bring in unrooted cuttings that
I can root myself and my chamber and watch
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants and make sure that no bugs pop
up and things of that nature and I usually
[SPEAKER_03]: keep my humidity levels in that room
pretty high just to force them that would
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly be on the plant yeah okay so
recently you know at the Emerald Cup there
[SPEAKER_00]: was this kind of sentiment which
thankfully has been cleared up there will
[SPEAKER_00]: be an Emerald Cup next year but the
sentiment was around like what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Cup gonna be like next year you
know what's your predictions given the
[SPEAKER_03]: legal changes in California recently well
I was seeing that they're going to allow
[SPEAKER_03]: at fairground type things like at
fairgrounds they're gonna allow these
[SPEAKER_03]: events to take place like they used to so
you won't need all these huge licenses and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that I truly felt that if the
only people who are gonna be able to sell
[SPEAKER_03]: at these shows where the big corporations
who would go I mean I don't want to go and
[SPEAKER_01]: give you $90 or a subpar eight no see
nobody who breeds seeds could be there
[SPEAKER_03]: because the guy most a lot of who have
been grinding the seed they're not giant
[SPEAKER_03]: money guys they're not doing all these
things are they gonna be able to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational license to sell seeds and
things like that so I think that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna see a swing back to the way it was
just for events just turn a blind eye for
[SPEAKER_03]: events and then continue down this new
road on uh daily living if you will or you
[SPEAKER_03]: know uh in the in the rec world I'm so
anti this rec scene I've I've been peeking
[SPEAKER_03]: in on places and checking places out I
mean uh a friend showed me he went to
[SPEAKER_03]: harborside and bought five eighths of some
of the worst outdoor cannabis I've ever
[SPEAKER_03]: seen but it was all packaged in glass jars
and fanciness and he spent over four
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred dollars on five eighths of brown
stuff it was it was unbelievable and they
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't even let him see the flower or
smell the flower or touch it but he wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: and how much of it he wanted and they
handed him a sealed container that he paid
[SPEAKER_03]: for it crazy yeah great that's why this
rec it's gonna work for some but it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna work for me most yeah totally right
so what do you foresee to be the future um
[SPEAKER_00]: is it a good time to be a medium to small
scale grower if you can grow really good
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis um you're always going to have a
place in the industry um because of those
[SPEAKER_03]: reasons people aren't going to go to the
shops and want to spend that kind of money
[SPEAKER_03]: on the eight uh middle of the road stuff
they're just not going to we'll we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: think change I'm sure it will but boutique
growers will always have a place in the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry because if you can grow amazing
stuff that nobody else has and people want
[SPEAKER_03]: it they're gonna they're going to buy it
so you can continue you know it's a job I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean it takes a lot of time effort and
money to produce top-of-the-line cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: and the hopefully the prices can continue
to support those kind of growers yeah okay
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's not all doom and gloom like some
might make out I don't think so I people
[SPEAKER_03]: are still taking all my rainbow off of my
my hands that I need to have for my
[SPEAKER_03]: medical patients and with I have to stop
moving it because I run out so I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: sure we'll be okay on that same note
though the the kind of the meme sentiment
[SPEAKER_00]: at the last emerald cup was that if all
these small-scale guys were to die out all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them were just gonna immediately become
breeders as like you know a bit of a joke
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was a little bit of that
sentiment a lot of people were switching
[SPEAKER_00]: over and it does in general seem as though
the number of breeders in the market and
[SPEAKER_00]: just in general it's kind of exponentially
increasing how do you think this is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to affect things in the long term you know
do you think it's going to be hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: stand out every name has seeds or genetics
in it on instagram I swear guys who have
[SPEAKER_03]: never even made a seed have you know
so-and-so seeds or so-and-so genetics I
[SPEAKER_03]: think what's gonna have to happen is
you're gonna have to have your own place
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like like how my brother has purple
people who want purple seeds we'll go to
[SPEAKER_03]: see him to get his purple seeds the or or
you're gonna have to have something that
[SPEAKER_03]: really stands out like luckily for me
rainbow is a huge huge you know selling
[SPEAKER_03]: point people see here and they're like wow
that is a special cannabis plant I would
[SPEAKER_03]: like to try that or I would like to have
some of the seeds or some of the flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: so so those are gonna be big things I
don't know how well people will do who and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're just working with this breeder and
this breeder and putting them together and
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to eat I don't know how well those
those kind of places will survive with the
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of breeders flooding the market now
but there's enough growers that want seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds will still sell oh that's good to
hear so what do you think is kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way for the community to move forward
in a sense do you think that we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: trying more to kind of band our efforts
together for like greater good goals that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know like require people to band
together like things like a legislative
[SPEAKER_00]: change we know like you can't really do it
on your own or do you think that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: better to just you know kind of everyone
focus on doing their own thing and just
[SPEAKER_03]: have more unity within the movement in
general the unity thing it should it
[SPEAKER_03]: should be it's so hard to see so many
fights and over naming rights or it's all
[SPEAKER_03]: just about money in reality all the fights
around money so that's always hard to be
[SPEAKER_03]: banding together I with a good voice and
the lead to help push it it would it could
[SPEAKER_03]: work but our problem is is that everybody
is their own leader they own everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: wants to yell but not listen so that would
be the hardest part especially in this
[SPEAKER_03]: community everybody has a voice but nobody
has ears and they all want to just scream
[SPEAKER_03]: scream scream and this this this instead
of like hey why don't we all get together
[SPEAKER_03]: and let's you know hash out these major
things and let's get on board with fixing
[SPEAKER_03]: this I still can't believe this 64 passed
in California blew my mind like I was
[SPEAKER_03]: telling everybody I knew hey it's a
terrible terrible idea it's not legalizing
[SPEAKER_03]: anything it's not recreationally
everything I mean if you have over
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis you can still go to prison how is
that okay how is it okay for anybody to go
[SPEAKER_03]: to prison for cannabis it doesn't make
sense it affected my life it's affected my
[SPEAKER_03]: family's life the prison for cannabis crap
you know since before I was born and I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean supposedly I was conceived during a
conjugal visit I mean come on it's
[SPEAKER_03]: affected my life nobody should be in
prison for cannabis this whole thing like
[SPEAKER_03]: oh we'll let them have one ounce anything
over that well we're putting them in
[SPEAKER_03]: prison there should be zero prison for
cannabis like that's the one thing that it
[SPEAKER_00]: has to stop it has to go away yeah yeah
good good point echo one of the last
[SPEAKER_00]: couple questions before we get into the
quick fires do you think overall
[SPEAKER_03]: legalization has had a net positive effect
or not it's better than it was it was when
[SPEAKER_03]: I was growing in the 90s and I could have
went to prison for one plant so at least
[SPEAKER_03]: we're taking steps forward and so we just
need a bunch of more big steps going
[SPEAKER_03]: forward so it's definitely better than one
plant in a person's yard you go straight
[SPEAKER_00]: to prison so I'll say that at least yeah
okay so what strain besides the rainbow
[SPEAKER_00]: has been the personal has been personally
the most rewarding for you to have created
[SPEAKER_03]: honestly the red line I mean that one can
I you know what I'm gonna leave out
[SPEAKER_03]: chocolate cherry red vine that rainbow
because it's one just trying to breathe
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna go with the blockhead work that
I did with the skunk that one stunk so bad
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not like rotted meat in a jar like it
actually would trigger my gag reflex I
[SPEAKER_03]: missed that one a lot I need to get back
into those seeds it was almost like trick
[SPEAKER_03]: flower I could like open the jar be I'll
smell this and they'd be and people would
[SPEAKER_03]: smell be like oh my god what is that like
do the same thing everyone got like gaggy
[SPEAKER_03]: over how repulsive that that plant smelled
that's awesome so down to the last
[SPEAKER_00]: quickfire questions who's the best grower
that you know oh man myself I did I I
[SPEAKER_01]: think I grow the best flower that I
personally know like but I think you know
[SPEAKER_03]: like locally to where I'm where I'm at I
don't see me oh no oh god I can't remember
[SPEAKER_03]: his name cultivar there's a guy named
cultivar on Instagram kid can fucking grow
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'll say cultivar yeah it's actually a
trick question the answer is jungle boys
[SPEAKER_00]: damn missed that one so what's your
prediction for the hottest strain of 2018
[SPEAKER_03]: most likely I'm gonna say probably
something crossed with freaking purple
[SPEAKER_03]: punch or with the Mac something in those
or one of the no Sunday driver from
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado will be the hot strain this year
nice yeah it's already got some traction
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure so opposite end of the spectrum
what's the worst strain to ever get a
[SPEAKER_01]: following behind it oh my god I know I
don't want to say this one you can tell me
[SPEAKER_01]: later I'll tell you later what was number
two though number two would be oh god it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a quirkle okay there you go if you
could only pick one land race to smoke for
[SPEAKER_03]: the rest of your life which one would it
be oh I would have to go with a Michoacan
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican nice pick nice pick so other end
of the spectrum in a way desert island
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can pick two strains any of them
doesn't matter modern or old what are they
[SPEAKER_00]: SCDC and rainbow ah nice what draws you to
the SCDC just like the Indica side of
[SPEAKER_03]: things or yeah it's it's kind of like
rainbow it has the best of both worlds the
[SPEAKER_03]: strawberry coffee still there and the deep
chunk is super prevalent and how does that
[SPEAKER_03]: little berry finish I mean I get her to
finish black like her the buttons turn
[SPEAKER_00]: black and she's a really really special
plant yeah she certainly looks it so what
[SPEAKER_03]: is the worst grow product the worst grow
product oh god it's the the silica from
[SPEAKER_03]: that really cheap silica everybody uses it
doesn't actually do anything for the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: good lord what's the name of that silica
that everybody uses it's not that OSA 28
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever oh no no not that was the
stuff I know this stuff is like $10 for a
[SPEAKER_03]: bottle oh shooting powder shooting powder
is terrible shooting powder is terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah for sure shooting powder is just the
worst alrighty so indoor outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse you can only have one which
ones are gonna be indoor nice last but not
[SPEAKER_00]: least question what is the best thing to
happen to cannabis since you've been
[SPEAKER_03]: involved with it the internet it's been
the best and the worst the internet's
[SPEAKER_03]: changed everything we have a giant giant
library that we all get to share if we
[SPEAKER_03]: choose it's changed everything no more
little pieces of paper writing to Europe
[SPEAKER_03]: seed breeders like everybody's on the
internet yeah it started well after I was
[SPEAKER_03]: already in cannabis but that was watching
that happen to cannabis and chat rooms and
[SPEAKER_03]: all these things getting cannabis and
breeding and seeds and clones it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing I think the internet changed
everything and it really changed cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah that's a really really really good
answer we haven't had before so I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that might just about wrap it up for this
one was there any comments or shout outs
