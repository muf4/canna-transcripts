[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome, budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your boy, Heavy Days, coming at you
from the Upside Down library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this episode, we're doing a meet
the sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with some incredible sponsors who
we're very proud to be affiliated with,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we want you guys to hear a little more
about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds here now, James Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard from him before, and you'll
hear again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on this episode, we're going to hear a
little bit from Matt from Premier Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk a little bit about ProMix Connect,
your number one Michael Rysel product,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as countless other products you're
probably familiar with and might already
[SPEAKER_00]: use, such as their mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Likewise, we're going to hear from Kevin
of Coper Biological Systems, an IPM expert
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field and a huge source of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: With knowledge for any IPM questions,
I'm really excited for you guys to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of fun talking to everyone,
and I hope you guys enjoy this as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So up first, we have Matt from Premier
Tech talking all things ProMix Connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to jump straight into this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing which I find really interesting
about Premier Tech and ProMix in general
[SPEAKER_00]: is that for years, the company has been
really well known in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community for providing really high
quality mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I think ProMix, I think a lot of
the media you guys produce, most notably
[SPEAKER_00]: that for a long time came inoculated with
Mike Ryser.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it that stimulated you guys to
sort of start looking into Mike Ryser and
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to pursue that pathway a little
further?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, like you said, we're really well
known in the industry by the growing
[SPEAKER_05]: media.
[SPEAKER_05]: ProMix HP wasn't really developed for
cannabis, but it ended up being like an
[SPEAKER_05]: amazing growing media to grow the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we wanted to address the market more
specifically.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking at our technology,
what is available, and looking at the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant and the growth cycle and everything,
how we can contribute.
[SPEAKER_05]: And seeing all the product out there,
we felt like we're able to bring a high
[SPEAKER_05]: end product on the market that will help a
grow great cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a really good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of stimulates me to start thinking
all about Mike Ryser myself and maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to sort of discuss is to start at
the beginning, which is how do you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: grow Mike Ryser?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the process behind doing that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have a really unique process at
Premier.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, it's all done in-house with our
technologies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the Mike Ryser industry,
there's basically two ways of producing
[SPEAKER_05]: mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the first one, I would say the
most common and I would say the easiest in
[SPEAKER_05]: the market is in vivo technique.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the mycorrhizal fungi is basically
grown on a full plant that is usually
[SPEAKER_05]: grown into an inner medium.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be clay or sand, for example.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you harvest all that inner
medium, the root system of the plant and
[SPEAKER_05]: the fungi itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's constitute the base of the
mycorrhizal product.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are certainly a couple of flaws
with that technique.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, it's less expensive, but at the same
time, it's harder to ensure no presence of
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogen, control the type of genetics of
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_05]: You end up with a product and it's harder
to control also the concentration and the
[SPEAKER_05]: quality because you're growing it out
there on the full plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the beginning, like 30 years ago,
that's how Permetic was doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with a lot of years and research,
we've developed a technique which is in
[SPEAKER_05]: vitro technique.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of grown on the artificial root
system of a plant in kind of a mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_05]: micro reactor, if I can call it that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I don't even know the process at
all because it's a well-guarded secret in
[SPEAKER_05]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It requires special type of equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's done in the laboratory with aseptic
condition, with special type of expertise.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yes, it's more expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you're able to produce massive amount
of mycorrhizae, enormous concentration,
[SPEAKER_05]: and a very high quality product at the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I had read a long time ago that
some types of plants and root systems will
[SPEAKER_00]: produce mycorrhizae naturally,
but it sort of like takes years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sound correct?
[SPEAKER_05]: A plant in itself cannot grow mycorrhizae
by its own.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way it can grow mycorrhizae is because
it would have like a viable spores or
[SPEAKER_05]: mycorrhizal structure in the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the symbiosis happened with the
root system, well, the mycorrhizal fungi
[SPEAKER_05]: are going to develop itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at some point you can harvest the
mycorrhizae directly on the root system of
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I guess my follow-up question was,
I was always wondering, well, if you went
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere that had like really old,
established, mature growth, like say like
[SPEAKER_00]: the Redwood forests in Humboldt or like,
you know, somewhere with really
[SPEAKER_00]: established growth, could you try to
harvest mycorrhizae from that soil or not
[SPEAKER_00]: really?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, for example, Prumitec didn't
invent mycorrhizae or anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mycorrhizae was found in the woods by
digging out some roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you have very old, you know,
growth operation outdoor, or even in the
[SPEAKER_05]: forest or stuff like that, you can
definitely find mycorrhizae in the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I guess obviously it's pretty
variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the mycorrhizae product you
guys create, I'm assuming that consistency
[SPEAKER_00]: is probably some, like one of the benefits
you can sort of bank on when buying a high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality mycorrhizae product like Promix
Connect sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Consistency is a big thing, especially for
a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're growing a high valuable
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you want to be able to have consistency
in each of the batch of the mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_05]: that you've purchased.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've just talked about the method
that we're using to produce that
[SPEAKER_05]: mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_05]: That ensure a very high quality product
each and every time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But not only that, you know, we test each
and every batch each time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for Promix Connect, especially it's a
very small batch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we validate the number of valuable
spores for each batch, the content of
[SPEAKER_05]: heavy metal as well, and also the presence
of microbial for example.
[SPEAKER_05]: So each batch of product that you can buy
out there is really, really high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was sort of wondering in terms
of like the viability of a mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: product, is there such a thing as like a
shelf life or it's sort of indefinitely
[SPEAKER_00]: stable?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's definitely a shelf life because,
you know, mycorrhizae at the end of the
[SPEAKER_05]: day is a live microorganism, you know,
so you have to keep it viable and live in
[SPEAKER_05]: order to have the benefit out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have like a two years shelf life,
assuming that it's keeping at the right
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature, you know, indoor temperature
is not too hot, not too cold, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, I would say we have a two years
shelf life, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's really quite good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, especially compared to some of the
other microbial products you get,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of more bacterially based ones that,
you know, the shelf life is quite limited
[SPEAKER_00]: compared comparatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: A question I was hoping you may be able to
answer for me is I had read in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: other mycorrhizal products, there can be
quite a bit of variation in terms of what
[SPEAKER_00]: the spores are mixed with or I think I
remember reading one time that mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: product I was using was it had like
azomite with the spores or something or
[SPEAKER_00]: zeolite or something like that and I guess
I was wondering, is that common process
[SPEAKER_00]: and does that affect the quality of the
product, the substrate it's sort of mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: or bound with?
[SPEAKER_05]: If I understand the question correctly,
you're talking about kind of the
[SPEAKER_05]: formulation of the product because the
thing is like mycorrhizae, it's a fungi
[SPEAKER_05]: and you can put it in different type of
carrier depending on how you want to bring
[SPEAKER_05]: the fungi to the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it could be like in the case of ProMix
Connect, it's a wettable powder but it
[SPEAKER_05]: could be granular form, zeolite is another
example of carrier that can be used and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a lot of different type of carrier
it could be into water but it's a bit more
[SPEAKER_05]: complicated since you have to keep in low
temperature to keep the viability but you
[SPEAKER_05]: can formulate the product in different
ways and that's definitely something that
[SPEAKER_05]: ProMitec has become expert at because it's
wanting to produce good mycorrhizae but
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to keep it viable until the
grower is actually using your product and
[SPEAKER_05]: formulation so keeping the mycorrhizae
alive on the carrier that you're choosing
[SPEAKER_05]: is a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah that is definitely something I was
hoping we could touch on a bit because
[SPEAKER_00]: something I had noticed and the reason why
I stepped away from that mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_00]: product I referenced in the past was as
you mentioned, you understood perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was trying to ask so apologies for
forgetting the word carrier and whatnot
[SPEAKER_00]: but you were right, it was a granule sort
of base mycorrhizae and I found it really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to apply it to like the root ball
when I was transplanting for example like
[SPEAKER_00]: it would just fall off like little grains
of rock sort of thing would you sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: guess that the way ProMix is made in the
sense that it's that wettable powder and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can really get a nice coating on the
root ball for example would you sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: guess that that's probably a better way of
applying it than say the granules I gave
[SPEAKER_00]: up on in the past?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah definitely you know in granular form
it can work as well the key here in
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis and mycorrhizae is to have
proximity between the spores and the roots
[SPEAKER_05]: you know that's how the symbiosis is going
to happen and that's why we developed
[SPEAKER_05]: ProMix Connect as a wettable powder it's
like you just said you have the most
[SPEAKER_05]: proximity with the root you're able to
create like a coating so like all the
[SPEAKER_05]: spores are really at the surface of the
roots so that's how you get I would say
[SPEAKER_05]: the fastest establishment and with that
you get the the best benefits out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah okay that makes sense that's good so
in the past I had sometimes added
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae to just my water and then
watered it in do you think that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna lead to sort of meaningful levels of
the spores getting to the roots or you
[SPEAKER_00]: really sort of want to do what you
mentioned and have it like proximally just
[SPEAKER_00]: really applied to the root itself if
possible?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say closest to the root is the
best you could have an impact by mixing it
[SPEAKER_05]: with water but clearly it's not efficient
enough for you know first mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_05]: isn't soluble so you have to keep like
agitation in your water in order for the
[SPEAKER_05]: mycorrhizae to stay mixed into your water
so that's that's first but even that the
[SPEAKER_05]: spore is going to have to attach itself to
the roots to have really an impact but
[SPEAKER_05]: probably a lot of them are going to be
washed away when you're applying your
[SPEAKER_05]: water you know so yes it could have an
impact but definitely not as much if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're applying it directly to your roots
okay sure and is there anything people can
[SPEAKER_00]: do that you're aware of that would
increase the ability for the the spore to
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully connect with the root like
maybe like soil temperatures or like the
[SPEAKER_00]: degree of how wet the medium is at the
time is there anything you're aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: that could help them get better benefit?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say mostly two things the water
not being too hot or too cold you know tap
[SPEAKER_05]: water is just fine when mixing the powder
for example and the second thing would be
[SPEAKER_05]: to maybe slow down on phosphorus for you
know two weeks after application and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of renowned out there that phosphorus
not going to kill the fungi at all it's
[SPEAKER_05]: just that if you have a lot a big amount
of phosphorus it's going to kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: inhibit the establishment of that
symbiosis you know so you want to give it
[SPEAKER_05]: a chance to those through those two first
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: sure I mean this is just sort of a
question that's come to mind but if
[SPEAKER_00]: someone was to use mycorrhizae in a like a
more of like a hydroponic setting where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using salt based nutrients and
they're late in bloom and they're applying
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of phosphorus and potassium and stuff
I guess by virtue of what you just said
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're probably not going to get that
much effect out of applying mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_00]: late in flower in that sort of situation
or it's still beneficial do you think?
[SPEAKER_05]: well the key anyway is not to apply the
product late in flower you know to have
[SPEAKER_05]: the best benefit out of the mycorrhizae is
to apply it as soon as possible so the
[SPEAKER_05]: goal we recommend to apply you know when
your clone is rooted that's when you when
[SPEAKER_05]: you do your first transplant that's when
you want to apply it because you know the
[SPEAKER_05]: establishment of the mycorrhizae and the
symbiosis take some times so the sooner
[SPEAKER_05]: you do the application the better the
benefits you know you're going to have at
[SPEAKER_05]: the end so I don't see the point of doing
it at the end like late flower when you're
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna harvest you know a month from from
that point yeah sure that makes a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sense so I mean you touched on earlier how
this is a high commodity crop it's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of value for people and that's something
I'm always trying to emphasize to people
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when people talk about the
economics of products and stuff I'm I sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of frequently try to remind them that you
know this is such a high value crop that
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes paying for premium inputs you're
gonna get a much better output and I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: in the case of mycorrhizae there's no
discussion in the community about whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it works just empirically you can see it
works when you use it it just it's so so
[SPEAKER_00]: night and day difference but I guess I'm
sort of wondering have you guys ever
[SPEAKER_00]: looked into or sort of tried to quantify
it all the benefit of using mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_00]: because I thought if I had to hazard a
guess I'd say it probably gonna get twice
[SPEAKER_00]: as much growth or something like very
dramatic increase have you guys ever
[SPEAKER_05]: looked into that sort of thing yeah yeah
of course one of our first single that we
[SPEAKER_05]: bring to the market is the return on
investment you know and the way we
[SPEAKER_05]: recommend to apply the product you know
you you're gonna kind of put an investment
[SPEAKER_05]: between one or three dollar a plant it
depends on how much powder or how you mix
[SPEAKER_05]: a product you know but you know one or two
three dollar a plant it's not much when
[SPEAKER_05]: for example let let's just say not not
even a high a high yield increase let's
[SPEAKER_05]: just say five percent you know five
percent on a big plant it could end up to
[SPEAKER_05]: be 20 gram you know 20 gram at five ten
dollar gram return investment is pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty easy but not only that we've was
really really important for us to yes the
[SPEAKER_05]: yield yes yield is always important but in
cannabis quality is everything craft
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis you know I feel it's a really
growing industry and you know you get top
[SPEAKER_05]: dollars for top flowers and by bringing
yes the yield but also the quality you
[SPEAKER_05]: know increased terpene increased
cannabinoids you were able to produce
[SPEAKER_05]: consistently higher quality flowers and
that you were able to get much more out of
[SPEAKER_05]: a crop even for example if you don't have
any yield increase you're gonna get better
[SPEAKER_00]: result as well yeah okay I mean that opens
the door to sort of discussing when might
[SPEAKER_00]: be the best time to use things in terms of
getting the best return on investment a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people use mycorrhizas sort of a
root stimulating agent instead of your
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional cloning gels or powders things
like that how would you use mycorrhizas
[SPEAKER_00]: would you say for example use it once when
stimulating the roots and then again when
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting what how would you tell if
your friend came up to you and said when
[SPEAKER_00]: should I be using mycorrhizas give me the
roadmap well I would just tell you how I
[SPEAKER_05]: personally use it myself you know most of
the growers are there anyway are now
[SPEAKER_05]: probably doing only one transplant that's
kind of the trend right now and anyway the
[SPEAKER_05]: most important application is the first
one and in my mind the best one is when
[SPEAKER_05]: you have a rooted clone that is ready to
be transplanted into a bigger pot because
[SPEAKER_05]: you know you have all those root exposed
and you have to have the contact like I
[SPEAKER_05]: said before the roots and the spores in
order to get the symbiosis going so I
[SPEAKER_05]: would say that's really really the key
moment to apply the product yeah okay
[SPEAKER_00]: great and I mean this one is kind of a
hard one to answer and that's why I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: asking you because I wasn't able to find
an answer but I've always been curious as
[SPEAKER_00]: to how mycorrhizas facilitated that root
stimulating process because it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: clear based on people's evidence of just
trialing it themselves that mycorrhizas is
[SPEAKER_00]: a reasonably is a pretty down good
effective rooting agent but I could never
[SPEAKER_00]: really like figure out like what was how
was it mediating this process do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: any idea about that or is that just
something we probably need to research a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more to figure out well mycorrhizae
mycorrhizal fungi basically need the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: to live that's how it works you know by
having that symbiosis going with the root
[SPEAKER_05]: system of a plant and that's how the
mycorrhizal fungi is able to thrive and
[SPEAKER_05]: develop itself you know create the IFE
network that bring the benefit the
[SPEAKER_05]: renowned benefit of the mycorrhizae which
is picking up water picking up nutrients
[SPEAKER_05]: you know and in return it's gonna help the
plant to thrive because if the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: thrived the fungi is gonna thrive as well
so if you have more water more nutrient
[SPEAKER_05]: you're gonna able to develop bigger root a
bigger structure bigger flower you know
[SPEAKER_05]: and higher quality it's all linked
together so if if the fungi is doing well
[SPEAKER_00]: well the plant is gonna do well as well so
okay yeah that's that's a really sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: nice explanation like so you're sort of
thinking that maybe there's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotaxic sort of process where the fungi
are stimulating the roots to ensure their
[SPEAKER_05]: own survival sort of thing well there's a
whole process behind of it you know I can
[SPEAKER_05]: go deep into each and every step you know
the the spores when you get into contact
[SPEAKER_05]: with the roots like physically it's gonna
detect where the roots is in the soil and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's gonna germinate towards it and at
some point it's gonna have a contact
[SPEAKER_05]: between the IFE and the roots the root in
itself and it's gonna penetrate the root
[SPEAKER_05]: cells and create structure inside the
roots of the plant and when those
[SPEAKER_05]: structure like arborous colon physical are
created inside the root and they are able
[SPEAKER_05]: to exchange energy and that's how the IFE
network then is going to be created and
[SPEAKER_05]: you know that relationship yes going to
bring more water and more nutrient but you
[SPEAKER_05]: know you're impacting also the immune
system of a plant you're basically
[SPEAKER_05]: stimulating the immune system of the plant
so that's kind of also where gene ends of
[SPEAKER_05]: quality cannabinoids and terpenes
compounds like that came from yeah wow
[SPEAKER_00]: okay that's that's really good information
to know so with that in mind how there's
[SPEAKER_00]: more sort of nutrient availability with
the presence of mycorrhizae would you sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of try to angle that effect as you could
get away with using less nutrients because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more available to the plant or would
you sort of try to pile up on it and be
[SPEAKER_00]: like well let's actually add more
nutrients and try to facilitate even
[SPEAKER_05]: greater uptake often I try to stay away
from that topic because you know cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: gore are really like personal in term of
using nutrients you know but for sure you
[SPEAKER_05]: can slow down on nutrients because you're
gonna pick up more but at the end of the
[SPEAKER_05]: day you can keep the same schedule and
you're gonna achieve better result as well
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's gonna maybe help you achieve
better like become like more nutrient like
[SPEAKER_05]: I said but also like avoid salt buildup
and stuff like that because you're having
[SPEAKER_00]: that much nutrient present into the soil
you know sure so I mean the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: our listeners as far as I'm aware are
soil-based growers but you know we like to
[SPEAKER_00]: show some love to our soil-less growers
from time to time so I guess my question
[SPEAKER_00]: is as far as you're aware does mycorrhizae
work equally as effective in sort of both
[SPEAKER_05]: styles of growing yeah you know our
mycorrhizae ProMix can it yeah of course
[SPEAKER_05]: it's ProMix it's worked well with our
growing media but it's compatible with
[SPEAKER_05]: other type of media you know as long as
you have a physical support for the roots
[SPEAKER_05]: and the fungi it is gonna work you know
rock wall or cocoa it's just fine directly
[SPEAKER_05]: into soil as well of course the only issue
I would say is pure hydroponic and to be
[SPEAKER_05]: more precise aeroponic because you don't
have a physical support to develop the
[SPEAKER_05]: root and the fungi so I'm not sure I would
work but in most cases mycorrhizae is
[SPEAKER_00]: compatible with kind of every style of
growing fantastic and from what I had read
[SPEAKER_00]: it sort of was saying that ectomycorrhizae
didn't really provide any benefit to
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis does that sound right to you yeah
no effect at all because it's kind of just
[SPEAKER_05]: a filler because at the end of the day the
mycorrhizal fungi is not gonna be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: connect with the root system because it's
just not compatible so you won't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: effect at all sure and I mean in the past
I'd seen mycorrhizal products which had
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of boasted being a blend of you know
six twelve different mycorrhizal strains
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that what's your thoughts on
that does it provide diversity or is it
[SPEAKER_05]: filler you know that's something that is
really popular in the market the most the
[SPEAKER_05]: better but unfortunately for mycorrhizae
it's not the case you know we've did a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of research at finding the best strain of
the best you know genetic of mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_05]: you know by putting any other mycorrhizae
in there you're just introducing
[SPEAKER_05]: competition with the mycorrhizae which
doesn't help the strain to thrive you know
[SPEAKER_05]: and to put other mycorrhizae in there you
have to dilute the amount of mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_05]: that you put in of your best strain so you
know it doesn't work that way yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: brilliant I'm glad to hear that from you
because that had been my suspicion for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while I think yeah I had read that yeah
the glomerular subspecies was the sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the bulk of the work so that's when
I started to wonder you know the the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: just sort of filler so I mean do you
suspect that going forward in maybe say
[SPEAKER_00]: more the long term you'll see companies
all switch to just sort of providing the
[SPEAKER_00]: one strain that's doing the bulk of the
work or do you think there's still just
[SPEAKER_00]: always going to be a bit of marketing at
play there's definitely always going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: some marketing but we have to keep in mind
and some people are just aren't able to
[SPEAKER_05]: produce a perfectly pure product you know
like I've talked earlier when you're using
[SPEAKER_05]: like in vivo technique of growing decal on
a plant it's hard to keep control of what
[SPEAKER_05]: is actually growing on the root system of
the plant so you have probably multiple
[SPEAKER_05]: species of mycorrhizae in there so I feel
like there's always going to be some
[SPEAKER_05]: product like that out there and people
that are actually able to produce eye
[SPEAKER_05]: concentration of a specific species
specific species is going to go that route
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually so with that in mind are you
aware of any other microbes which may sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of synergize well or just work well in
conjunction with mycorrhizae that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: personally fond of yeah honestly most
bacteria work really really well with
[SPEAKER_05]: mycorrhizae that's why for example our
promix plus line there's mycorrhizae and a
[SPEAKER_05]: bacillus inside our green media because
they work really really well together and
[SPEAKER_05]: for example if you're already using a
standalone product base back which is some
[SPEAKER_05]: bacteria it's going to help definitely
because bacteria work well when you have
[SPEAKER_05]: organic surface available because they
grow on the root you know and if you have
[SPEAKER_05]: the eye finite work that is well developed
well it's more surface for your bacteria
[SPEAKER_05]: to grow so there's definitely a good
synergy with most bacteria and mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah okay good to hear and I mean a bit
earlier you mentioned how mycorrhizae sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of directly can affect the plant's immune
system through the way it connects with
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots something I always try to talk
to people or listeners is about how when
[SPEAKER_00]: you affect the plant's immune system
beneficially you're essentially just
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing its ability to fight off pests
to fight off pathogens things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: would you say that essentially mycorrhizae
is doing that as well yeah definitely you
[SPEAKER_05]: know it's a big resistant to stress you
know if you're using mycorrhizae outdoor
[SPEAKER_05]: the death rate of your crop is going to be
way lower than without it because you know
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a bigger resistant to stress and you
just you just said it if you're able to
[SPEAKER_05]: defend yourself against pests and stuff
like that well that's translating to
[SPEAKER_05]: higher terpenes higher catabinoids because
you know those compounding cannabis wasn't
[SPEAKER_05]: meant for for you meant to get high it's a
defense mechanism from the plant so if
[SPEAKER_05]: you're able to defend yourself more easily
you know produce more terpene and more
[SPEAKER_00]: catabinoids you know yeah I wholeheartedly
agree and I love I love that you bring
[SPEAKER_00]: that up you know like as as much as we'd
like to think we're masters of the
[SPEAKER_00]: universe this this plant that's near and
dear to our heart is essentially just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to fight off some bugs at its core
exactly exactly that's good I don't know
[SPEAKER_04]: who told me that but basically cannabis is
a sexually frustrated plant it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to reproduce itself and we're not
letting it it like reproduce itself we
[SPEAKER_04]: don't want to have any seeds so she's just
keeping on putting flowers and hoping that
[SPEAKER_00]: some pollen is gonna come his way oh my
god that's hilarious exactly there you go
[SPEAKER_00]: okay cool well I mean something I've done
in the past and I'm happy to throw myself
[SPEAKER_00]: under the bus here a little bit with this
is I sort of just wanted to experiment a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit and make some weird and wonderful
microbial mixtures so I'd sort of just mix
[SPEAKER_00]: a few different microbial powders together
and then make a little slurry and apply it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the roots and just sort of see how it
goes have you heard anything about that
[SPEAKER_00]: working good working bad is there any
mixtures you might recommend avoiding like
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess maybe one I was thinking about
initially was do you want to avoid mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: different fungal spores together or not a
real problem with that what's your take
[SPEAKER_05]: like I said before I don't really consider
myself to be like a grower per se so I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't have a lot of knowledge on that
subject but you know I know growers that
[SPEAKER_05]: are using you know live bed to grow
cannabis you know mixing a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: different kind of fungal composed a
different type of microorganism you know
[SPEAKER_05]: creating like an alive soil and I
definitely see people having a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: success with that but if you ask in my
personal opinion I just I just find that
[SPEAKER_05]: it's maybe a bit more trouble because
you're having deluxe that you provide you
[SPEAKER_05]: have it like an external containers you
know so you're able to control what you're
[SPEAKER_05]: providing to your plants so why putting
like so much into it and not able to
[SPEAKER_05]: manage like specifically when you want to
create you know okay sure and another one
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd sort of always wondered about which I
think you might be able to answer for me
[SPEAKER_00]: is sometimes when I'd seen people making
compost like mixing a bunch of amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know maybe alfalfa and kelp and a
big pile and then cooking it up before
[SPEAKER_00]: they eventually grow with it I'd seen them
adding mycorrhizae at that step and just
[SPEAKER_00]: when they mix their compost pile and then
let it sit for a while and I thought did
[SPEAKER_00]: the spores just sit there stagnant waiting
or what what do you think happens there
[SPEAKER_05]: you know we haven't made any study on that
I don't think so but personally I think
[SPEAKER_05]: that maybe there could be some effect at
some point because maybe some of the
[SPEAKER_05]: spores gonna stay dormant into the compost
but at the same time there's so much heat
[SPEAKER_05]: into it probably most of it's gonna die
but depending on how you proceed maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the the mycorrhizae gonna stay
alive and at some point if you are having
[SPEAKER_05]: there's proximity with a root that is
growing into the compost or the mix that
[SPEAKER_05]: you created there's gonna be some effect
at some point yeah I guess that's what I
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of figured that like you're sort of
trying to prime the medium to be ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots but yeah I guess that that hot
composting process might might take its
[SPEAKER_00]: toll on some of the spores okay well I
mean on the other end of the spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: another thing I had sort of wondered in a
similar fashion was when people were
[SPEAKER_00]: brewing teas or making nutrients for their
plants and they might you know bubble it
[SPEAKER_00]: with an air stone for a few days before
they use it and they were throwing
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae powder into that mixture and
letting it bubble for a few days do you
[SPEAKER_05]: have any thoughts on that side of process
like I said earlier it's kind of tricky to
[SPEAKER_05]: put mycorrhizae sometime into water
because water makes like chemical compound
[SPEAKER_05]: more available for the mycorrhizae so
sometime you know how mycorrhizae preserve
[SPEAKER_05]: is like the spores are dormant you know
and when you put it in contact with water
[SPEAKER_05]: they can they can come across some
chemicals that gonna you know trigger them
[SPEAKER_05]: to to germinate and when they germinate at
some point then not gonna have any energy
[SPEAKER_05]: left to create that symbiosis so like
putting it into water it's kind of a risky
[SPEAKER_05]: move right from the get-go but like you
just mentioned there's so much technique
[SPEAKER_05]: out there that definitely at some point
some kind of effect but definitely not as
[SPEAKER_05]: much as the classic way that we recommend
like directly on the root system you know
[SPEAKER_00]: okay I think I had read somewhere in the
past that mycorrhizae can die after as
[SPEAKER_00]: little as say 24 hours after being put
into water if it doesn't attach to a root
[SPEAKER_00]: does that sound like there's any truth in
that or maybe it's not quite correct well
[SPEAKER_05]: the first thing there's a lot of
mycorrhizae product water-based on the
[SPEAKER_05]: market and if you see a mycorrhizae
product that is water-based and that is on
[SPEAKER_05]: a shelf and not like a lower like say
let's say four degrees temperature that is
[SPEAKER_05]: basically won't work you know in water
form it's way like I said earlier are
[SPEAKER_05]: there to keep this viable spores dormant
so if they get activated they like I said
[SPEAKER_05]: they eventually gonna die because they
won't be able to connect with any type of
[SPEAKER_05]: roots so it's a bit more tricky when
having a formulation water-based
[SPEAKER_00]: formulation yeah okay sure and I guess it
probably just varies from brand to brand
[SPEAKER_00]: as to how long the spores would be viable
in that situation yeah definitely and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: also depend on the application you know if
you're having a powder form that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: mixing with water right away and you are
playing directly on the roots you won't
[SPEAKER_05]: have time to die you know because you're
using the product right away I'm more
[SPEAKER_05]: talking into like a shelf life situation
okay yeah no that that makes sense for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure so a lot of the people listening to
the show utilize a style of growing called
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till where the idea is you're trying
not to disturb the soil as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible and just sort of taking out the
stump of the old root putting a new one in
[SPEAKER_00]: does that sort of environment lead to any
benefits with the mycorrhizae because the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil sort of their long term or because
the roots are in this cycle of like being
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and then dying off and then new
roots is it sort of like you're just
[SPEAKER_05]: starting fresh in a sense each time if I'm
understanding correctly you meaning you're
[SPEAKER_05]: like reusing the same salt yeah Kendra's
right okay okay well if you're using
[SPEAKER_05]: mycorrhizae already and you're keeping the
roots in there there's still going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: some mycorrhizae and spore left because
you know when mycorrhizae grow on roots it
[SPEAKER_05]: creates spores or physical and stuff that
is able to reconnect eventually with an
[SPEAKER_05]: alive root system but at the same time
reusing your soil is always a tricky
[SPEAKER_05]: business because you know for example
you're purchasing pro mix for the porosity
[SPEAKER_05]: you know the structure of the soil that is
provided and you know the stability of the
[SPEAKER_05]: pH and stuff like that but that's
something that over time you're you're
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna lose because there's compaction you
know the fiber of the peds gonna get
[SPEAKER_05]: degraded all of those stuff that's gonna
come into play as well okay sure yeah so I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess it sort of would be a bit of a
challenging undertaking for someone to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to like reuse the same pot just again and
again again just to try to like get their
[SPEAKER_05]: own mycorrhizae right yes and no like I
mean I may be more talking to like a
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial business type of thing but if
you're like trying some stuff at home like
[SPEAKER_05]: craft cannabis and trying new things
there's you know you can try whatever you
[SPEAKER_05]: want and see see how it goes I seen people
doing so much different thing and I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: having success you know it's not because
personally me I'm not doing it that is not
[SPEAKER_05]: good but I see it may be difficult to do
it like you know commercial scales but you
[SPEAKER_05]: know if you're growing for fun at home
definitely you can try it something I had
[SPEAKER_00]: always wondered was you often hear about
foods for microbes be it bacterial or
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal is there any food you can give to
help make your mycorrhizae more happy so
[SPEAKER_05]: to speak not really I would say because
you know bacillus and bacteria are able to
[SPEAKER_05]: like get their food or their nutrients in
the soil you know so that would be like
[SPEAKER_05]: for for bacteria like yeah could you can
apply some stuff that will help their
[SPEAKER_05]: development but you know to develop itself
mycorrhizae just need to plant that's what
[SPEAKER_05]: they get their nutrient their energy from
the plant so even if you are adding any
[SPEAKER_05]: type of you know sugar or stuff into your
your agrimedia if it benefit the
[SPEAKER_05]: mycorrhizae is because it's gonna benefit
the plant and not directly the mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah okay but I mean that's sort of in
line with the principle organic growers
[SPEAKER_00]: use anyway feeding the soil not the plant
so I guess it's the same with the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae yeah exactly as far as you're
aware are there any factors which can
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the efficiency of the mycorrhizae
once it's been applied to the plant well
[SPEAKER_05]: we've touched point on that earlier but I
definitely like the amount of phosphorus
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're applying right after it I
would say like to low down below 20 ppm
[SPEAKER_05]: would be like a recommendation to ensure
that the symbiosis get going more easily
[SPEAKER_00]: and faster yeah okay sure I guess I'm sort
of thinking like do mycorrhizae favor any
[SPEAKER_00]: particular medium composition over others
or it's all pretty much effective of
[SPEAKER_00]: similar proportion no matter what medium
you're in to be totally honest with you I
[SPEAKER_05]: feel like it's gonna work well in any type
of environment because you know
[SPEAKER_05]: mycorrhizae also be known to help the
structure of the soil it's such a small
[SPEAKER_05]: structure that pretty much any type of
soil that it's in is gonna thrive and
[SPEAKER_05]: develop itself really easily you know
compaction is not really an obstacle for
[SPEAKER_05]: mycorrhizae so I would say it's gonna
thrive in pretty much all all those
[SPEAKER_00]: environment okay sure I've been doing a
lot of reading about the ProMix Connect
[SPEAKER_00]: product and I guess I'm sort of wondering
are there any specifics about it or the
[SPEAKER_00]: production methods which you feel help set
it apart from others well we've talked
[SPEAKER_05]: earlier about the premier tech you know
using in in vitro technique which is a big
[SPEAKER_05]: part of our success you know we're in our
producing our mycorrhizae having full
[SPEAKER_05]: control of all the process from A to Z you
know a lot of brand out there are
[SPEAKER_05]: co-packing that are actually purchasing
mycorrhizae and just putting in a bag so
[SPEAKER_05]: of course you don't have the same control
as we have you know we've been doing that
[SPEAKER_05]: for so long now that we're really expert
into not only producing mycorrhizae but
[SPEAKER_05]: formulating mycorrhizae and not only that
but ProMix Connect has been developed
[SPEAKER_05]: exclusively with cannabis in mind and you
know when you deal with microbes and alive
[SPEAKER_05]: microorganism the first thing is need to
be viable they need to be alive and that's
[SPEAKER_05]: something that we guarantee we have 6,000
viable spores inside our product so
[SPEAKER_05]: there's nothing nothing dead in there so
you know what you're paying for and after
[SPEAKER_05]: that we guarantee the concentration 6,000
thousand viable spores is by far the most
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrated product out there there's not
even someone that is coming close so
[SPEAKER_05]: having a higher concentration you know you
have a better chance to get the symbiosis
[SPEAKER_05]: established quickly so better benefit at
the end as well and the last thing we've
[SPEAKER_05]: developed it as a wetable potter because
cannabis is such a short crop you know you
[SPEAKER_05]: want the symbiosis to get going fast so
you have a concentrated product that it's
[SPEAKER_05]: alive and close to the root system as a
wetable potter yeah okay I think in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past I had read some sort of different
units used I think it might have been like
[SPEAKER_00]: BTU or something like that and they're
talking in the billions or the thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: are there different sort of units used to
sort of measure the activity of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product or it's all standardized in like
the spore count I would like it to be
[SPEAKER_05]: standardized but it really isn't most
mycorrhizae product out there are listed
[SPEAKER_05]: as Propagil which isn't necessarily a bad
thing Propagil is a real term you know but
[SPEAKER_05]: Propagil stands for any part of the fungi
that may connect with the root system
[SPEAKER_05]: eventually but at the same time that could
be an eye feed it could be a root fragment
[SPEAKER_05]: with some physical you know it could be an
unviable spores and all of that is counted
[SPEAKER_05]: into the concentration of the product but
at the end of the day none of those
[SPEAKER_05]: structures gonna have an impact on on the
plant only viable spores are able to
[SPEAKER_05]: efficiently colonize the roots so that's
why we don't even count those in promise
[SPEAKER_05]: connect it's strictly 6,000 viable spores
and you can often see product out there
[SPEAKER_05]: let's say for example 500 proper goals per
gram but at the end of the day you end up
[SPEAKER_05]: having like 50 10 viable spores in inside
per gram so you know we would like to get
[SPEAKER_05]: more education out there about mycorrhizae
you know viable spores versus proper goals
[SPEAKER_05]: because definitely it make a big
difference between two products yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess if someone had used mycorrhizae in
the past and they hadn't felt like they
[SPEAKER_00]: got particularly good benefit from it
maybe they just need a try again with
[SPEAKER_00]: something with a bit more guaranteed
activity in the box you think yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely you know there's a lot of
product out there I don't want to do any
[SPEAKER_05]: name drop or anything but you know the
viability of the product is just isn't
[SPEAKER_05]: there each and every year Permatech we
test every product on the market and you
[SPEAKER_05]: know the viability of the product is just
everywhere all over the place it's it's
[SPEAKER_05]: it's really rare that a product came up
with the same claim as as it says on the
[SPEAKER_05]: packaging so I would definitely say to try
you know a product that guarantee the
[SPEAKER_00]: viability of their spores yeah okay good
stuff good stuff so I mean I guess I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering if you were trying to sort of
describe to someone mycorrhizae who you
[SPEAKER_00]: know not so familiar with the ins and outs
of it and they're just sort of looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: the major points how would you describe
the major benefits of using it you know
[SPEAKER_05]: it's all linked together of course because
you know you having you pick up nutrients
[SPEAKER_05]: and more water more easily but all the
benefits we're basically putting them in
[SPEAKER_05]: four categories it would say it would be
like LTR and Enhanced Root System first
[SPEAKER_05]: you know because having that IP network
helping the root system you're able to
[SPEAKER_05]: have like a bigger root mass you know
bigger nicest establishment of your root
[SPEAKER_05]: system and then you go at faster growth
and you know it make only sense since you
[SPEAKER_05]: pick it up nutrient and water easier
you're gonna be able to put more mass
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly and that's it's kind of a big deal
because being able to put more mass
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly you're able sometimes to shove a
couple of days of veg which in a
[SPEAKER_05]: commercial standpoint is a really really
useful useful thing after that I would say
[SPEAKER_05]: of course the increased crop yield you're
able to have a bigger structure and be
[SPEAKER_05]: most more energy available you're able to
produce you know bigger flower at the end
[SPEAKER_05]: and the last thing and in my mind the most
important is is higher quality
[SPEAKER_05]: consistently we've tested higher terpenes
content and and and cannabinoids yeah some
[SPEAKER_00]: really strong selling points there though
I think a lot of people who listen to this
[SPEAKER_00]: show are probably already quite avid fans
of mycorrhizas so it's now just time to
[SPEAKER_00]: get onto the ProMix train and see what
benefits it has in store something I was
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering given you guys are now doing the
ProMix connect is what is the the future
[SPEAKER_00]: of premier tech are there any sort of
fields you guys are thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: expanding into or is there a further step
with the mycorrhizal products you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go in where do you see yourself where do
you see the company going in the future
[SPEAKER_05]: well you know I would like to elaborate on
that but of course I cannot you know tell
[SPEAKER_05]: too much about it but you know ProMix has
always been a company about innovation and
[SPEAKER_05]: research so I can definitely tell you that
we're always working on something and I
[SPEAKER_05]: can tell you that we're specifically
working on something on cannabis we have a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of technologies available that
eventually we'll be able to maybe bring to
[SPEAKER_05]: the market so we're definitely working on
some stuff and I'm hoping to bring them to
[SPEAKER_00]: the market as soon as possible you know
exciting we'll have to keep our eyes open
[SPEAKER_00]: for that one I mean probably not going to
be too hard for people but where can
[SPEAKER_00]: people find ProMix connect if they're
looking to give it a try I can probably
[SPEAKER_05]: provide you with with the link we have a
landing page about the connect it listed
[SPEAKER_05]: all the address or that is available and
when we're also online with indoor growing
[SPEAKER_05]: Canada which is available all across
Canada as well and it probably in the US
[SPEAKER_05]: in the next couple of weeks so yeah pretty
much available all across North America oh
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic and I mean long term do you
expect that people will probably be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to find it in you know their sort of local
grow store or their best bet is just to go
[SPEAKER_05]: online get it shipped directly to them I
depend on your habits we're definitely not
[SPEAKER_05]: taking the hydro store out we want to
cater the hydro store spares because we
[SPEAKER_05]: still believe that it's a strong space to
be in but of course with everything that
[SPEAKER_05]: happened in Alaska the last year you know
e-commerce has come a long way so you know
[SPEAKER_05]: we're gonna try to be available on that
space as well sure and I mean for the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who like to go to the face-to-face
events when they resume back up do you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys have stalls there can people come and
ask you questions things like that you
[SPEAKER_05]: know we're gonna start to get more and
more out there you know the world's kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of starting again so we're at a lot of
shows throughout the years we're gonna you
[SPEAKER_05]: know be out there interacting with people
so yes I cannot in the top of my head tell
[SPEAKER_05]: you all the shows that we're gonna be in
but definitely we're gonna be out there
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah now that's good to hear hopefully
people can catch you at some of the shows
[SPEAKER_00]: and one of the final questions I have for
you is some of our listeners operate
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger size facilities and sort of you
know have those more serious operations do
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys provide different sizing are
there sort of bigger bundles available to
[SPEAKER_00]: people if they're looking to get like you
know a sort of substantially bigger size
[SPEAKER_05]: the biggest size that we have available is
2.5 kilogram which three they're around
[SPEAKER_05]: 700 plan depending on how you use it so
that's that's our biggest packaging but of
[SPEAKER_05]: course it's easier to go into like a
bigger bigger format for like let's say a
[SPEAKER_05]: big big big customer so we're open to
maybe having having something bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually so sort of in line with that
topic we were talking about earlier where
[SPEAKER_00]: you know some products advertise in
different units and their different sizes
[SPEAKER_00]: and different prices and it it can become
quite complex quite quickly do you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's an easy way to sort of judge
what is bringing value in terms of a
[SPEAKER_05]: mycorrhizal product yeah of course that
you know there's a lot of product out
[SPEAKER_05]: there so it's come confusing like very
quickly but the thing that you need to
[SPEAKER_05]: look at basically is the number of
valuable spores you know because a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: people out there are shopping a price for
a weight but at the end of the day you're
[SPEAKER_05]: not paying for a carrier you don't want to
pay for clay you're paying for mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_05]: and what bring value to the mycorrhizae is
the number of valuable spores so yeah some
[SPEAKER_05]: product like promix connect we know it
we're a high end product of course but I 6
[SPEAKER_05]: 000 viable spores when you take it into
account were kind of the most affordable
[SPEAKER_05]: mycorrhizae product out there based on the
concentration yeah that makes total sense
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that's just about everything I
had to ask you matt thanks so much for
[SPEAKER_00]: coming on the show were there any comments
shout outs anything you wanted to say you
[SPEAKER_05]: know we're we're trying to get more and
more involved with the community on our
[SPEAKER_05]: instagram so come interact with us on
promix cannabis and also myself on promix
[SPEAKER_05]: matt you know you are welcome to hit me on
my dms anytime so yeah that's pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: it amazing you know and thank you so much
to both yourself and everyone at promix
[SPEAKER_00]: who's on board with helping support the
show you know we really appreciate you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys being able to help us make the shows
happen and it was fantastic to have you on
[SPEAKER_00]: and get a rundown about all the ins and
outs of promix connect well I had a blast
[SPEAKER_05]: on your show and thank you for having me
maybe I'm gonna come back at some point
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you think guys some awesome
mycorrhizae knowledge there from matt at
[SPEAKER_00]: premier tech thanks so much again matt up
next we have kevin of kopit biological
[SPEAKER_00]: systems very grateful to have him on the
show let's jump straight into it gang
[SPEAKER_00]: alrighty so huge shout out and welcome to
one of the ipm specialists from kopit
[SPEAKER_00]: biological systems thank you so much kevin
for taking the time to join me today and
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk all things ipm oh thanks for
having me man not a problem at all how you
[SPEAKER_00]: doing today I'm doing good that's good to
hear that's good to hear so to start out I
[SPEAKER_00]: was hoping you might be able to give me a
little bit of background on yourself and
[SPEAKER_00]: how you ended up coming to work with kopit
I've always actually kind of grown I grew
[SPEAKER_01]: up in the greenhouse industry like in the
course I originally is from the commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental industry like work there since
I was like 15 and it's all I ever did is
[SPEAKER_01]: when I went to school for and then I used
to be a grower at a big commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and then I moved into some
other aspects of it and then I ended up at
[SPEAKER_01]: kopit about 15 years ago and they were
kind of always around in the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: there you know back in the day they
weren't quite as prevalent style controls
[SPEAKER_01]: one is commonly used but yeah when it
started to take off and it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: something that interests me so I switched
over to to working here wow that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a cool little story I mean it must
have been any interesting journey to sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of transition from you know like a non
cannabis related horticultural field to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of being more in the in the active
scene of the the cannabis related field
[SPEAKER_01]: have you enjoyed that so far yeah like
just to be clear I kind of grew up around
[SPEAKER_01]: both things I was always kind of involved
in the cannabis industry at the same time
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the involved in the early days in
the medical scene and in Canada and I used
[SPEAKER_01]: to work it used to be the cultivation
writer for cannabis culture magazine back
[SPEAKER_01]: this is back in like the 90s and then that
kind of had an equal footing both in the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial greenhouse part and and the
cannabis part as well yeah awesome okay
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah so quite a quite a depth of
experience you've already got under your
[SPEAKER_00]: belt so one of the things I wanted to sort
of start out chatting with all the place I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to start our discussion was sort of
the utility and the benefits of predator
[SPEAKER_00]: mites it's been something which for
example in Australia has only recently
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of come to light whereas I'm sure in
places like Canada and America where the
[SPEAKER_00]: technology has been established they're a
bit longer probably more aware of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot but I guess something I'd love to
talk about starting out is how would you
[SPEAKER_00]: describe predator mites and what would be
sort of a sales pitch for someone who's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit on the fence and not quite sure how to
use them or what they're used for yeah I
[SPEAKER_01]: think the first thing is that I think
maybe what people don't realize is how
[SPEAKER_01]: long they've actually been used for so
they everyone a lot of the people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry they kind of seem to
think that it's like this new thing when
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis started but it's really been
going on like since the 80s at least in
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial vegetables it wasn't in
ornamentals up until somewhat more recent
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was always just not an organic
vegetables isn't like conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables it's always been a standard and
in the last like I said I've been here 15
[SPEAKER_01]: years and probably most of the time I've
been here it was also ornamentals that
[SPEAKER_01]: became a standard so cannabis is kind of
the last thing so it's a very well proven
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy and most of the most of our
customers like a lot of people think that
[SPEAKER_01]: bio controls is something that it's like a
cosmetic type of thing or makes you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: good that you're doing it but most of our
customers are actually like conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: ag that they're not organic or anything
they just use it because it's actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: really good cost effective solution but
they use it in combination with you know
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides or or other other strategies
that's a really brilliant point the
[SPEAKER_00]: utility of predators across multiple
different systems I guess a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: who follow the organic principles of
growing are generally sort of interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in this sort of holistic style of
management and whatnot how best should
[SPEAKER_00]: people apply predator mites I've always
sort of advocated to people that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: if you imagine you're a city and your
city's under attack you kind of want to
[SPEAKER_00]: have the army already there ready to go to
help defend you rather than having to
[SPEAKER_00]: muster it up once you're under attack and
you know everything's on fire and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of an issue do you agree with that do
you think people should sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: prophylactically be using predator mites
to help mitigate any potential issues or
[SPEAKER_00]: do you more advocate to use them when
required definitely proactively but you
[SPEAKER_01]: can also use them like through it at least
so I'd say the real answer is it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: combination you want to have them in the
crop but you'd usually need to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: switch gears into different predator mites
when you get a situation so for instance
[SPEAKER_01]: like kind of a standard in cannabis is
generally people are picking kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: generalist predator is kind of like their
base so that would be typically swirly or
[SPEAKER_01]: kookamaris and it's a predator might that
it's a generous where it can eat a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different stuff but it's primarily focused
like its preference is trips which is
[SPEAKER_01]: generally on cannabis kind of the main
pest so you're kind of working from that
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you stack other stuff on top if
you have the issues so sorry they would
[SPEAKER_01]: source key or kookamaris would kind of be
the base and then if you're in a garden
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know consistently has like spider
mite problems that you're expecting then
[SPEAKER_01]: we would put in spy cow which is the tree
name but it's californicus and that's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of for spider mites it's like a
preventative level but then for instance
[SPEAKER_01]: if you get spider mites kind of raging a
little bit you need to move over to spidex
[SPEAKER_01]: which is persimilis so they've all got
kind of their own little niche so a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about starting off preventatively and
stacking them accordingly yeah that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a great point you make there and it
sort of segues into the next question I
[SPEAKER_00]: had for you which was that if you look on
the website there's really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: information about the different predators
what they can be used to combat a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of interesting and wonderful extra
bits of information and something I
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed which you sort of just touched on
is that there can be a bit of overlap you
[SPEAKER_00]: know you read different predators and
maybe a commonality between a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different ones you read about is that
they're all good for aphids for example so
[SPEAKER_00]: my question would be how would you go
about selecting the product to use if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're seeing a few of them that all
covering aphids for example are you safe
[SPEAKER_00]: with any of them is there a way in which
you might figure out one maybe out edge is
[SPEAKER_00]: the others a little better for your
situation how would you go about choosing
[SPEAKER_01]: that so when you get into aphids in
particular that's probably for sure the
[SPEAKER_01]: most tricky one when it comes to anything
especially cannabis because that's one
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're the controls are very like
the predators are very specific to the
[SPEAKER_01]: type of aphids so the absolute first thing
you need to do is actually ID what type of
[SPEAKER_01]: aphid you're dealing with most of the time
and also there's a couple of caveats it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a it's a big box the aphid control thing
so if you're using parasitoids which is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of our usually our standard approach
on most crops so a parasitoid is like a
[SPEAKER_01]: wasp not like a wasp it's stingy just a
parasitic wasp like kind of maybe as big
[SPEAKER_01]: as a mosquito or something and what it
does is it's really good at searching the
[SPEAKER_01]: crops it'll fly the crop and it's smelling
out aphids and when it finds an aphid it
[SPEAKER_01]: lays its egg in the aphid and makes what's
called a mummy so and then instead of the
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids so the aphid slowly dies the
parasite takes over and at the end another
[SPEAKER_01]: parasite hatches out at the aphid so
that's usually our standard because it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice thing to keep going in your
crop because you only just you know for
[SPEAKER_01]: every one aphid you know for one bio
control you put out there i'm just making
[SPEAKER_01]: up a number i don't know how many is but
let's say it's 40 aphids that it
[SPEAKER_01]: parasitizes so for every one aphid you put
in you're actually getting 40 back you
[SPEAKER_01]: know the first two weeks later and then
all of those go and lay eggs themselves so
[SPEAKER_01]: it really builds an army in the crop so
for that those parasites are very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: so for instance if you're dealing with
like cannabis aphid the one this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: three main parasitoids and we found one of
them works a lot better on cannabis aphids
[SPEAKER_01]: once it's called the aphipar-m which is
the Phidias matricaria ervy works as well
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly well and then comani doesn't work
comani is another parasite doesn't work
[SPEAKER_01]: hardly at all so you really have to be
very specific because if you go at it with
[SPEAKER_01]: the wrong parasite it'll literally do
nothing so we kind of go at it from a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of approaches so that's the
parasitic wasp is kind of the more
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional approach and then you've got
like a completely different approach which
[SPEAKER_01]: would be more like a predator bug so
that's what when people think about
[SPEAKER_01]: ladybugs that's what a ladybug is just
like actually eating the the aphid we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't use the ladybugs too much but we use
a lot of lay swings in cannabis so the you
[SPEAKER_01]: know the advantage on cannabis i guess in
some situations is that the lace wings are
[SPEAKER_01]: eating eight eight they're
indiscriminately so you don't have to id
[SPEAKER_01]: the aphid anymore it's just going to eat
whatever it sees and it also doesn't leave
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids in the crop which sometimes
parasitoids because they're leaving that
[SPEAKER_01]: little you know a zombie mummy is still
there you can get some crop contamination
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially so the lace wing is just
eating it completely you don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: worry about id-ing it but the downside is
in order for a lace wing to reproduce
[SPEAKER_01]: where a parasitic wasp only needs one
aphid a lace wing needs again i'm making
[SPEAKER_01]: them i'm not i don't have all these
numbers memorized but let's say it needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to eat 20 aphids to get enough protein to
reproduce so a lot of the time it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting 20 aphids so it's it's not really
reproducing so you're just kind of putting
[SPEAKER_01]: it in almost like a pesticide you put it
out it crawls around eats a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids and then it dies so it's still
thing no matter what you're always really
[SPEAKER_01]: the most important thing of aphid control
is id-ing the aphid and a lot of times
[SPEAKER_01]: from that you really need to talk to an
expert like a biocontrol company or
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody like that that can an
entomologist that can actually say no
[SPEAKER_01]: that's cannabis aphid or whatever that's
always like the first step in most pest
[SPEAKER_01]: control make sure you actually know what
you're dealing with yeah brilliant answer
[SPEAKER_00]: and you you sort of raised two really good
avenues i'd love to pursue a little more i
[SPEAKER_00]: mean just on the end there you mentioned
the cannabis aphid which some people will
[SPEAKER_00]: probably be aware of but yeah over the
past few years we've seen the emergence of
[SPEAKER_00]: this new sort of aphid which seems
specific for cannabis i guess the question
[SPEAKER_00]: is do you think that it's inevitable as a
cannabis community so to speak that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to sort of inadvertently cause the
development of new and resistant bugs over
[SPEAKER_01]: time yeah i mean that's an interesting one
because like i said i've been around the
[SPEAKER_01]: canvass industry for like 30 years and
that really appeared in canada exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: when we legally realized and the
difference was there i'm sure it was
[SPEAKER_01]: around but i mean it's really just spread
almost 100 just by trading of cuttings and
[SPEAKER_01]: i think it just wasn't that kind of trade
in the old black market days of vegetative
[SPEAKER_01]: material like it was traded amongst like
crews and stuff like that you know like
[SPEAKER_01]: groups but they wasn't traded like wide
scale and that's what we saw as soon as
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that lp market got established in
canada it just both cannabis aphid and
[SPEAKER_01]: rude aphid just blew up and almost i would
i honestly never even heard of it before
[SPEAKER_01]: probably i don't know whatever that
happened seven years ago or something and
[SPEAKER_01]: now it's probably one of the biggest pests
in canada in canada so i think the opening
[SPEAKER_01]: of markets really can be a big vector for
that because a lot of these are you've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen the same thing with the obsolete and
virus where you know it's really just
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere and now it's another one that
probably barely existed before because
[SPEAKER_01]: there wasn't that much trading of clones
but back in the old days yeah that
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly makes sense i mean just to take
one more step maybe towards sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: more you know quote conspiracy theory
stuff i remember in the past i used to
[SPEAKER_00]: read people talking about how they used to
think that the u.s government was
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing mites on the side of the road
and stuff to to combat sort of vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and i always thought that sounded a
bit far-fetched and then i found a
[SPEAKER_00]: document one day which said like maybe
they're actually doing that and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: contributed to like these mites getting
then on cannabis plants and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that have you ever heard or read anything
like that i have and it i would say it's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably not as crazy as it sounds because
i've been growing up in like the 1980s i
[SPEAKER_01]: remember like i've never seen anything to
say that was the case and i'd personally
[SPEAKER_01]: lean away from that being the case but i
mean if you were around back in the 80s or
[SPEAKER_01]: i think it was early 90s i mean the dea
100 was releasing fusarium into cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: crops in other countries i think there's a
fair bit of evidence they probably
[SPEAKER_01]: released it into humboldt like in the you
know concentrated cannabis areas so i mean
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not unheard of like that that for
sure using you know introducing pests or
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases to control cannabis is a real
thing like that's 100 verify well the dea
[SPEAKER_01]: did do that if you look both for cannabis
and cocaine you can look if you google if
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone wants to google that i mean there's
a ton of evidence that that happened down
[SPEAKER_01]: in columbia and elsewhere um the russet so
i mean could they do something like that i
[SPEAKER_01]: personally doubt it because i mean at the
time it wasn't really something like a
[SPEAKER_01]: russet mite wasn't really something that
was likely to spread like that especially
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the black market days because the
said people just weren't the only way
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to really spread that around
is by trading cuttings and uh i personally
[SPEAKER_01]: doubt it i think it's probably like most
crops crop pests where if i had to look
[SPEAKER_01]: into russet might it seems like it kind of
emerged probably out of california i know
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of that similar type of
might on uh you know and when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about hemp russet might that's for
sure a real thing whether that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of what we're seeing nobody knows
because that's that type of might is
[SPEAKER_01]: called a tersonomid mite and it's like a
cyclamen mite a broad mite they're all in
[SPEAKER_01]: that type of class tiny little mite nobody
knows that much about them so for sure
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp russet might is a real thing whether
that's that is a hundred percent of all
[SPEAKER_01]: that type of mites we see on cannabis or
one percent i don't think anybody really
[SPEAKER_01]: knows so if it was hemp russet might i
would assume it must have had to come from
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp at some point i don't know the
details but if it's some of those other
[SPEAKER_01]: ones it could have come from like for
instance grapes where they get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: that or um fruit crops where they get a
lot of that type of tersonomid might you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and what happens is that i noticed
from where i live is there's a lot of it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a really intensive agriculture so you'll
get like let's say corn growing right
[SPEAKER_01]: beside a greenhouse that's full of
tomatoes and there'll be one pest on the
[SPEAKER_01]: corn that never and this is even though
the corn is only you know 10 feet away
[SPEAKER_01]: from the tomatoes they've got they don't
the thrips that's on the corn isn't on the
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes but eventually sometimes that
jumps so what will happen is you know one
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips will just be a little bit more
genetically adapted to tomatoes you know
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're you know there's a bazillion
thrips landing on those tomatoes from the
[SPEAKER_01]: corn every year sooner or later you get a
couple that are more genetically adapted
[SPEAKER_01]: to that crop they start reproducing and
bang all of a sudden i've seen that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: got a tomato thrips in my town so i think
it's more likely something like that where
[SPEAKER_01]: you know some guy was you know growing og
beside a vineyard and and got some mites
[SPEAKER_01]: in from there but i mean who knows never
underestimate the dea no that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: some good insight i like that explanation
it's probably yeah some sort of blend of
[SPEAKER_00]: the two just to jump back to something you
mentioned earlier when i first heard about
[SPEAKER_00]: predators i remember in every conversation
i had people were just like ladybugs
[SPEAKER_00]: ladybugs ladybugs and i guess as time's
gone by i've sort of heard less and less
[SPEAKER_00]: about them i also remember that uh prag
mantises were like also you know in that
[SPEAKER_00]: uh top tier echelon of predators with
ladybugs my question is in reality do
[SPEAKER_00]: these predators provide you know really
effective cover that people talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: because i think when you look up online
you know the little tables which show you
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what bugs get eaten by what
ladybugs and praying mantises are often
[SPEAKER_00]: toted as you know they'll eat everything
they just like the cure all do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's maybe not quite the reality of the
situation um yeah so praying mantises i
[SPEAKER_01]: would just you can flat out say they're
really not a tool they're a cool thing if
[SPEAKER_01]: you just want to be a praying mantis
wandering around in your garden and it
[SPEAKER_01]: will eat some pests other than that i
would say as far as i would be aware it
[SPEAKER_01]: has absolutely no place in your garden um
the reason for praying mantis is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: simple so it's a lot of what goes on with
biocontrol is how what the numeric
[SPEAKER_01]: response is to the pest so how quickly
that biocontrol reper because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: control isn't coming necessarily from your
releasing it's coming from what you
[SPEAKER_01]: release building up in the crop like
reproducing so something like for instance
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say let's say spider mites so if you
were to use persimilus which is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the main thing that people use for spider
mite i think the life cycle reproduction
[SPEAKER_01]: is like seven days or something like that
so every seven days you're getting a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: new round of persimilus in your crop well
praying mantis i believe it's like once a
[SPEAKER_01]: year maybe it's twice a year i don't know
i don't know so really what you're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: is just that one praying mantis you put in
so that's kind of one of the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: people really miss when it comes to that
stuff and then ladybugs is a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more complicated where i think ladybugs is
unfortunately the first thing people think
[SPEAKER_01]: of when they think about biocontrol and it
is really one of the least like outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry ladybugs basically
aren't even talked about they're almost a
[SPEAKER_01]: non-issue and that's kind of for a
different reason so again we go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: people are saying oh they're great they're
generalists but that's a lot of the time
[SPEAKER_01]: what you don't really want what you need
is like something that's just focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: eating your pests that you have otherwise
you can get um weird stuff like i've
[SPEAKER_01]: actually seen this for instance on some
other um things uh once with one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: predatory mics that was a kind of a
generalist is sometimes they've got tray
[SPEAKER_01]: preferences so we for instance put
something in for thrips and there was also
[SPEAKER_01]: whitefly and it just really liked eating
whitefly and the thrips went from almost
[SPEAKER_01]: no thrips to taking down the crop while
this predator was just eating whiteflies
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't happen all the time but that's
kind of like when you're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: ladybugs you never know really what
they're going to do but mostly ladybugs
[SPEAKER_01]: they're they're they are a generous but
mostly they're focused on aphids so where
[SPEAKER_01]: that um where they're typically used again
again none of this is really new right
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been using bio control on vegetable
crops for a long long long time at the
[SPEAKER_01]: standard so it's very dialed in like which
bios have which place in the program so
[SPEAKER_01]: where ladybugs are traditionally used like
their strength is they're really good at
[SPEAKER_01]: like cleaning up a nasty hot spot so we
would for instance have these a lot in
[SPEAKER_01]: peppers or not a lot but sometimes um so
peppers you would use parasitic wasps
[SPEAKER_01]: generally to control your aphids that's
kind of like your first plan um because
[SPEAKER_01]: like i said before because they're late
you know you only need one aphid to
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduce so they're really good for
cycling themselves in the crop so they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to keep introducing them so we
kind of use that then we use something
[SPEAKER_01]: called aphid end which is like a bulmage
so that kind of is more for working more
[SPEAKER_01]: on hot spots so how a bulmage works is it
will instead of laying its eggs in the in
[SPEAKER_01]: the pest like a parasitic wasp will it
lays its eggs underneath it so what it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: do is find a real nasty hot spot lay a
bunch of eggs in the hot spot and then
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the larval stage that eats the aphids
so it's kind of a bit better in hot spots
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's kind of our backbone of the
program is the parasitic wasp so if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking cannabis it would probably be um
aphid bar m so aphidius matricaria and
[SPEAKER_01]: then in some situations we might use um
aphidalides and then if you had a hot spot
[SPEAKER_01]: you would use something like we usually
use lacewings but you could also use
[SPEAKER_01]: ladybugs just to clean up that hot spot
which would be a very small amount because
[SPEAKER_01]: the the where where ladybugs outshine some
of the other bio controls is for instance
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids they poop out like a honeydew so
when they're eating all the plants they
[SPEAKER_01]: they're constantly excreting this kind of
sticky substance um which is just their
[SPEAKER_01]: excretement and that kind of if you ever
see like a nasty aphid swat the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: plant will kind of glisten and it's this
honeydew that they're secreting well that
[SPEAKER_01]: honeydew a lot of the bio controls don't
like because they've got to like they get
[SPEAKER_01]: it on them and they got to spend all their
time cleaning the honeydew off instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: actually cleaning up your pest but
ladybugs and others and lacewings they
[SPEAKER_01]: like it like they're they just get right
in there so other bio controls don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really get into those really nasty hot
spots but ladybugs or lacewings do so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of your place but for the
average like honestly if i was a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial cannabis place i honestly
wouldn't even use that like not that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's little how little i think they
actually have a place no what a brilliant
[SPEAKER_00]: explanation you've helped me to sort of
piece together many of the little thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: i've had about ladybugs over the years so
that that's great thank you so much and
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of another topic which i often hear
raised in the discussion of ipm is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's often only regularly discussed by the
people i talk to who are sort of indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: but now that there's a much bigger growing
market of people who are able to venture
[SPEAKER_00]: into the outdoor because of changing
legalities in their local areas things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that i guess it sort of raises the
question of how do you make selections
[SPEAKER_00]: between the use of predators in indoor
versus outdoor and i guess the primary
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect i'm interested in is that whenever
i talk to people about using it in
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors there's sort of this perception
that the bugs will just disappear into the
[SPEAKER_00]: local environment whereas indoor you know
like it's in a tent and they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay there so to speak do you think that's
a bit of a misconception are you able to
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively use predators outdoors it's
not a misconception it's not entirely true
[SPEAKER_01]: so the so basically it depends on which
predator you're using so if any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: predator might you can definitely use them
outdoors they've been used like i said one
[SPEAKER_01]: of our some of our largest you know
business through time has been in outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberries like in california and
florida that's been standard for decades
[SPEAKER_01]: using predator mites outdoors for um broad
might and um spider mite control so
[SPEAKER_01]: predator mites they can't fly right so
they're stuck wherever you put them so you
[SPEAKER_01]: might have a predator mite that doesn't
like the environment and doesn't do very
[SPEAKER_01]: well in it but generally if you put a
predator mite that does well in that
[SPEAKER_01]: environment um they do fine they're not
going anywhere you don't need to worry
[SPEAKER_01]: about that so that's definitely not true
when it comes to predator mites you can
[SPEAKER_01]: use them exactly how you're going to use
them indoors and if the environment is
[SPEAKER_01]: correct for them they're fine when you get
into some of the flying um predators then
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a very different story which i
would say nobody anyone that tells you
[SPEAKER_01]: they know exactly what the answer is to
that i would say they're probably full of
[SPEAKER_01]: it um so there's a there's a lot of stuff
going on out there so how a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: predators um like paracetamol and stuff
work is they actually smell um when when
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are under attack they actually kind
of let off like a pheromone type of thing
[SPEAKER_01]: so there's like a scent plume coming from
um let's say you got a haze plant that's
[SPEAKER_01]: got whatever aphids or spider mites it's
letting off a plume of this like alarm
[SPEAKER_01]: scent um which is there to attract um
predators and some predators are very
[SPEAKER_01]: tuned to that so they will you know follow
that plume which can travel for really a
[SPEAKER_01]: long way and that's how they find the
pests that they need to feed on so the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem is when you're going outside let's
say you know you've got an aphid you're
[SPEAKER_01]: releasing something for aphids well are
they attracted to you know they might get
[SPEAKER_01]: distracted by you know the scent plume
coming from a tree in the nearby field or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe not like i said so nobody really
knows like i've definitely seen outdoors
[SPEAKER_01]: in in uh cannabis and other crops where
that type of stuff did work i think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just it's kind of hit or miss you really
don't know so you could release something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to fly into an aphid spot and
then they're you know just spreading
[SPEAKER_01]: around your crop or they might like some
other aphid species it's just a really
[SPEAKER_01]: they might like some other aphid species
on a different crop better it's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: really complex subject that i don't think
anybody really knows so the other thing
[SPEAKER_01]: with outdoors is the pest dynamic is very
different at least in canada so we really
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have any of the pests that we're
dealing with like thrips really haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: proven to be an issue outdoors i haven't
really seen spider mites be an issue
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors i think they could be in some
environments when it's where it's drier
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe i've seen a little bit of rust at my
but basically a lot of the pest dynamic is
[SPEAKER_01]: just completely different than what like
there's not necessarily a biocontrol
[SPEAKER_01]: solution so the main thing that we've been
doing on outdoor cannabis is actually lace
[SPEAKER_01]: wings because the other thing you get into
outdoors it's a lot lower value crop in
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in canada most of it's just
going into the extract market so first of
[SPEAKER_01]: all they've got a higher tolerance for
pest levels because they're just turning
[SPEAKER_01]: into isolate or something and and you also
get natural predators are coming in too
[SPEAKER_01]: right so out there the kind of strategy
that we've seen is like the biggest issue
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've seen that we actually have a
solution for is cannabis aphid and usually
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a self-induced condition where
people have had cannabis aphid on their
[SPEAKER_01]: clones that they put in that they had
inside and then they put them outside and
[SPEAKER_01]: big surprise you know you got cannabis
aphid outside so what we've kind of been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing is seeding with lacewing eggs so
lacewing eggs are kind of an inexpensive
[SPEAKER_01]: version of lacewings and we kind of seed
the whole crop a couple of times with
[SPEAKER_01]: lacewing eggs with the idea that even
though lacewings are probably going to
[SPEAKER_01]: show up naturally outdoors they might not
show up until like august where we can put
[SPEAKER_01]: them in june 1st and then they start
cycling in the crop earlier and that seems
[SPEAKER_01]: to be i mean it makes sense from a science
level and it seems to have worked but a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the outdoor stuff on cannabis is
really really it's uncharted territory
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah fantastic response and yeah it seems
like a good way to sort of you know
[SPEAKER_00]: control aphid problems outside it makes me
think you know there's so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of predators and there's many
different formulation types be it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes it's you know maybe predators
spread amongst vermiculite i've had
[SPEAKER_00]: predators arrive that are sort of on
actively on the leaves of another product
[SPEAKER_00]: and ready to jump on to your crop things
like that you get sachets how do you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the best one for you in any given
situation um the best one and for most
[SPEAKER_01]: situations is usually sachets so the
sachets are kind of like the evolution i
[SPEAKER_01]: think a lot of people don't get it's like
the evolution of bio controls it all kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of started off on bean leaves for instance
that that for instance persimilis so
[SPEAKER_01]: persimilis started off by being reared on
bean leaves and people would sell you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you get a bean leaf with some persimilis
on it it's also usually got some spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mites on it because by default you have to
have spider mites there and you and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes some other pests so then from
there that evolved into having whole
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses where they would rear a crop
it's usually done on bean plants and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they would have infested with spider mites
then they would infest that with
[SPEAKER_01]: persimilis and then there's a special
extraction technique where you can
[SPEAKER_01]: basically vacuum off the just the
persimilis and leave the spider mites
[SPEAKER_01]: behind so and then the latest technology
which which we've just developed this year
[SPEAKER_01]: is rearing it on a fictitious host so
something other than fictitious host just
[SPEAKER_01]: means something other than its natural
prey source so we just figured out that
[SPEAKER_01]: this year is how to do that so then you
don't have any risk of introducing spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mites you it's a lot more standardized
production and you can actually get better
[SPEAKER_01]: results because you can ship them with
food so they've got a higher frugality
[SPEAKER_01]: which means they can lay more eggs in the
crop so anytime when you're buying stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: on bean leaves you're like going back a
couple of decades so kind of the evolution
[SPEAKER_01]: was bean leaves with on the in the case of
persimilis or other stuff would have been
[SPEAKER_01]: for other types of mites like for instance
kukumaris or swirski there or californicus
[SPEAKER_01]: they're reared on a fictitious host so
it's usually a bran mite which is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like a it's just a mite that feeds on bran
and basically they're reared in climate
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms with bran then the bran mite that's
eating the bran and then the swirski or
[SPEAKER_01]: the kukumaris is eating the feeder mite so
kind of the first you know wave of
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrol was just selling that loose so
you'd buy the bran with the feeder mite
[SPEAKER_01]: and the swirski on it the vermiculite
they're talking was actually evolved from
[SPEAKER_01]: that so vermiculite is a way to get rid of
the feeder mites so some crops are really
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive to those feeder mites they can
damage certain crops so they would filter
[SPEAKER_01]: the feeder mites out and put them on
vermiculite so there is no food source for
[SPEAKER_01]: the feeder mite so that's really the only
reason to use something on vermiculite for
[SPEAKER_01]: predator mites is different with other
with other bios would be if you've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: crop that's sensitive to feeder mites
which cannabis isn't and we don't even use
[SPEAKER_01]: that type of feeder might that causes
damage anymore or for ornamentals where
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want the carrier like let's say
you're growing poinsettias or cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: would be the same let's say you're putting
a loose application of bran on your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and then maybe you're doing a
foliar spray well that sticks that bran
[SPEAKER_01]: like glue to your leaf or your butt or
whatever and then a lot of times it molds
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's like a contamination issue so it
was traditionally ornamental growers would
[SPEAKER_01]: use that vermiculite product so it didn't
stick to the plant so then the final
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution was the sachet so what a sachet
is it's basically taking that breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: system the bran the bran mites and the
feeder and the actual predator might you
[SPEAKER_01]: want and putting it into basically a
little envelope that kind of keeps the
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity up in it so it keeps like a
breeding system going so your rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: if you put loose material in your crop
you're just getting whatever was in that
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle and then whatever reproduces in the
crop with sachets it's releasing like for
[SPEAKER_01]: instance the regular sachets that we would
use in cannabis usually last about four
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks so they're constantly releasing
predator mites into the crop so that's for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure always the vast majority of cases
sachets are hands down the better way to
[SPEAKER_01]: go you don't get contamination of material
into your crop because it's contained in
[SPEAKER_01]: the sachet it's far cheaper because it's
breeding it itself and you're just getting
[SPEAKER_01]: a continued release and the other reason
is what specifically on cannabis why the
[SPEAKER_01]: sachets are really a good idea is because
in order for predator mites to reproduce
[SPEAKER_01]: they lay their eggs on specialized plant
hairs so kind of like a trichome and
[SPEAKER_01]: people with cannabis probably aren't you
know exactly what I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: because cannabis doesn't really have the
type of trichome that they like so imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: you know a cannabis it's got like the
glandular stalked trichome and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: think they're called capitate sessile ones
which is just like kind of like a little
[SPEAKER_01]: hair so they like to lay their eggs on
something similar to like a capitate
[SPEAKER_01]: sessile trichome it's just like a thin
plant hair and cannabis doesn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: have a lot of them it's like they're very
specific about the size and everything so
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say you don't get any
reproduction on cannabis but you get
[SPEAKER_01]: really low compared to a lot of plants
like a swarovski or cucumeris will
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduce way better on like a cucumber
plant or a pepper plant than it will on
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis so because it's not really
reproducing that well you really want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be having a constant source of them
releasing into your crop so that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: the sachets really are to me a hands down
because you hang in your crop once they're
[SPEAKER_01]: giving you continual release into the crop
for four weeks wow yeah really
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive answer and you touched on a
few things I'd love to segue into so that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's perfect and you know it's sort of
using the sachet innovation as a
[SPEAKER_00]: springboard something else I noticed that
you guys are doing really well with which
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really seen many other places in
terms of innovation is the the feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: sachets and I had a few questions around
them I guess most notably you know sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: at the forefront of my mind is are these
feeding sachets sort of something to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you bridge the current predator army
you've got to say you know a few weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead or are they able to be used sort of
indefinitely and if someone had purchased
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a reasonable size amount of
predators they might be able to sustain a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good percentage of that population
over the long term with regular feed
[SPEAKER_01]: sachet use we do have one type for
persimilis which is just a release sachet
[SPEAKER_01]: which is just it's literally just to stop
the carrier from getting in the crop if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in flower all the other ones are
breeding sachets so they've got the food
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything in there so they're that
that's what's happening is it's for all
[SPEAKER_01]: the food is in that sachet and it's like
it's a life it's a life cycle in there so
[SPEAKER_01]: the prey might it's cycling in there and
constantly coming out so there's no such
[SPEAKER_01]: thing as like a feeder sachet there is
like some sometimes we'll put in it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: a big part of the industry but there's two
things you can do on top of that which
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe I think you're maybe thinking of is
where you're actually putting some food in
[SPEAKER_01]: the crop for the predator mights to boost
the numbers so you can put we generally
[SPEAKER_01]: use again those feeder mites we'll just
sell bottles of just those feeder mites
[SPEAKER_01]: and put them in the crop and that works
because it's this feeder mites there's
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen and there's some other stuff like
like our team artemia which is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like a blind shrimp different feeding
sources I'm generally not a big believer
[SPEAKER_01]: in them on especially on cannabis because
they I don't find they're needed a ton on
[SPEAKER_01]: that crop and they also are a big source
of contaminants so to me I'm like when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're putting blind shrimp on something
like that yourself at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_01]: like somebody selling might have a
shellfish allergy I don't know but it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: source of potential contamination and the
same with pollen so all that pollen that
[SPEAKER_01]: people will use on it first of all it can
feed thrips so you're also feeding the
[SPEAKER_01]: past where so that's not a good thing okay
it's a complicated issue there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: situations where I'd say that is a good
idea most of the time I'd say no when why
[SPEAKER_01]: we prefer just using the feeder mites is
because it doesn't feed the pest so it
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritionally is a lot better for it to
eat protein than that like it's gonna make
[SPEAKER_01]: it reproduce better and then you don't
have to worry about a thrips thrips isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: any eat a feeder might so I think that's
maybe what you're thinking but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: also some other for some other bios
there's like cards and stuff that can hang
[SPEAKER_01]: in the crop I'm I said I personally not a
big believer it on with it on cannabis for
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of reasons the other thing you got
to remember with pollen is all that pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly comes from China and wherever it
comes from so it's it's cactail pollen and
[SPEAKER_01]: the pesticide residue not that they're
spraying it but like most stuff has
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide residue like maybe it's close to
an agricultural crop or whatever it goes
[SPEAKER_01]: through the water table so you never know
what you're actually introducing into your
[SPEAKER_01]: crop like when you're getting residue
testing if you're putting pollen out there
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and pollen quite often can have
pesticide residue in it on some level so I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that's probably what you're mistaken
but um yeah sachets is just generally a
[SPEAKER_01]: sachet is a breeding sachet and that's the
system on it though yeah no thank you for
[SPEAKER_00]: the clarification I think I had read about
brine shrimp when you were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah that you answered the question
nevertheless so thank you very much and I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean while we're on the topic of crop
contamination something I had heard from
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily soilless growers actually
whenever the topic of predators were
[SPEAKER_00]: raised was that it sort of always came
across as this sort of contrarian thing to
[SPEAKER_00]: say in my opinion but they would say oh
you know yeah predator mites but don't
[SPEAKER_00]: they just eat the bad predators and then
they still poo on the plan and then that's
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination blah blah blah I had never
really heard of this being a meaningful
[SPEAKER_00]: issue or something that had sort of been
considered a realistic detractant from
[SPEAKER_00]: using predators and then it also negates
the point that you've gotten rid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: infestation which is you know sort of the
number one goal what's your view on that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of opinion that even predators will
put excrement on the plant is it something
[SPEAKER_00]: you think there's any real merit to
worrying about or it's more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: superficial concern to a meaningful
solution to an actual bug infestation I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that would be another one that my
answer would be both it can be an issue
[SPEAKER_01]: it's I would say it's not generally an
issue it's like anything you have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff correctly if it's used correctly
it's a non-issue so I would first of all
[SPEAKER_01]: caveat like Canada for anyone like that's
not familiar with it's probably the most
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated cannabis market in the world
because it's always been regulated not
[SPEAKER_01]: always but since it's been legal it's been
regulated on a federal level by the
[SPEAKER_01]: government so it's it's honestly kind of
ridiculous how regulated the market is so
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is like as far as contaminants
we probably I would say we 100 have the
[SPEAKER_01]: most regulated market that comes from that
and it is essentially never come up the
[SPEAKER_01]: only time I have ever seen it come up
which was issues when it was both the pest
[SPEAKER_01]: there was pest in the crop that was
contaminating it and yes there was bios in
[SPEAKER_01]: the crop also that was eating the pest so
I'd say well does it really make a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference whether you've got spider mites
and persimilis in your contamination or
[SPEAKER_01]: just spider mites it's the same thing so
where I would so I'd say mostly it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: non-issue but I do think it is a potential
issue so I'd say if you've got pests in
[SPEAKER_01]: the crop anyways I don't think it really
makes any difference but a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cases like we're trying not to have pests
in there so that's when you really have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a strategy when you go about it so
the the issue with those sachets that you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be aware about so most stuff it's
not going to reproduce in the crop unless
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got a pest for instance like if you
put persimilis in a spider mite crop or in
[SPEAKER_01]: a spider mite infected crop persimilis
will keep reproducing in the crop as long
[SPEAKER_01]: as there's spider mites there within about
a week if there being no spider mites it
[SPEAKER_01]: just eats it cannibalizes itself and it's
gone so that's really a non-issue but when
[SPEAKER_01]: you get breeding sachets it can be an
issue because then it's giving a source of
[SPEAKER_01]: food so that sachet basically you hang
that in your crop it's releasing feeder
[SPEAKER_01]: mites and predator mites in your crop for
about four weeks so when with our program
[SPEAKER_01]: we always front load something so for
instance in cannabis or like swirski or
[SPEAKER_01]: californicus we would only ever put
sachets in like right when you're crops
[SPEAKER_01]: going into flowering that's kind of like
you do once the start of veg basically
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say you're vegging for three weeks
you're going to put sachets in then to
[SPEAKER_01]: cover your veg area you put them into
flower you put another round of sachets in
[SPEAKER_01]: because the first ones would have expired
and then that's going to kind of protect
[SPEAKER_01]: you up until your buds start to stack you
know for three or four weeks what you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't and i do see people do this
sometimes what you really don't want to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is be hanging them like in week four and
then you've got sachets that are releasing
[SPEAKER_01]: when right until week eight well 100 you
are going to get not just fecal matter
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination but actual mite
contamination is it a big issue not really
[SPEAKER_01]: i don't think most of the time you'll even
see it but i personally wouldn't do it to
[SPEAKER_01]: me like you really want to finish that you
know the last half of your crop with
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing in it like there should be no test
there should be no biocontrols in it so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like one of the things is people blow
it up the way people talk about it i'd say
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really not an issue yes the
predator mites poop absolutely it's one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things you just need to time the
applications properly and and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-issue yeah a great answer there i
guess as you mentioned in an ideal world
[SPEAKER_00]: the second half of the the fruiting the
flowering phase there's sort of ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions but in a sort of more realistic
world one of the questions which time and
[SPEAKER_00]: time again comes up is how do i fight off
an infestation that i've only just
[SPEAKER_00]: realized is that they're like week four
week five you know so you're on that
[SPEAKER_00]: second half you know it's a tough question
i understand but i guess i'm always
[SPEAKER_00]: interested how would you personally go
about tackling say a mite infestation that
[SPEAKER_00]: really only been picked up around week
four week five of flower yeah there's not
[SPEAKER_01]: a great answer for that because there it's
one of those things that there's can will
[SPEAKER_01]: bios do help you there yes can they turn
again if we're talking about spider-man
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically you're really that's getting
to the point where it's the point of no
[SPEAKER_01]: return so what happens with predator mites
is because they're you know they live on
[SPEAKER_01]: the underside of the leaf primarily
there's walking around the leaf like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how they hunt um and they'll walk
like if you put a predator mite on you
[SPEAKER_01]: know one leaf it'll walk up the whole
plant walk to the next plant if the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: are touching like they get around but like
the you know trichomes that's what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: there for is to protect the plant against
bugs right so predator mites they'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck in the trichomes like it's toxic to
them they get stuck physically get stuck
[SPEAKER_01]: to it um you know the terpenes probably in
some varieties are anti you know they're
[SPEAKER_01]: probably my decital um and also just the
buds just from physical like when you get
[SPEAKER_01]: you know a dense but a predator might
can't literally walk through it so let's
[SPEAKER_01]: say you have spider mites i see this is a
pretty common problem where somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't pay and that they don't pay
attention all of a sudden they're like
[SPEAKER_01]: holy cow i got spider mites and it's week
six or something like that and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to put stuff on well like you
basically have to put the persimmon on
[SPEAKER_01]: every leaf you want it because it can't
walk through the buds so there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: tricks that you can kind of like you can
do it but like so on a home garden it's
[SPEAKER_01]: doable on a commercial garden it's pretty
much impossible because you just like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's biocontrol you're relying on the
biocontrol to do the work for you of
[SPEAKER_01]: walking through the crop and finding the
pests and they just can't do it anymore um
[SPEAKER_01]: so there's stuff you can do but a lot of
that time you're really getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: physical controls like you're getting into
you know wiping the leaves with moist
[SPEAKER_01]: cloths or or you know in commercial really
your only option is you know you can spray
[SPEAKER_01]: them a bit with water to break them up and
the main option is physical removal just
[SPEAKER_01]: going through releasing the stuff and
hoping for the best there's really people
[SPEAKER_01]: want to hear there's a great solution the
great solution is pay attention to your
[SPEAKER_01]: crop earlier on because you didn't just
get spider mites in week four this doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: happen yeah 100 100 and i guess that's one
of the reasons why you know we sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: advocate you know spend time with your
plants you'll you'll pick up on these
[SPEAKER_00]: things i guess one of the options people
would maybe consider as you sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: referenced it that uh week four week five
infestation stages they might think oh
[SPEAKER_00]: i've got to spray with something uh what's
your what's your thoughts on neem oil i i
[SPEAKER_00]: think something which i've heard of a
little bit is there's maybe a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a misconception like people get
predators and then they spray neem oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm like oh i think you're killing the
predators there um doesn't really seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: be clear consensus in some people's minds
what's your thoughts on neem oil and would
[SPEAKER_00]: you ever use it in the presence of already
released predators um i think neem oil
[SPEAKER_01]: probably has a place i've definitely i've
used it long long ago we run into it a
[SPEAKER_01]: fair bit i generally steer away from it
and in canada in canada neem oil for
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons beyond me is really highly
regulated so it doesn't actually come up
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're not allowed to use it you're
not allowed to sell it so i have had a
[SPEAKER_01]: fair bit of experience with people using
it so i'd rather than focus on neem i
[SPEAKER_01]: would say generally any type of botanical
is a good idea to stay away from with
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrol so i let's say two things one
i've never seen anybody actually control
[SPEAKER_01]: pests properly with them people all swear
by it but they still all have spider mites
[SPEAKER_01]: or thrips and neem is definitely a
powerful tool i mean we both know that in
[SPEAKER_01]: certain situations um in specifically in
using it with biocontrol most and again
[SPEAKER_01]: most of our business is in conventional
agriculture so we've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with side effects like the side
effects of pesticides of all kinds on
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial insects every time not every
time but most a lot of our problems when
[SPEAKER_01]: you come into side effects on beneficials
come from botanicals that botanicals have
[SPEAKER_01]: just like they're having an effect on your
mice at some level they're also having an
[SPEAKER_01]: effect on your predators mites so i
generally steer clear of them completely
[SPEAKER_01]: um not just neem to rule it out i my
personal view is i'm big on like if i want
[SPEAKER_01]: to spray i mean like soaps work great if
you use them well soap is just like the
[SPEAKER_01]: second it's dry you can put predators in
there's no residual like they're good to
[SPEAKER_01]: go um same with some of the um the fungus
like the you know bulbaria and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that the entomopathogenic fungi those are
generally useful i personally like after
[SPEAKER_01]: like i said i've kind of grown up around
all of it i've grown up around the canada
[SPEAKER_01]: scene i've grown up around big commercial
greenhouses where they spray a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides and i've grown up around copper
where we use a lot of biocontrol i
[SPEAKER_01]: personally on cannabis would almost never
spray like that's one of the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: people i really in the majority of
situations i would never spray for a pest
[SPEAKER_01]: and i'm not just saying that because i
sell biocontrol i honestly think you get
[SPEAKER_01]: better control with biocontrol than you
will with sprays most of the time um it's
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the big myths i find in biocontrol
is people really underestimate how strong
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrol and they is and they
overestimate how strong some magic potion
[SPEAKER_00]: is yeah a brilliant answer i you sort of
touched on just the topic just in your
[SPEAKER_00]: answer you know sort of biocontrol myths
i'd be interested to hear are there any
[SPEAKER_00]: other sort of common biocontrol myths that
you find yourself dealing with um probably
[SPEAKER_01]: i mean that's a big one is just that
people really underestimate they really
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get how powerful it is like a lot of
people um like i said i would like to use
[SPEAKER_01]: my example when i came from koper came to
koper initially i had this i had the same
[SPEAKER_01]: perception where i thought it was kind of
like this you know it's good you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not affecting the environment it
probably don't work that well but you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it's environmentally sound blah
blah and the first literally my first day
[SPEAKER_01]: at work at koper they took me to this
greenhouse that was just the highest um
[SPEAKER_01]: pest pressure i've ever seen in my life
and they had literally switched to bio to
[SPEAKER_01]: almost entirely biocontrols because the
pesticides just didn't work so not the
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides didn't work they needed to use
them so frequently that the pest had just
[SPEAKER_01]: become resistant to them all so it was
like in a normal situation yeah that
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide works great if you use it once
or twice a year not if you're using it you
[SPEAKER_01]: know 50 times a year and so that was
really eye-opening to me that when you got
[SPEAKER_01]: into a situation like that and you're like
wow like they're not even this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest pest pressure i've ever seen in my
life they're not even using any pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: they're literally just battling it with
biocontrol and it's winning so that's one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the big things that i think people just
need to wrap their head around it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: a strong tool um one of the other ones
that comes up all the time is the climate
[SPEAKER_01]: so definitely people like there's
definitely differences with um different
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrols have different different
climate preferences but people really over
[SPEAKER_01]: complicate this so like first of all like
most crop plants grow in the same rough
[SPEAKER_01]: you know temperature and relative humidity
um situations um so like you never have so
[SPEAKER_01]: people are like oh i don't want to use
persimmon because i've got this special
[SPEAKER_01]: climate conditions i have like i said i've
worked here for 15 years i've basically
[SPEAKER_01]: never seen anyone with a special climate
condition um that you couldn't use
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrol with one caveat if you're
growing some crops nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis it's really cold then that's a
situation on cannabis it always works fine
[SPEAKER_01]: um do they work as well as they would in
an optimized climate like for instance one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the big things is relative humidity so
a lot of product are likely really like a
[SPEAKER_01]: higher relative humidity um so you know
and you know when we're finishing you know
[SPEAKER_01]: especially into constraints you're going
really way down like 40 45 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: relative humidity that's definitely not
ideal for a predator mite but one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the agricultural research stations
near where i live actually did a big uh
[SPEAKER_01]: like a peer review journal article years
ago on this and they actually measured the
[SPEAKER_01]: climate conditions on the phylo plane
which is the you know the immediate leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: surface you know the underside of the leaf
and what they found is that phylo plane
[SPEAKER_01]: which is that's specifically where the
predator might is living it's a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: buffer against the environment so even
though we're going down again i'm making
[SPEAKER_01]: these numbers up so hold me verbatim to
them but like let's say you're cranking
[SPEAKER_01]: your relative humidity down for late
flowering at like you know 40 or 45 that
[SPEAKER_01]: phylo plane um climate it's probably still
like 70 or something like that like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very hard to deviate to make that
microclimate change because they are um
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the stomata so the first of all
like the leaf is kind of shielded it from
[SPEAKER_01]: the light the stomata is one of the big
things is you know it's letting out water
[SPEAKER_01]: vapor underneath the leaf so in the you
know we're just talking about you know
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter of a millimeter or something like
that it's still humid there so they it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not as big of a deal as they think about
it it's honestly something that unless
[SPEAKER_01]: your temperature is under like 20 percent
or 20 degrees celsius all the time you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really need to worry about it um
they there are people be like he doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: always talk about there's um their eggs
dehydrated a low relative humidity that
[SPEAKER_01]: can sometimes be true for sure but you can
still use bio control yes maybe it just
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't reproduce as well um we like i
said bio control has been absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: standard in canada for cannabis production
since the start of legalization so i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know how many years that is quite a few um
it's what it's a well proven thing um less
[SPEAKER_01]: so in the u.s just because of a couple
other reasons just because they had more
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides and it was less regulated but
for sure in canada every person using
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis um or bio control on cannabis
since the start everyone has very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: clients it works fine yeah a brilliant
explanation there and given your
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in the canadian market a
question which a lot of the american
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners are often sort of interested in
is what do you think will be some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest pest issues facing the cannabis
market for example in the u.s as it
[SPEAKER_00]: continues to expand and get bigger and
more people get involved yeah well there's
[SPEAKER_01]: two things the biggest pest issue i think
it's probably always going to be thrips
[SPEAKER_01]: and spider mites but they're also ones
that there's good tools for they're fairly
[SPEAKER_01]: easy to control um might be a little bit
different when you get into down in the
[SPEAKER_01]: more southern parts of the u.s so one of
the things you get is like for instance if
[SPEAKER_01]: we look at thrips that's for sure like one
of the big issues um but we've got a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of good tools like all the bio controls
work really well on trips but 99 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: of all the trips we deal with in canada
and northern u.s is western flower trips
[SPEAKER_01]: or onion trips and we know bio control
works really well on that but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands different types of trips so when
you get down into like you know southern
[SPEAKER_01]: florida probably southern california any
of those southern areas there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of trips the bio control
doesn't work for so if that could emerge
[SPEAKER_01]: as an issue where there's just not any
great tools like not the traditional tools
[SPEAKER_01]: don't work that's to be seen right now i
would say the bigger issue is most likely
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids um because and maybe hemp russet
maybe russet might for two reasons or for
[SPEAKER_01]: one the same reason that there's not a lot
of great solutions for it so aphid control
[SPEAKER_01]: is really challenging there are some great
solutions for it but the thing with aphids
[SPEAKER_01]: is they live birth so when when you get
one aphid in your garden um they're
[SPEAKER_01]: already like they don't need to sexually
reproduce so they've already got all their
[SPEAKER_01]: babies inside them ready to go and i
believe some entomologists probably
[SPEAKER_01]: correct me i'm pretty sure those babies
are literally like the second they come
[SPEAKER_01]: out they've already got babies ready to go
so they reproduce at a scary rate like
[SPEAKER_01]: i've seen multiple times where someone's
literally got like one cannabis aphid in
[SPEAKER_01]: their garden and you come back three weeks
later and like the whole garden is ready
[SPEAKER_01]: to come down so we have predators that
work really really well on them it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard to get rid of um all of the
aphids though so like the thing when
[SPEAKER_01]: something's like that you literally have
to get when it reproduces that fast you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to get rid of every single aphid to
control the problem and that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really happen very often either with
spraying or um biocontrol it does happen
[SPEAKER_01]: if you got like a real you know heavy
synthetic systemic spray you can get rid
[SPEAKER_01]: of one treatment but i don't think that's
likely to be an option so i think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a real challenge just because
biocontrol for aphids as all we kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: know what all the tools are when it comes
to biocontrols and we know they it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging to get rid of aphids 100 it's
pretty easy to control them 80 but you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't necessarily especially with cannabis
even it is really for anyone that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have them don't get them they are absolute
nightmares um it's basically it's
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially impossible to get rid of them
once you get them so just don't get them
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone brings them in on clones like
it's very preventable the preventable pest
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not a particularly controllable
pest and then russet mite or whatever any
[SPEAKER_01]: of those tar sonovan mites they haven't
really emerged too much as a pest so far
[SPEAKER_01]: in canada i know that it was more of an
issue down in california and colorado but
[SPEAKER_01]: it does have the potential just because um
they kind of have a niche where predator
[SPEAKER_01]: mites generally are pretty good at
controlling stuff like russet mite but
[SPEAKER_01]: again they're hard to control them 100 so
a russet mite or a broad mite they're
[SPEAKER_01]: really tiny so they're a lot smaller than
a predator mite so that's kind of their
[SPEAKER_01]: evolutionary niche is they can get into
spots where the where their predators
[SPEAKER_01]: can't get so for instance if you got a
plant in flowering it can go way deep into
[SPEAKER_01]: a trichome stand where a swirski even
though it can eat it or a californicas can
[SPEAKER_01]: eat it it can't get in that in that uh
stand and you get the same thing you can
[SPEAKER_01]: go like in growing tips and stuff so
generally what we've seen again i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: looking not just at cannabis but other
crops usually when people use biocontrol
[SPEAKER_01]: as a main standard those pests like russet
mite or broad mite aren't much of an issue
[SPEAKER_01]: because preventatively they do a really
good job of stopping them from ever
[SPEAKER_01]: getting established and it's kind of why i
think maybe you saw that emergence in the
[SPEAKER_01]: early days out of california and um
colorado nobody was really using predators
[SPEAKER_01]: that much back then so and you don't hear
about it as much and we've definitely had
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of outbreaks in canada at lps but
it's been very very low but it could be
[SPEAKER_01]: like the potential and they're ones that's
very easily spread through cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: material and that's the one thing i've
seen in the legalized industries is really
[SPEAKER_01]: of just an unprecedented amount of
spreading of clones between facilities and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's something that could easily get
going but if i had to pick one it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: 100 cannabis aphid second would probably
be root aphid yeah i mean there's
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly two pests i've seen cause havoc
in a variety of different grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environments something i was hoping to get
your opinion on is i had noticed i'd been
[SPEAKER_00]: to a few bigger facilities when i'd been
over in the states and it sort of seemed
[SPEAKER_00]: to me like when a facility got to a
certain size it just sort of reached this
[SPEAKER_00]: critical mass and pest infestation was
almost inevitable from what i had seen and
[SPEAKER_00]: admittedly limited number of sites i'd
been to you've probably been to many more
[SPEAKER_00]: larger facilities than i have would you
agree that you've seen that sort of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: happen regularly or is my experience as
maybe a little skewed and that's not what
[SPEAKER_01]: normally happens no it's definitely true
we've also seen it on other crops there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a general rule as the facility gets bigger
the pest issues get bigger also um i think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's for a bunch of reasons i think more
of it though is like i've definitely seen
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of thing is evolving you get um
even you'll get guys that when they've got
[SPEAKER_01]: small scenes you kind of on top of like
for instance thrips is one of things like
[SPEAKER_01]: i've seen and same with spider mites i've
seen guys that have literally they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: growing for like 10 years on you know they
maybe got a 40 lighter they've never had
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips and all of a sudden they get them
and they can never get rid of them are the
[SPEAKER_01]: trips under control they're like yes like
they're using biocontrol it controls them
[SPEAKER_01]: but i think it's like one of those things
like once you get thrips in your crop
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like that's just one of the big
things that i think people don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand properly when it comes to pests
is the difference between like a thrips or
[SPEAKER_01]: any pest and a thrips that's adapted to
the crop that you're in so when you get a
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips that you know let's say you get a
thrips infestation by default you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got a gazillion thrips in there
some of them really like cannabis right
[SPEAKER_01]: and those tend to be the ones that
reproduce so then you get them really um
[SPEAKER_01]: adapted to your environment and they're
really hard to get rid of because like
[SPEAKER_01]: again all you need is you know one or two
thrips i guess two thrips and so you know
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you don't have them for it looks
like you don't have thrips for two months
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they come back well it's just
because you didn't it's almost impossible
[SPEAKER_01]: to get rid of every single thrips out of
your facility so i think when those guys
[SPEAKER_01]: were smaller it wasn't they could go a
long time without ever getting thrips but
[SPEAKER_01]: now they're bigger eventually it comes in
from somewhere once you get them you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got them for good like thrips just if you
look at any other crop which is just like
[SPEAKER_01]: a standard like anyone thinks they're
never going to have thrips is dreaming
[SPEAKER_01]: like they're just they're everywhere right
they're outside in the grass they're
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in on your workers they're coming
in on eggs in your plant material like
[SPEAKER_01]: there's too many avenues for them to come
in so um yeah i think that would be my
[SPEAKER_00]: answer for that one yeah okay i mean
you've got me sort of thinking now what
[SPEAKER_00]: might be some of the sort of specific
challenges the cannabis plant presents in
[SPEAKER_00]: a biocontrol program or like for example
even just the environment you know are
[SPEAKER_00]: there any sort of room conditions which
might make biocontrol more challenging or
[SPEAKER_01]: more easy in fact yeah the biggest i mean
the biggest room condition it generally
[SPEAKER_01]: hasn't been much of an issue the one thing
i've had now that people have kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: dialed in their systems i don't see it as
much but back when those first facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: started getting built you know large scale
i saw a bunch of times where people had
[SPEAKER_01]: their horizontal airflow fans just mounted
too low and there seemed to be a pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: all right some guys that really like to
you've probably seen like you go into
[SPEAKER_01]: their crop and you're like man it's like a
tropical storm in here you know the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are bending over they've just got so much
fans going on them and that's the only
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that i've really seen in cannabis
production that's caused a big issue so
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance we had a facility that had a
big they had a thrips problem but the
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips problem was only around the
perimeter of the room and what it was was
[SPEAKER_01]: in the perimeter of the room those fans
were creating like a microclimate they
[SPEAKER_01]: were just basically drying out the leaf so
much that the predator mites just couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: live on there so the predator mites were
working fine in the middle of the room but
[SPEAKER_01]: when it got close to the fans they the
thrips were taking over because the thrips
[SPEAKER_01]: were able to uh you know tolerate that
high wind so that's really been the main
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that i think we've seen and it's not
that common it's kind of now that people
[SPEAKER_01]: really plants don't really like to be
grown in a tropical storm condition people
[SPEAKER_01]: have moved away from that the plant itself
definitely presents some challenges and
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the biggest so there's two the two
main challenges is one that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: predator mites don't reproduce on it the
way they reproduce on other crops so like
[SPEAKER_01]: i said before i kind of got into this
before where they they really need that
[SPEAKER_01]: specialized plant here to lay their eggs
on and i think you get some like i
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely seen some reproduction but if i
compare it to like a pepper crop or a
[SPEAKER_01]: cucumber crop it's nothing compared to
those crops like they really those are
[SPEAKER_01]: ones you could literally put in a little
bit of loose stuff in one corner and you
[SPEAKER_01]: come back you know two months later and
there's predator mites like over your
[SPEAKER_01]: whole crop with cannabis you really need
to put the constant supply in there to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the numbers up high enough so that's
one thing that people try and extrapolate
[SPEAKER_01]: what's gone on in other crops and you
can't really do it from peppers to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is different crops you really
want to make sure you've got again not
[SPEAKER_01]: during during peak flower but you want to
have a continuous source of predator mites
[SPEAKER_01]: which usually means sachets and then the
other thing that people you really need to
[SPEAKER_01]: front load it so like for instance like a
pepper crop or a lot of other crops you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got like a long window to control your
pest in like a pepper crop that's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: year in a greenhouse with cannabis i mean
i don't know what the average fit to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at i mean probably the average guy's
vegging for like two weeks and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they've got another two or three weeks in
flowering before the buds are too stacked
[SPEAKER_01]: up to control them properly so you've got
at best a four or five week window to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with so you can't use conventional rates
so for instance on a vegetable crop you
[SPEAKER_01]: might put 10 per meter per stimulus in
because it's got you know months to
[SPEAKER_01]: control of spider mites in cannabis you
maybe got four or five weeks so i mean
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of 10 you're putting in like 100
or something like that so that's something
[SPEAKER_01]: you really need to compensate you really
need to go hot like front load everything
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to be treating your it really
starts at your mom's you want to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you really wanted to start from the from
the start of the whole thing and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're ramping off as you get into
flowering not what a lot of people do is
[SPEAKER_01]: go holy cow i got a big problem and then
they start ramping up as you go into bio
[SPEAKER_01]: as into flowering you really want a strong
preventative approach and to be on those
[SPEAKER_01]: things before your bud stack up once
you're in like you know depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: strain you know once first i find most
strains it's like the first third of
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering is the stretch period like the
veg period so you really want to have all
[SPEAKER_01]: your pests controlled done within that
first one third yeah a brilliant sentiment
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully people can start implementing
that one so they don't find themselves in
[SPEAKER_00]: the uh the dreaded week four week five
surprise of finding the the russet mites
[SPEAKER_00]: are actually everywhere sort of got me
thinking about the future of ipm
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies and pest management and
[SPEAKER_00]: something i was hoping you might have
breeding for pest resistance might become
[SPEAKER_00]: a more focal part of pest management in
general in the future yeah it's 100 true
[SPEAKER_01]: like there's no doubt about that we've
seen it so many times um with i've seen it
[SPEAKER_01]: in lps i've seen it like it's a standing
joke in the canadian cannabis community
[SPEAKER_01]: there was this clone going around called
uh people call it the perps or vancouver
[SPEAKER_01]: island uh purple indica and it is the
every person i'm known that's had this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing it is the most pest prone thing
you've ever got like if you've got an
[SPEAKER_01]: aphid in the garden it's on this clone it
just and partly i think it's really old
[SPEAKER_01]: clones so when plants get older they
become more attractive to pests but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely like this clone is a pest
magnet we actually do at koper we are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually doing research on on uh on
cannabis aphid control we specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: actually used that clone because we knew
the canvas aphid just loved it and i've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen it a lot i don't think anyone can
like think we're definitely we've seen for
[SPEAKER_01]: instance sativa like really sativa ones um
they tend to get um thrips really early
[SPEAKER_01]: but again it comes down to the terpene
thing i think there's it so it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: variable i've definitely seen a lot of
hazes really get thrips um bad um i think
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene is one of the bigger issues and
where i think people overthink it so is
[SPEAKER_01]: this can breeding be done probably i think
personally i think it's more of a disease
[SPEAKER_01]: thing than pest thing i think stuff like
that purple indica clone will just
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally get culled out of the population
because you back want to deal with with
[SPEAKER_01]: that um i think disease resistance is very
much in uh something that needs to be done
[SPEAKER_01]: and will be done in breeding specifically
for powdery mildew and hepatitis um pest
[SPEAKER_01]: one i'm not i'm not sure i do i've
definitely seen some people steer
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves wrong where they're like no no
i'm not going to grow any haze because i
[SPEAKER_01]: know i heard that haze gets whatever
thrips or something else and i mean you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you know yourself like it's not so
it's not like any of the strains they're
[SPEAKER_01]: so um stable like every different
phenotype is slightly different so i think
[SPEAKER_01]: you got people that are like i'm not
growing og kush because it's this and i
[SPEAKER_01]: was like well one og if you grow a pack
you're probably gonna get one that really
[SPEAKER_01]: gets thrips and another one that perhaps
won't even go close to it so it's not so
[SPEAKER_01]: black and white and i've definitely seen
some lps getting into that where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like i'm not growing that because it's
this strain and they're like dude like all
[SPEAKER_01]: hazes aren't the same um you can't make
those blanket statements but definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: from clone to clone that is not a urban
legend that is for sure real that some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff is far more susceptible to different
tests than others yeah okay that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to hear and good to know it's
uh it's not all in my head another
[SPEAKER_00]: question i was interested in is that i've
noticed there can be sort of a variability
[SPEAKER_00]: in activity levels of some of the mites
i've gotten are there any recommendations
[SPEAKER_00]: you have that can help ensure once i do
have the predator and i'm releasing it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden that i'm sort of getting the
most out of them you know are there any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of factors which i may unawareingly
hindering them or you know accidentally
[SPEAKER_01]: killing them off after releasing them um
not too much usually if there's an issue
[SPEAKER_01]: with like the only two real issues is like
spraying is one um access airflow is
[SPEAKER_01]: another of just like like direct on the
plant but the one thing i would i'd caveat
[SPEAKER_01]: that statement with is that they
definitely like predator mites like
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot to them so you there's
definitely suppliers on the market that
[SPEAKER_01]: probably sell some pretty crappy predator
mice um but what i would caveat is i would
[SPEAKER_01]: say um like i run you know part of my job
is i kind of oversee a lot of the the
[SPEAKER_01]: sales complaints and stuff that come in
and i would say the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: complaints that we get um especially for
predator mites they're just perceived
[SPEAKER_01]: complaints they're not there's not
actually anything wrong with the product
[SPEAKER_01]: so like they're hard to see like
especially if you don't know what your
[SPEAKER_01]: look like if you're not really trained for
what you're looking for and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people they're looking at it with a bare
eye well i've been doing this for like
[SPEAKER_01]: half my life and i can't tell you without
a microscope so there's a couple things to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep in mind so one predator mites because
they're so tiny like they're really hard
[SPEAKER_01]: to count so what you can definitely get is
a real thing like let's say you buy a
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle of persimilus let's say it's
supposed to be 10 000 in it most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: time there's more like 15 or 17 000 in
there because they overpack everything and
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm sure we're not the only company that
does that because you need to guarantee
[SPEAKER_01]: there's 10 000 you can't have somebody
sitting there it's very difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: calculate exactly how much is in there so
people overshoot it so let's say we're and
[SPEAKER_01]: don't hold many numbers but it's
definitely like this like it's okay you're
[SPEAKER_01]: way over the spec and then maybe there's a
like first of all those populations
[SPEAKER_01]: fluctuate a little bit so the same amount
of material one week might have whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 000 mites the next week might have 17
000 mites so it fluctuates and you get
[SPEAKER_01]: people but people don't get so we're
guaranteeing a minimum and quite often
[SPEAKER_01]: they're getting way more than that and
then what happens is yeah there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks that you're actually getting what we
say you're getting and but you get used to
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing something and it's it's not active
you know what i mean you're getting used
[SPEAKER_01]: to seeing way more than you're actually
paying for that's definitely a big a big
[SPEAKER_01]: issue and the thing also is people don't
get like there's a there's not like
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some bios that are difficult to
ship predator mites are one of the easiest
[SPEAKER_01]: things to ship because they've got it
because you're not shipping them dormant
[SPEAKER_01]: like there's a food source in there so
they're just alive and at room temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the time so there's not really a
whole lot to go wrong in transport so does
[SPEAKER_01]: it happen sure sometimes absolutely but
it's a very small percentage of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: that that's great that answers what i was
wondering almost perfectly so up next we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually had a question submitted from one
of our patreon listeners and they
[SPEAKER_00]: basically said look you know i love the
i'm just going to read it word for word
[SPEAKER_00]: because i love the way they've worded it
they say thrips are the devil they
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally occur outdoors in my area and
it's impossible to grow a plant without
[SPEAKER_00]: getting them i've knocked them down before
but they always come back if the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: stays healthy and they don't take them
over it's just a constant fight without
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides beneficials help but they don't
seem to ever reproduce enough to keep up
[SPEAKER_01]: have you got any suggestions yeah so i
think and you do get some air like the out
[SPEAKER_01]: the outdoor kind of ambient level of
thrips can vary a lot between different
[SPEAKER_01]: places like i always remember i had a
greenhouse um like i said i grew where i
[SPEAKER_01]: live is like there's literally 3 000 acres
of greenhouses in 20 minutes i mean so
[SPEAKER_01]: i've seen like a lot of pest pressure and
like i've seen a lot of crops and but i
[SPEAKER_01]: also do all over can i work all over
canada and i remember being out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: prairies once and which is a drier grassy
kind of habitat and we could never control
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips at this one facility and i remember
trying to put my finger on like what was
[SPEAKER_01]: going on and i was like you know what i'm
just going to hang some sticky cards
[SPEAKER_01]: outside to see like what the outside
pressure was and this was like a 10 acre
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses thing and i hung a yellow
sticky card outside one end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and then i drove to the end
which maybe took you know two minutes or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that and hung another one
and just on a fluke on the way back i was
[SPEAKER_01]: like i'll just check that first card and
see if it caught anything yet and that
[SPEAKER_01]: first card had like you know 10 000 trips
on or something where where i live it
[SPEAKER_01]: would have like one if that um so it
really can be different so you definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: can get some areas where you're just
getting a crazy amount of strips coming
[SPEAKER_01]: inside so i don't know whether he's
outdoors or in a greenhouse or indoors
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors there's definitely a lot of offer
between you so i'd say if you're getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: big problem in a small indoor place you're
probably making the problem yourself even
[SPEAKER_01]: though you don't want to admit it so
basically where i think most people go
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong it inserts control is they are not
most people but when there's a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: it's generally to do with this issue is
predator mites they're only they are your
[SPEAKER_01]: best your kind of baseline attack but
predator mites doesn't matter what kind
[SPEAKER_01]: they're only used they're only eating the
first end star of thrips so that's thrips
[SPEAKER_01]: will lay its egg on the plant and then
that egg hatches out into the first larval
[SPEAKER_01]: stage which is kind of like a little worm
that that has no wings it can just crawl
[SPEAKER_01]: down and feeds so thrips or swirski or
kookamaris they only eat that one stage so
[SPEAKER_01]: once it gets past that stage if you're
just using predator mites there's all
[SPEAKER_01]: these strips in your crop that you're not
controlling at all and then an adult
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips in some in some temperatures it'll
last like a month two months even longer
[SPEAKER_01]: so that can be like your whole crop where
you've got this big thrips problem and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're putting in swirski thinking you did
something but you've got all these adult
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips flying around you know causing
chaos that nothing is controlling so you
[SPEAKER_01]: really have to go a multi same with any
pets you need to go with a multi-pronged
[SPEAKER_01]: approach so for there you're going to put
your predator mites as your kind of base
[SPEAKER_01]: level control but then you need to put
something else in to get those other
[SPEAKER_01]: stages out of the equation and the best
especially on cannabis because it really
[SPEAKER_01]: likes the cannabis plant is probably our
trade name is thripor but it's aureus and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like a predatory bug so it can fly
around and they're like thrips killers
[SPEAKER_01]: like they're generous but they really like
killing thrips and you put like they will
[SPEAKER_01]: literally turn get rid of all the thrips
in like a week usually the problem with
[SPEAKER_01]: like and they go after all the different
stages the problem is if you were to not
[SPEAKER_01]: put the predator mite and just put in the
thripor or the aureus is they'll eat all
[SPEAKER_01]: your thrips and then they die off because
there's no food and then there's a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of thrips eggs in the leaf which two
weeks later hatch out and then there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: predator for them and bang you got a
thrips problem again so that's why you
[SPEAKER_01]: always want that overlapping you know the
predator mites are controlling any new
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff coming up and then the thripor is
killing any of the larger stages another
[SPEAKER_01]: one it doesn't work quite as well but it's
a it's a viable strategy is to use a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of sticky cards so sticky cards will
attach the adult thrips that are attracted
[SPEAKER_01]: to it so you can also use that combination
where you're using a predator mites to go
[SPEAKER_01]: after those young stages the sticky cards
to go after the to catch the adults so i
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the time when i see people have
issues with thrips it's because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: ignoring those other life cycle stages i
guess it's sort of segues into the future
[SPEAKER_00]: of products you know a lot of uh recent
and interesting new technologies are
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging in the predator and ipm industry
and one that we've been talking about a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit at the start of our episodes is
um some of the new technology you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: have been working on particularly the one
that caught my eye was the spydex vital
[SPEAKER_00]: that proof of predation technology was
really interesting from my perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: because it gives you that real time
feedback on the activity levels of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mites with that um you know changing color
sort of technology do you think that
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll become a new industry standard
having these sort of built-in features
[SPEAKER_00]: around predators and do you have any other
cool things on the horizon you might be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to let us know about um so i don't
know that so that's an interesting one
[SPEAKER_01]: because the the so what happens is when
you buy the predator mite it's translucent
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can see through it so and then when
it eats spider mites it turns bright red
[SPEAKER_01]: so that was kind of a side effect of
something else so that spider mites was
[SPEAKER_01]: that one like it was the last remaining
predator mite that nobody could figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: how to rear on something other than its
natural prey source so it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: consequence of eating spider mites that
makes it red so in the old up until this
[SPEAKER_01]: year we used to rear them on spider mites
so they'd be red when you bought them um
[SPEAKER_01]: now we figured out how to rear them on a
different food source um so they're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually not red and it's a really cool
thing because you put them into the crop
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're clear and they instantly so
there's no doubt about whether they're
[SPEAKER_01]: working you're like well are they red okay
well then it's eating spider mites like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's that clear because that's the only
thing that can make them red but it wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: there as an indicator just something that
was kind of a cool thing that um that you
[SPEAKER_01]: know was an added benefit so that was kind
of the last one for like all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: predator mites were always like that so i
don't know whether that will be uh where
[SPEAKER_01]: the future i actually don't know where the
future a lot of it will probably be some
[SPEAKER_01]: new predator mites is really the forefront
of the of biocontrol it's you know not for
[SPEAKER_01]: some pests like aphids and white fly or
white fly a little bit but um just because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're really they're cost effective
because they're quite inexpensive to rear
[SPEAKER_01]: and um versus like if you're using some of
the other you know macro type of bios like
[SPEAKER_01]: a parasitic wasp and stuff generally
they've got to be reared on a pest and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's cost-prohibitive because you've got
to have a greenhouse with a crop in it
[SPEAKER_01]: then you got a pest so i'm going to guess
that probably more along those lines of
[SPEAKER_01]: rearing stuff on fictitious hosts um is
going to be the future and possibly some
[SPEAKER_01]: new you know new biologicals that um you
know maybe there's a new a different
[SPEAKER_01]: parasitic wasp it doesn't exist isn't
commercialized right now that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: good on you know better on cannabis aphid
or a different predator might that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really good on hemp russet might there's
probably stuff like that in the future but
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah i just sell them they tell me that
when it's when it's ready to sell i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: i don't get too much of the privy on the
on the behind the scenes the rmd and sorry
[SPEAKER_01]: what was the other part of your question
for that one i i guess the other question
[SPEAKER_00]: was do you think these sort of features
like for example the proof of predation
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that will sort of start to
become integrated as sort of mainstays in
[SPEAKER_00]: predators to or do you think that's just a
one-off sort of situation yeah i think
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just a one-off i mean that proof of
predation is there it's just less
[SPEAKER_01]: noticeable i think it's more that people
are gonna like we're really at an infant
[SPEAKER_01]: level especially in the cannabis industry
in understanding biocontrol um like
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis people think they're so
innovative but honestly like most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other crops are years ahead of them when
it comes to understanding biocontrol
[SPEAKER_01]: they've just been using it for a long time
so for instance that same proof of
[SPEAKER_01]: predation i mean you can see with swirski
might that it changes color depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: which pest um it has like i can look in a
crop and look at the color of your swirski
[SPEAKER_01]: and tell you whether you get a pest
problem or not because of the shade of
[SPEAKER_01]: amber it is but you know there's lots of
stuff like that um so i think that just
[SPEAKER_01]: the general understanding has a lot of
room to to come up i think most people are
[SPEAKER_01]: not at it's really it's changed rapidly in
cannabis you know in those years because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the first time where i said a lot
of the industry i'd say is a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe ahead is the wrong word but the
cannabis industry has definitely evolved
[SPEAKER_01]: way faster because it's the only industry
where they literally got like some dude
[SPEAKER_01]: with a phd in biocontrol that's running
their biocontrol thing but it's just it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a newer crop right so wasn't that common
before legalization to use biocontrol yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: okay yeah that's that makes sense for sure
it's it's definitely a new crop where not
[SPEAKER_00]: everything is the same as prior one of the
sort of final questions i wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: you that was of personal interest to me
because i am unapologetically biased
[SPEAKER_00]: towards organic growth styles do you think
that organic growth styles sort of have a
[SPEAKER_00]: innate better chance to fight off pests
than cocoa or do you think it's relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: an even battlefield oh man you're trying
to make an internet uh give me some
[SPEAKER_00]: internet haters views expressed are mine
alone and not yours so this is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a whole lot of hate but i would say
unanimously and copper is like a big
[SPEAKER_01]: company so like we're all over the world
and there's like literally some of the top
[SPEAKER_01]: best control people in the world work for
us i would say pretty much unanimously
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone that i work with in copper and in
commercial green handlers thinks that's
[SPEAKER_01]: largely a bunch of hokey i have not seen
that i think it's probably like most
[SPEAKER_01]: things there's a bit of both things i've
honestly seen the most pest infested crops
[SPEAKER_01]: as a general rule are the organic ones not
the conventional ones and i'm an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: guy i really believe in organic
agriculture i'm just telling you the truth
[SPEAKER_01]: and i think what agriculture people miss
about organic stuff is like one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: missing links is like the nutrition levels
like so you get a plant it's very hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: dial in the nutrition especially in the
greenhouse or indoors where it's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: really intensive you know lighting regime
and stuff like that to get a properly
[SPEAKER_01]: dialed in um plant for nutrients in my
opinion is way easier with synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: that's with synthetic fertilizer and
you'll see even if you've ever read steve
[SPEAKER_01]: solomon's book he's one of the you know
gurus of organic it's one of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that he discovers once you start looking
into like the nutritional value of organic
[SPEAKER_01]: food yeah it doesn't have pesticide
residues and it's probably got a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: attributes for like you know maybe it's
got higher antioxidants and stuff but when
[SPEAKER_01]: you start looking at like okay well how
much calcium does it have in it or how
[SPEAKER_01]: much phosphorus does it have in it a lot
of times the organic stuff is really low
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to synthetic not that it's not
possible but that's just the reality so i
[SPEAKER_01]: think that's part of the kind of like i
said i think a healthy plant is more
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant to diseases but i think or pests
and diseases but i also think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely over inflated and not going to
be an expert or you know the word but like
[SPEAKER_01]: i've seen i there might be something to it
but when you see like i've just seen
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands and thousands and thousands of
acres of crops and a lot of times pests
[SPEAKER_01]: show up willy-nilly they're not
necessarily going for the weakest plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that does happen sometimes but a lot of
times it's just like they just show up
[SPEAKER_01]: randomly so let's say it's not as true as
everybody thinks and i think a lot of it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes down it's not to do with whether
it's or organic or conventional it's to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with what the nutrition level is in the
plant that actually makes sense i want i
[SPEAKER_01]: want to believe man i literally have come
from that like i i literally was in
[SPEAKER_01]: amsterdam in like 95 when uh positronics
used to do like they were like the
[SPEAKER_01]: original proprietors of no-till i was
there like i learned from those guys and i
[SPEAKER_01]: actually i'm a i'm a no-till non-believer
i'll just i'll just say it not a
[SPEAKER_01]: non-believer but i've been there and i've
left and i will never go back i just i
[SPEAKER_01]: think there's a lot of like i'm not
convinced that that's the best plan on
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple levels and i know that's a
heavily a highly unpopular opinion but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's my no that's good and you know what
it also it makes me start thinking that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know there's sort of a lot of
variables in the equation because as you
[SPEAKER_00]: said it actually totally makes sense to me
that the worst gardens you see with
[SPEAKER_00]: infestations are organic because if
they're utilizing the things we've touched
[SPEAKER_00]: on earlier like neem and things like that
in an attempt to stay organic but uh you
[SPEAKER_00]: know maybe somewhat ineffective whereas
maybe you know the soilless guys are a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more ready to use some of the more
bang for your buck type principles be it
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides things like that but that's
interesting to know and it's good to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's sort of for a long time i've
been wondering why the biggest producers
[SPEAKER_00]: are all soilless so that's probably a
pretty good reason why right like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just it plays into it i think well i think
there's a bunch of reasons i personally
[SPEAKER_01]: like where if my general belief in just
agriculture which i guess i've been in it
[SPEAKER_01]: for like probably around 30 years or or
more and it's kind of evolved over time
[SPEAKER_01]: i've been a pure organic guy in some cases
and pure synthetic and honestly when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to whether it's plant nutrition um
human nutrition or pest control pest and
[SPEAKER_01]: disease control i'm really a really and i
think and copart also is we're really firm
[SPEAKER_01]: believers in integration where i don't
think that pure organic is the solution
[SPEAKER_01]: and i don't think that pure conventional
is there synthetic is the solution i think
[SPEAKER_01]: the real answer is a combination of the
two i think there's some really good
[SPEAKER_01]: things that organics brings to the table
and i think there's some really good
[SPEAKER_01]: things that just putting chemical salts
can bring to the table in in some
[SPEAKER_01]: situations and it's really the same with
biocontrol like a lot of people think that
[SPEAKER_01]: copart's like we're oh the copart guy or
the biocontrol guy he's always going to
[SPEAKER_01]: push bios we don't really believe in pure
biocontrol there's basically nobody in our
[SPEAKER_01]: company that believes in that we really
believe in integrated like there's a ton
[SPEAKER_01]: there's certain pests there is just
probably never going to be a great
[SPEAKER_01]: biocontrol solution you're going to need
to whatever use a physical means or or a
[SPEAKER_01]: spray or something like that and i think
that's that's kind of my view on
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture it's really everything's
integrated and whenever somebody gets too
[SPEAKER_01]: far into their that's their belief system
integrate their ideas too much it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily the best thing and i'd
also say part of the reason why some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those organic places that i've seen like
i've seen some really filthy organic
[SPEAKER_01]: places i've seen the filthy synthetic
places too but i'd say part of the factor
[SPEAKER_01]: in those organic things is the magic
factor is they want to believe that
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's magically taking care of
itself and they just don't even look and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you go like i always remember i won't
mention any names or there was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: guys in canada was literally one of the
most famous organic people here he was one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the pioneers and i was friends with him
from both before i was in koper and he
[SPEAKER_01]: said he invited us head to the greenheads
just because we're friends and he's like
[SPEAKER_01]: i'll go take a look he says i'll tell you
up front there's nothing to see there
[SPEAKER_01]: because you know the magic factor you know
we've been organic for so long and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything self-regulates and it's all in
balance and it was the filthiest crop i've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever seen and this was a place that
literally that was the highest the most
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive produce in the time in canada
and it was absolutely filthy and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: because of he he believed that it was
clean and chefs probably believed it was
[SPEAKER_01]: clean because he kept telling him how
magic everything was so i'm kind of a i
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know become more of a practical
practicalist that's the word for over over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years yeah no i i'm on board i'm on
board our inherent biases make fools of us
[SPEAKER_00]: all right that's really interesting to
hear that that's how it sort of played out
[SPEAKER_00]: for you i will have to keep that in mind
but um with that being said i think that
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much brings us to the end of what i
was hoping to chat about did you have any
[SPEAKER_01]: comments or shout outs you wanted to make
um no no no real comments a shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: all the people like bringing us new bio
controls and new technologies because i
[SPEAKER_01]: think those are the people that they get
underrated a lot of everyone doesn't i
[SPEAKER_01]: don't think most people realize how much
work goes into bringing new products um to
[SPEAKER_01]: market those are kind of the
underpreciated people so i'd shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: all the rnd people that are locked away in
a in a lab somewhere coming up with
[SPEAKER_00]: solutions yeah a huge shout out to those
guys and you know likewise a shout out to
