[SPEAKER_02]: history, of course, some Big Sur legend,
and so much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without further delay, let's get into
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty gang, a massive welcome for
joining us for yet another episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on today, we are extremely grateful to
have one of the biggest heads in the
[SPEAKER_03]: community, a Californian native,
preserver of the Big Sur holy weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: co-founder of the bio agronomics group
with Rob Clark, and a connoisseur all
[SPEAKER_03]: round.
[SPEAKER_03]: A big, big welcome to Mojave Richmond for
joining us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, look, I am so grateful for you joining
us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as usual, I want to start off by
asking, what have you been smoking on
[SPEAKER_03]: lately?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, actually I've been trialing out some,
or I've been testing out some trial
[SPEAKER_00]: selections from a project last year with a
group Hayes Valley up in Watsonville.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some crosses there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sage times, it's actually Zeta times Kim
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's Sage, OG, Kim and Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the F2s, some of the
selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've been puffing on lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing that I've been really
enjoying is this Cambodian that came from
[SPEAKER_00]: Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gifted me some seeds a few years back
and it's just super, super nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: like really friendly all day approachable,
just lovely weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm so, so jealous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess like the first thing that jumps to
mind when I hear that is what sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: qualities does a Cambodian bring?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I mean, I sadly haven't had a lot
of exposure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I think about it, the only real
callback to Cambodian I can think of is
[SPEAKER_03]: you often heard about the original Kalimis
seeds as like having some amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: Cambodian in the maybe, maybe it was like
sort of just whispers, but maybe it was
[SPEAKER_03]: true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd love to hear from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's smoking a Cambodian like and what
sort of traits and qualities does it bring
[SPEAKER_03]: to the table in your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can't say about the Kalimis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard that before, but
definitely I think Kalimis is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most exotic and really just amazing
cultivars with one thing also a really
[SPEAKER_00]: approachable, just elegant high.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Cambodian is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim, Mel Frank, Jim Goodwin, Mel Frank
gave me these seeds a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, no, first he gave me some
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, narrow leaf,
very equatorial looking kind of similar
[SPEAKER_00]: minty slash spicy kind of aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one, it had a really nice high,
really nice effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, Mel had shared that,
you know, like, yeah, we really like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he got it analyzed and it came
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a one to one THC CBD, which was
really eye opening for me because all the
[SPEAKER_00]: I typically don't like most CBD varieties
for one, just, you know, my, I guess my
[SPEAKER_00]: curiosity around CBD and whether how
effective it is and whether it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, modulating or, you know,
moderate, you know, how it's impacting the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall high, I think is basically,
you know, always been my question in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, how it impacts THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the interesting part here was that
this was the first time I had a one to one
[SPEAKER_00]: variety that was completely non Afghan
derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't ACDC, Charlotte's Web,
Kanatonic from that whole pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the overall profile was very narrow
leaf, but it also had CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of made me think about what
these wonder ones were really like and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much of the thing that I didn't like about
all the wonder ones and the CBD varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: as a whole was that they came from this
other pool with these other traits in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition to being CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've never really been a big Afghan
consumer myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, and also it opened up the whole
discussion of whether, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is this, do I like, do I like this
Cambodian because it's a one to one or do
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like it because it's a low THC
variety, because there's something about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, these 10, 12% THC varieties that
are just completely approachable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compared to, you know, higher THC
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but it's just really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smokes really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I'm just looking at it right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it goes into later into the fall,
it's putting on a lot of really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a nice plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so many cool little tibids in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, first of all, to, to get an
equatorial that's putting on some nice
[SPEAKER_03]: color.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I always say to people that it's a
bit of a rarity to see that, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: really, really interesting, but I want to
probe a little bit deeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm interested to go down that line
of thought about how it is like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, lower cannabinoids, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there is the one-to-one component and
yet it's still really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I share that sort of thought
you expressed about like wondering over
[SPEAKER_03]: the years, what is the CBD actually doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it, is it just bringing the high down?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in a sort of, in a, in a way that I'm
not looking for per se.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd love to hear your thoughts on why
do you think it's just that the fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: like it's offering this unique effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the cannabinoids don't need to be so
sky high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a bit of a followup, I've asked
people for a long time, why is it that
[SPEAKER_03]: like land races, generally speaking,
don't have a ceiling or a less likely to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a lot of the modern strains,
you smoke them all day and you sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: only get so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of these older varieties,
especially, you know, the one people talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about is like haze and Thai, Mexican,
some of the components of haze they're
[SPEAKER_03]: like, man, you just, you keep smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You keep getting higher and higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I almost felt like you were sort of
getting to that point when you were
[SPEAKER_03]: describing the Cambodian.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to hear, why do you feel that
like some of these land race varieties or
[SPEAKER_03]: more raw sort of genetic building blocks
have that ability?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think we've lost when we get
to a point where OG can't do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, and let me just back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just say that I, when I say a
Cambodian variety, you know, nobody,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's, there's level,
there's degrees of, of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how sure are you that something is really
what it's supposed to be in terms of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, germplasm, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it came from Cambodia that I can,
I can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person who sourced it got it from
someone that they trust, but that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that it has a whole bunch of other
things in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that CBD component and the color
component came from modern weed that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been in Cambodia for decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always really hard to know what,
you know, what really is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and it's Cambodian derived and it has
Cambodian influence and it came from a
[SPEAKER_00]: Cambodian grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all we can really say about
most modern germplasm, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we want, you know, I mean,
and hopefully through genomic work,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we could, you know, we could
unravel a little bit more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still hard to do because we lost
a lot of the original data to reference
[SPEAKER_00]: all the original reference points.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, and this on the, the potency and the
ceiling thing, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you know, there's, there's
something about how certain varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: burn, burn you out kind of, is what I've
always noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like certain things you need, like this
recovery period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some, I mean, someone once
hypothesized that that was like a hydroxy
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 thing that over time, you're going to
build up hydroxy 11 in your system and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to feel tired and lazy from
just a large dose of THC running through
[SPEAKER_00]: your blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's it, or if it's an
aroma profile thing, something to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: the entourage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But early on in my life, I noticed that
certain varieties, if you smoke them
[SPEAKER_00]: before another variety, specifically,
you know, like more Afghan leaning things,
[SPEAKER_00]: versus more quote unquote sativa leaning,
that it kind of like, if you smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this, this was my experience
specifically with like Sage and OG,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that if you smoked OG first,
it was really hard to feel the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sage afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't because there wasn't enough
potency in the Sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just because there was something to
the effect of this other plant that put up
[SPEAKER_00]: like a barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't, the only thing you can do
to crush through that barrier is to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of reset maybe your, your receptors so
that they can accept something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it generally takes time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you, you know, that's why people
smoke cannabis in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got that wake and bake is because
they got that fresh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: receptor, you know, effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always wondered if there was
something in these other varieties that
[SPEAKER_00]: have no ceiling, quote unquote,
no ceiling, in that the onset of the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect and the way you're accumulating it
in your body just never creates this big
[SPEAKER_00]: wall that you can't get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can keep kind of stacking and
stacking on it because it's an uplifting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all those varieties that they
were quote unquote ceilingless,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they are tend to be,
you know, uplifting varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they got a little bit more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not, you're having to break
through the fog, you know, so to speak of
[SPEAKER_00]: something that really puts you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but there's also, there is some kind
of common effect, you know, and I've one
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting thing that I've noticed is
that people at times have assumed that
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the cultivars that I've developed
or presented are lower potency than they
[SPEAKER_00]: are that like, oh, this feels like a 17%
variety where they're actually like 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's such a different feeling that
people are assumed to because like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and racy varieties, you know, are like
racy and uplifting until they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're harder to perceive versus
just something that just puts you in your
[SPEAKER_00]: chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, yeah, I don't know,
it's, it's, I think it's puzzling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, but there's, but there's so much
more to potency, I think is the real
[SPEAKER_00]: question here is like, what is potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: We really don't have a handle on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not just like alcohol where
you can drink two or three, you can drink
[SPEAKER_00]: a 5% beer, you can drink four of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, or you can drink two 10% beers and
you're gonna have the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with cannabis, there seems to be some
type of a time duration thing where the
[SPEAKER_00]: onset of the effect is going through this
kind of this arc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you put on it after that is also
having an impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just as simple as stacking the
potency you would the way you would with
[SPEAKER_00]: like ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, what all the other compounds that
are in play are shaping the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, the whatever it is that is
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, to me that that that's,
that's why, you know, you hear people
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking sativas in the morning and indicas
at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is because it's not just because sativas
are appropriate for morning, which they
[SPEAKER_00]: are because they're less lethargic and,
you know, sleepy and disassociative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also that you can keep smoking
sativas through the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the night with indicas and you
still have kind of a functioning effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you smoke heavy indicas all
day, and then you turn to that sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: that beautiful Cali mist, elegant high at
night, it like, it doesn't cut through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've got to like cut through
with like a chisel, you know, to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through the wall that you've put up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that chisel was increasing the
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why people, you know,
smoke dabs and all this other stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's like, you're now forcing the
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when your tolerance is fairly low,
obviously you need less.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just, anyway, I guess back to the
ceiling thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we even know, we can't even
look at what a ceiling is until we really
[SPEAKER_00]: address what potency is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just so, so complicated,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, you've given me so many good avenues
I could dive off into.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the first one I wanted to ask
you is sort of like a two-fold.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the first one is, I'd be interested to
hear how your relationship with tolerance
[SPEAKER_03]: and smoking might have changed over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly am going through a bit of a
transitionary phase, as I was mentioning
[SPEAKER_03]: to you a bit earlier, like I've got some
kids now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I find like I'm pretty consistently not
smoking until later in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then through doing that, as you were
just talking about, you know, your
[SPEAKER_03]: tolerance changes significantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for me personally, I found myself
enjoying these strains that I used to
[SPEAKER_03]: think were kind of a bit tame,
maybe back when I was smoking,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, more heavy chem stuff from Dawn
till Dusk.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd love to hear, you know,
how has your sort of relationship with
[SPEAKER_03]: tolerance changed over time?
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a follow on, and this is probably
the one where there's a bit more meat on
[SPEAKER_03]: the bone, but we often hear people talk
about being really fond of strains in the
[SPEAKER_03]: old days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll say, look, I had this cut of,
let's just, for just easy discussion sake,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll say, look, I have this purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to grow it all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the dopest stuff ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then nowadays, I grow it, same cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely not a different cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just not hitting the same,
but like, I swear to God, it was really
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And put aside all the other factors that
could be at play.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess what I'm wondering is,
is people talk about this idea of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, why did it seem so much better back
20 years ago?
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the reasons we hear people talk
about is that maybe it was the case that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, on average, the weed wasn't as
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like you'd go through these periods
where you'd have not the best weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, so when you did get something
good, like it was really memorable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then nowadays, when you grow that same
thing, it doesn't really strike you as
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly memorable.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, that's one of the best explanations
I've heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like I'm sure that if you were
smoking brick weed, when you got anything
[SPEAKER_03]: that was half good, you know, it'd be
quite memorable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I'd love to hear
your thoughts on why do you think that has
[SPEAKER_03]: changed?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, are strains getting weaker?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we just used to stronger stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: How is our relationship with tolerance
evolved as a community?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a fantastic question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really important because,
you know, we are coming out of prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are reintroducing ourselves to
cannabis in a big way on a global scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, how people consume
substances is relevant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's coffee or alcohol or sugar or
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a particularly long relationship
with consuming cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, I mean, I'm 54 years old and
I've probably been consuming for 55 years
[SPEAKER_00]: just because I grew up in a world where
cannabis was already normalized and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: always around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but that being said, it wasn't always
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't always around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always there, but not in the
quantities that I've most consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't in the quantities that the
consumers wanted it to be in or in the
[SPEAKER_00]: potency or the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are now having this Renaissance of
availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I do think that that has shaped
our tolerance in a big way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That even us, you know, people who always
had access or relative amount of access
[SPEAKER_00]: never could just turn to the left and open
a jar of some of the finest grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing genetics in the world anytime they
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so we've all, we've all upped
our tolerance for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that has changed the way a
classic cultivar works, the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: remember it because none of it,
and, you know, we've also increased our,
[SPEAKER_00]: our, our skill as a cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I'm looking back at Sage that
I grew 30 years ago and thinking about how
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it and under what kind of gear and
what type of environmental controls and
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking like, wow, what would,
what would that have been like if I could
[SPEAKER_00]: grow that same plant today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, you know, would have expressed
itself higher or what, but that also
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed higher in what that's also back
to the potency thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but I do think cannabis has been
potent for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that I don't think that we've,
I think there's this misconception that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've bred higher potency cannabis that as
an industry that we've kind of frankened
[SPEAKER_00]: that this frankenweed that we've,
our lab breeders went down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: underground and we took 6% cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, you know, what they were saying
based off of seizures that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we took it and wrote it up to 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a fallacy and a
misconception about how modern potency
[SPEAKER_00]: works that to me in, even in, in land race
based populations, if you went through
[SPEAKER_00]: enough seeds, you'd find outliers of all
different potency ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the, the outliers that
impacted modern cannabis are pretty old
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and arguably not even that far from
their land race source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bag seed that was imported crossed a
couple of times and then seeds reproduced,
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not decades and decades of, of,
of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember back in the day, we didn't
grow or breed indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it seasonally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you only had one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Selection a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't, basically to me,
what happened is that the, we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we learned how to clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people selected really potent
cultivars, we saved them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we shared them with the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in doing that, we shared high potency
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genes, you know, that, that, that whatever
that THC synthase, you know, ramped up,
[SPEAKER_00]: however, you know, to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is that breeding or is that selection
or is that distribution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, you know, disseminating founder
cultivars that brought those traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't take 6% THC and make it seven,
then eight, then 10, then 12, then 14,
[SPEAKER_00]: then 20, then 22, then 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was people found boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they shared it with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then everybody had material to use
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Material to use to ramp up their potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that wasn't through breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was through cloning and sharing
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, that's the way I,
I saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I know that the Sage that was
tested in 1998, tested at 21 point
[SPEAKER_00]: something percent THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stuff was, you know, my breeding
effort wasn't a big giant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was me making a few selections from
things that, you know, we're either in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem and also the things that I
brought back from, from Cali, but it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm just saying 30 years ago,
we had 20 plus percent clones that were
[SPEAKER_00]: going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my experience, growing cannabis
over, I mean, consuming cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout my whole life is that every now
and then you encountered some flower that
[SPEAKER_00]: knocked you out, like just really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing that is really sometimes
overlooked about, you know, potency and
[SPEAKER_00]: people waxing poetic about the flower they
smoked in the past is that in a pound of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in the seventies and eighties and
nineties, for one, it was almost all grown
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed, but it wasn't one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a pound of cannabis or
multiple, you know, large amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, it was homogenized batches of a
bunch of different seed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have a hundred different
plants in one batch all mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you weren't, if you, if someone,
a consumer bought an ounce of cannabis at
[SPEAKER_00]: the dead lot before clones were going
around, that one ounce could have had
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple, you know, plants in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were incredibly potent and
some of them weren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was always this kind of weird,
like every now and then you'd have this
[SPEAKER_00]: potent experience with cannabis and just
go like, Oh my God, do you remember that
[SPEAKER_00]: time we smoked that one thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I do believe that those were
potent varieties and they were probably
[SPEAKER_00]: also very high in THC, but you didn't get
five pounds of cannabis from someone in
[SPEAKER_00]: the seventies, eighties and nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all the same 25% THC clone grown
the same, you know, beautifully cared for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to have that consistent potent
experience was really rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even, even when you had good flower,
you were still fishing through,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, the potery or the melange
of all the different seed plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just the, just the ability to like
interact with that much consistent,
[SPEAKER_00]: high potency quality cannabis is super,
super new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would argue it's only five to 10
years old for most of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even in California, you know,
20 years ago, there was really amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, but it wasn't always everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't always grown really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, we're, we're, we're definitely
in this new, new realm of what is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what our tolerance levels are
and what, what our consumption habits
[SPEAKER_00]: should be in order to reflect our
tolerance, you know, to consume it both in
[SPEAKER_00]: a safe and productive, but also to get the
most benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really what the
tolerance discussion kind of speaks to is
[SPEAKER_00]: where does the most benefit for the
consumer lie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it really, when you have a high
tolerance and you do small amounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very potent, but you are consuming
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could argue that, you know,
consuming more of that substance might be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial for you for whatever reasons,
for pain relief or stress or, or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, inflammation or whatever,
if it's a medicinal reason, or if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just, you know, wanting to have a higher
tolerance so that you don't have any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the negative side effects associated with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's definitely something that you
could say that people who consume more can
[SPEAKER_00]: consume more, where people who consume
less have to be very careful about when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're consuming, because it can really
knock you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can, I can so deeply relate to
what you just said, as I was sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: explaining my, my own relationship with
consumption and tolerances changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, gosh, I tell you what,
I feel the munchies these days in a way
[SPEAKER_03]: that I didn't not so long ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's, it's so interesting
because your own personal relationship
[SPEAKER_03]: with cannabis can often, cause we are,
you know, we are so far in like the top
[SPEAKER_03]: one percentile of consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I often say, like, you know, anyone
listening to this show right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you're in the top one percentile,
like no one else is going to listen to
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it can become very, um, like a
typical, I guess, what I realized when I
[SPEAKER_03]: took a tolerance break recently was that I
became extremely lazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like basically I would, I'd get home from
work and want to do something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd just be like, Oh, I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I realized in those moments,
I would smoke a sativa and have the energy
[SPEAKER_03]: to go do that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought it was such an interesting
sort of observation because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so often the conversation is like,
Oh, you know, stone is no motivation,
[SPEAKER_03]: no energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that moment, I realized I was
actually the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, finding myself more lazy without
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, that sort of brings us to the
discussion about sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm someone who used to not be able to
consume them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just get so anxious.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I don't honestly know when,
but at some point I sort of just checked
[SPEAKER_03]: back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is over the course of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I checked back in and I sort of felt like
I could ride that horse a little better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're at the point and all of our
listeners will know where I just love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my favorite sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I'd love to ask you as someone who's
got, you know, a rich and wide experience
[SPEAKER_03]: with a range of sativas, including many of
the building block land races that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: all so, you know, keen to try.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you think we can help expose a
wider audience to the beauty of sativas?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because part of me thinks that a lot of
people, A, aren't aware of the creative
[SPEAKER_03]: and stimulative and, you know,
all these unique effects that sativas
[SPEAKER_03]: bring, you know, so often people are like,
oh, I just thought it was sedating.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we get the message out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we've sort of been talking,
you know, it doesn't need to be a 28% OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be a 15% sativa and it'll take
you somewhere totally different.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we try to get that message out
there or how do we just raise awareness in
[SPEAKER_03]: general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it just, and just, I have to say for
my, for my taxonomy brethren and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, for, for really,
this is for you, Rob, cannabis indica
[SPEAKER_00]: subspecies indica, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about narrow leaf varieties
and that we colloquially call sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, I think, and I also,
you know, I love the word sativa,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm happy to, I think it's a great,
you know, it's, it's part of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you know, we, the word strain as
opposed to cultivar, sometimes you just
[SPEAKER_00]: have to accept that it doesn't really have
to have the, the science, the meaning
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it for it to have the impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I love using the word sativa again,
more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think about what people wanted
cannabis to be, like what, and I know that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to like go deep down in the
rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of, you know, humanity and, you know,
our relationship with this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it is a weird one, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the, the endocannabinoid system
was in us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in our family tree before it was in
the plants family tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes back further in animals than it
does in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of cool how we, how we met.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at all cannabis around the
world, you know, up in until before,
[SPEAKER_00]: before the eighties really, it was mostly
these narrow leaf varieties, these kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: equatorial tropical varieties that we,
you know, if you think about Thai,
[SPEAKER_00]: Thai cannabis and, you know, Indian and,
you know, Vietnamese, Cambodian,
[SPEAKER_00]: African, South African, you know,
Malawi, Tanzania.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think of South America, you know,
Columbia and Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mexico and Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think of all these places and all
these selections that happened over a long
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all, I'm sure came from somewhat of a
narrow gene pool because it was an export
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people were selecting cannabis to be
something for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were working within whatever
population they had, but these populations
[SPEAKER_00]: are dynamic and there's the ability to
move the needle left or right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of steer in the selection,
how you want it, steer the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for whatever reason, they steered it
towards these, you know, electric,
[SPEAKER_00]: uplifting, psychedelic, soaring,
energizing varieties that were also potent
[SPEAKER_00]: and had, you know, all lots of other
attributes too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is kind of what we think of these
varieties as for being these sativas,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, these narrow leaf varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, think about how the other
class, the Afghani, the Indica chemotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that's appropriate, and I'm not a
scientist or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forgive me if I misuse any terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of an observer and I hang
out with a lot of cool scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have been gifted some cool knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you think about how that entered
the gene pool, at least from my
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, you know, growing up in
California and having family that grew
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in Big Sur, for instance,
is that Afghani gave them the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow a shorter plant that they could hide
in the brush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave them the ability to grow an
earlier flowering plant that they could
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest before, you know, some climate
issues, but also harvest before,
[SPEAKER_00]: initially harvest before camp came and
started seizing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gave a variety that you could grow
indoors, which was also about evading law
[SPEAKER_00]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave you a variety that was more
potent, you know, but it wasn't about,
[SPEAKER_00]: people weren't going, in my experience,
like, oh, wow, the effects of this new
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani stuff is so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now want to feel this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like all the breeders and
growers were selecting for these new
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were happy with the sativa as they
were growing before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just took on all these new traits
because they were agronomically friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They helped evade law enforcement,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to kind of to draw the
comparison between all these traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers around the world that grew and
smoked flower versus a hash producing
[SPEAKER_00]: region like Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're, you know, a small farmer,
you know, growing your your small plot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or just grows by you wherever,
and you observe an amazing plant and you
[SPEAKER_00]: consume that plant as since Amia or as
flower and the seeds fall out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you go, wow, that's amazing flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep these seeds and I'm
going to grow it again next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just that's how farmers work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're selecting from an individual
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get to interface with the plant,
you get to you get to consume the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you get to decide whether it fits
in with what you want, where your
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you grow with it or you breed
with it or you continue down that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in a hash making culture, like in
Afghanistan, they don't consume individual
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, you know, or I imagine it happens
very rarely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're taking a whole field and you're
homogenizing that and then you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: through, you're drying it in the sun and
then you're aging it and then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sieving it and agitating it and then
you're pressing it often with heat and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're drying it some more and then
you're consuming it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your only real selections are for like
resin content and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: higher yields of API of, you know,
that that active ingredient that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting into your hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not selecting for individual
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're never selecting for those
individual traits and you're not selecting
[SPEAKER_00]: for individual plant traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're selecting for hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so we kind of snuck in all these
genes and all these traits and all this
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry and compounds and things and
into our gene pool really quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just I question why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why we did that, you know, because it
wasn't necessarily just for the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the same time, because these
hybrids and stuff were so much more
[SPEAKER_00]: agronomically valuable really than these
narrowly varieties just because of how the
[SPEAKER_00]: yield and all the sativas fell out of
favor because they couldn't compete,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't on effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we slowly turned into just a
completely different cannabis consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, you know, and now, I mean,
I don't, you know, it's, I guess it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just, it's anecdotal to say that at the
same time that modern cannabis exploded
[SPEAKER_00]: out of prohibition, we are in a weird
disassociative state as a, as a people
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world and people are more
tapped out than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are also more anxious than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to have any anxiety
inducing substances in their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and there's, I mean, if you look at
opioid crisis and all this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, people may be in some weird way,
I hate to think it's this, this is true,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in some weird way, as we're now,
we were shifting the gene pool away from
[SPEAKER_00]: these narrowly varieties into this hybrid
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also shifting what the drug was
being used for, which was no longer about
[SPEAKER_00]: celebration and insightfulness and mind
expansion and communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about accommodating a new culture
of people who were tapped out and
[SPEAKER_00]: disassociated and need to just be numb as
much as possible, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you do introduce sativas to
people and they do sometimes have a
[SPEAKER_00]: negative reaction, I mean, maybe that's
part of the symptom of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: why is it, why is it hitting that vein now
in our lives in ways that it didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: before?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that is, I mean, that is one
of the inherent risks with cannabis use
[SPEAKER_00]: is, you know, that people can,
they can have negative side effects,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's also the risk of a lot of other
therapeutic substances.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that they don't have
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means you have to proceed
cautiously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of feel like when we,
when people have a negative effect from
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming a sativa that spins them out and
they have like a slight panic attack or
[SPEAKER_00]: they have that tachycardia thing,
they create these associations with that
[SPEAKER_00]: negative moment that carry on into their
regular consumption, where if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit more mindful or maybe,
you know, you set and setting wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: right, or you just accept that,
hey, shit happens in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can continue to consume these
sativas because they do deliver this other
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, you know, and like you said
earlier, you know, if you think about how
[SPEAKER_00]: people's lives were in the past when what,
what, what they needed cannabis to be for
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you know, and not 30 years ago,
but 300 years ago, you know, you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, people don't have the luxury to just
sit around and do nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, life happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go on the hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go and forage for food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go and collect firewood.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to dance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dance all night long and celebrate and
worship and do all the far out things that
[SPEAKER_00]: being human is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think people were selecting plants
that facilitated that in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you took that out of their lives,
then there's no need for that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so are we having a discussion about
why we should have sativas in our life is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably also a reason for why we should
have all the other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sativa is so, you know, accommodate
or, or, you know, um, go side by side
[SPEAKER_00]: with, but yeah, I'm, I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, I really, I think
cannabis can be a lot of things for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's the beauty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes it so complicated and
complex and interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you, like you mentioned the,
the 1%, it's like, but cannabis is for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the one percent that is so
involved in shaping what everybody sees
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as, or, or, or, you know,
delivering cannabis to the 99%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, we have this responsibility,
almost like an ethical responsibility to
[SPEAKER_00]: help them get to the right place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is to me is really important because
we, if you think about, if everyone was
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming more sativas versus more hybrids
and more, you know, Afghani varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: people's lives would be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means, who knows, but it does
mean it would be different because like
[SPEAKER_00]: you said, you'd get up and go do the
cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd get shit done, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's, I mean, I, before I forget first
point, apologies, Rob for the incorrect
[SPEAKER_03]: nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's such a conundrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I always think to myself,
well, I use the word sativa because I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: just wanting the person I'm talking to,
to understand, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're using the same term essentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you think, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what really I'm saying is, is when a
majority of people adopt the new
[SPEAKER_03]: nomenclature, then I'll do it because then
we'll be talking the same language,
[SPEAKER_03]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, so then I feel guilty and I'm
like, Oh, so I'm not being part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, we'll, we'll get there one
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: My apologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, I guess just to continue that
train of thought a bit more forward,
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask you, um, like how do you
see the mode of delivery of cannabis as,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you were talking about how the way
in which we've consuming it and the needs
[SPEAKER_03]: have changed over say 300 years,
which undeniably true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess just over the next like 50
years, like I can't help, but feel like I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to say like it's following the
path of alcohol, but in a certain sense,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're seeing like the, the more mass
appealing, more economical option in this
[SPEAKER_03]: space.
[SPEAKER_03]: You often hear people saying like,
look, it seems undeniable.
[SPEAKER_03]: The vape pens are sort of filling that
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And heck, even I meet people all the time
who like, we're not really cannabis people
[SPEAKER_03]: who have now got a vape pen, so handy,
so discreet, all these beneficial things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess what it ultimately leads me
wondering is, is it going to be like what
[SPEAKER_03]: I fear?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause as, as like a breeder myself,
I fear that loss of genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, we all fear this,
but I worry that it's going to become like
[SPEAKER_03]: wine where it's like, we narrow ourselves
down to like these 40 or so accepted
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even within those 40, there's just
like five that get used most of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't help, but feel we're following
down that same path where, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: OGs, R&A and runs as cab sav.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just with those two alone,
you've covered a huge swath of consumers
[SPEAKER_03]: in terms of they're like, yep,
I'll happily take that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know obviously it's a bit of a
stretch in terms of an analogy,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think there are some elements that
are, you know, comparisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to hear what, what's your
thoughts on the future delivery?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think we might follow a similar
model where we get to this point where it
[SPEAKER_03]: is just a small handful of accepted
varietals?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think, I mean, the one thing
that's always going to be different for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and wine is wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the diversity in wine is just around
flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no chemical diversity in terms
of the drug side of wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe a little bit, you could
argue that, you know, some, some different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of alcohol have a slightly different
effect, whether it's whiskey or vodka or
[SPEAKER_00]: wine or beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's obviously a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of chemistry there,
but the main driver is one single thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis will always be more
complicated than that in that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of drivers to create this effect,
which we still don't fully understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the issue is and why I do
think it will follow like wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it'll follow like a lot of
other products or commodity, agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: commodities is that you can't create a
functioning supply chain with that much
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so it's like, it's not about the
diversity in the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the diversity in the supply
chain, which ultimately means the
[SPEAKER_00]: selection of the consumer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this whole paradox of choice
thing where if you give people too many
[SPEAKER_00]: choices, they can't make a selection
analysis paralysis, where it's just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's just, I just see too many
stars, like picking out a star in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Milky way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that with cannabis more than
any other crop, especially considering
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the top crop, you know, in a state
like California or in the U S you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the farmer has to pick from
thousands of cultivars essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the distributor has to decide what to
purchase the retail has to describe this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, decide what to put on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the consumer has to decide what
to purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, there's either it just,
it, it crashes, the whole system falls
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing is like,
and the farmer has to do this every cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: ever every year, because it keeps
changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no foundation to grow on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no like people don't grow the same
cultivar four years in a row in four
[SPEAKER_00]: different places in the U S in order to
have like agronomic data on how it grows
[SPEAKER_00]: well or to, you know, to, you know,
even for breeding to exist, like breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: up, you know, improving crop improvement
is about, you know, you got to select the
[SPEAKER_00]: crop first and then improve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you spend five years breeding
a cultivar that nobody wants anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that, you know, so, so that to me is
the issue is like, you know, you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain the diversity in the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to make sure that you always
have the ability to pivot and all the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the complexity and all the chemistry is
represented in the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you want to drive
products to the consumer in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: meets their needs and demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while doing that, you want to create a
functioning supply chain so that the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer can feed their family and the
retail shop is open and everyone's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you do that without limiting
diversity?
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's about creating the lanes of,
you know, these kind of bulk lanes of what
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis can be in terms of their
chemistry, which is really hard and really
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated because that requires,
you know, the consumer to learn about all
[SPEAKER_00]: these things, just like we're to the point
that we mentioned before about sativas,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but that to me is the only way
to really create a functioning supply
[SPEAKER_00]: chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I hear these words cultivar
dependent so much as a disclaimer in our
[SPEAKER_00]: industry for like, oh, the reason we
couldn't, you know, we can't tell you what
[SPEAKER_00]: the light recipe for these, you know,
this with these LED lights, cause it's
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar dependent, or we can't tell you,
you know, what the nutrient schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: should be, or whether this is susceptible
to powdery mildew in this region or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's cultivar dependent or we can't
tell you, you know, so we can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: build this bigger functioning supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last thing we want to do is to end
up with limited diversity and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Rob and I have written,
we write, we have a column in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: business times called growing pains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of highlights a lot of the
challenges of like these transitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you see, you saw like in
apples, for instance, apples are also a
[SPEAKER_00]: colonally produced, very heterozygous
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the diversity in apples was just
narrowed and narrowed and narrowed and
[SPEAKER_00]: narrowed to the point where we just had
like Granny Smith and Red Delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a few other apples were
just like, that's like, you have a green
[SPEAKER_00]: apple and you have a red apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cause they need to be these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be, you need to transport
well, they need to be shelf stable and
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to pests and blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they narrowed the gene pool to the
point where, you know, people demanded a
[SPEAKER_00]: better apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, you know, we see this big,
you know, emerging apple breeding industry
[SPEAKER_00]: where we've got all these amazing Fujis
and Honeycrisps and all these really
[SPEAKER_00]: groovy apples of today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was because Ag stepped in and
said, no, we need to dumb things down and
[SPEAKER_00]: simplify it so that we can create the
supply chain that functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need, we do need to do that with
cannabis because we do need to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we do, I mean, especially for
the farmer, I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the consumer really is the two people
that move, miss out the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumer is not getting the chemistry
that they could.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're not getting access to the
plants, the diversity of what the chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: profile could be because they're getting
so much of, you know, lemon cherry gelato
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, or so much of blue dream or
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the grower, the farmers really,
you know, just can't build a robust model
[SPEAKER_00]: of production when they constantly are
chasing their tail for like, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what, I don't know what to grow next
season that's going to sell, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, it's, that to me is,
and I think that there's probably like a
[SPEAKER_00]: fixed number in terms of like,
what that analysis paralysis number is for
[SPEAKER_00]: all crops where you can have a huge amount
of diversity in rice or you can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge amount of diversity in some other
crop, but in each individual market,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't, like, I'll give an example and
this might, I don't know if this might be
[SPEAKER_00]: even going down the hole too much,
but years ago, a friend had this idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a, a, a cannabis bird book that we
would kind of copy the Audubon Society's
[SPEAKER_00]: bird book for consumers so that they could
learn about the different varieties of
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultivars and they could go to
dispensaries and they would know what,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just like someone who buys a
bird book could get observed binoculars
[SPEAKER_00]: and goes to the park and they can spot a
bird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after we started doing a little
research, just like 10 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: or so, and started to do a little research
and I started to compile some stuff and I
[SPEAKER_00]: started to go, wait a second, for one,
people don't even agree on what the name
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bird is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every dispensary you go to,
just like every park you go to,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a whole bunch of different birds
and you don't see those birds at the other
[SPEAKER_00]: park, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go to one dispensary and you learn
these 10 varieties that are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I love these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go to another, like,
how come you guys don't have any of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or they just renamed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be something else, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the consumer is just completely out of
the loop and can't ever figure out what is
[SPEAKER_00]: a house finch or what's a red tail hawk or
what anything is because we've
[SPEAKER_00]: overcomplicated things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've almost sold the dream of the fino
hunt and the whole unicorn searching thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to the consumer as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that prevents the supply chain on their
side ever from developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't become the informed
consumer, where at least in wine,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you're totally right, I mean,
here in California, I think the numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: are exactly the same where it's like maybe
even two or three varieties produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: bulk of the whole state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the consumer learns the different
appellations, the consumer learns the
[SPEAKER_00]: different varieties, the consumer learns a
bit, and they over time learn where their
[SPEAKER_00]: preferences are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, once again, that's just for
aroma, that's just for mouthfeel and sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot easier for someone to be a
wine snob than to be a weed snob.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do learn and it takes time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a long time for, you know,
the French and Italian wine industry to
[SPEAKER_00]: create that culture and that knowledge
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took California a long time to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to take a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main thing is to build that
consumer base that really has that ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to say like, this is what I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have to experience it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it means everyone's got to kind of step
up and take some risks to actually present
[SPEAKER_00]: unique chemistry, unique plant,
you know, aroma profiles, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just, you know, dumbed down to the
lowest common denominator, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I hate to say it, but you know,
we're in this weird candy gas world where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, dessert flavors sell really
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe even just because they,
your mind thinks of dessert before you
[SPEAKER_00]: consume it or whatever, you know,
it's just, you're on a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to figure out how to get brands
that can kind of like cultivate and curate
[SPEAKER_00]: an experience for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the consumer becomes informed and the
consumer drives the breeder's and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators to continue to provide the
products that they demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: That to me is like the only way to bring
in a super long-winded way to bring back
[SPEAKER_00]: sativas for one is because, you know,
unlike Amsterdam in the nineties,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the Dutch coffee shops,
they would pay you more for a sativa and
[SPEAKER_00]: they pay you more for organically grown
because they knew you as a grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: it costs you more to grow something that
was longer flowering and lower yielding,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but they knew they had to have it on
the, on the, on the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why even today, I bet you it's
probably an artifact of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Amsterdam, there's more Hayes varieties
than there is in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Hayes is still all over Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, last I checked, it's still there
and like try to walk into dispensaries in
[SPEAKER_00]: LA and get PIF and super silver Hayes and
original Hayes and devil's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, five Hayes and like,
it's just not around because people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it because people won't pay what it
takes to grow, you know, 14 to 20 week
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that yields less than the eight or
nine week plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many really good points there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to quickly follow up with,
with, with what you just said in mind,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do you think is the future of home
growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think it will look like?
[SPEAKER_03]: As time goes on, because I mean,
at the moment, the trajectory seems that
[SPEAKER_03]: more and more sort of small mom and pop
businesses getting pushed out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just as a general sentiment,
like I don't have figures at my disposal
[SPEAKER_03]: to quote, but like, it seems like less and
less people are growing as time goes by to
[SPEAKER_03]: a certain extent and bigger operations are
popping up in their place.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does the future of homegrown look
like to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a followup, do you think that
homegrown will still lead the way in the
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of changing market innovation of like
Australian popularity?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think that there's still a
strong argument to be made that everything
[SPEAKER_03]: up until now has all relatively speaking,
come from the smaller grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, especially if you look at like Mac
and then onto runs and of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the OG and all that was all in
garages.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, I guess, you know, nowadays you
could say, well, the most popular thing at
[SPEAKER_03]: the moment is kind of like the RS 11 and
that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you could still make a small
argument that that stuff, even though
[SPEAKER_03]: those guys do have a little bit more room
at their disposal, it's still not glass
[SPEAKER_03]: house.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not like that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from my point of view, all the new
strains that take the market by storm come
[SPEAKER_03]: from the small growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of what you were saying in
the last answer in that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: expressing, this is what we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the effects and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that that will continue?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think at some point,
big facilities will take over and start
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, surprisingly, we haven't
seen a clone take over the market where
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like, this was founded glass house in
a 1 million seat, finger hunt or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a bit of a complex question,
but I'd love to hear your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think plant, plant people are
weird like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, I mean, you know, I grow a bunch
of different you know, I don't have a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I just rent a house here in
Ventura County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but I remember last year I sat down
with my kids and we cropped, we had 35
[SPEAKER_00]: different edible plants grown in the
backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them were really scraggly and
just surviving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember we had like six different
types of tomatoes and there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes in the backyard than they're at
the grocery store variety wise,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, like the, the bigger,
more diverse variety of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and like when I go to, I used to go
to this little nursery in West LA that had
[SPEAKER_00]: all these amazing tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just use that as an example because
tomatoes also were heavily, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bottlenecked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these varieties I've never even
heard of, I've never heard their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got stripes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are round, some of them are
pear shaped, some of them are orange,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them are yellow, some of them are
purple, some of them are black,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you realize like there's a whole world
of tomato breeders and tomato enthusiasts
[SPEAKER_00]: in this horticultural side that it's
always going to be there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over the years you started to see
those varieties slowly pop up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw heirloom tomatoes come back,
you know, for years people used to think,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, we can't afford to grow heirlooms
because they, they don't transport well
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't, you know, last that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who's going to pay, you know,
$4 a pound for a tomato when they can grow
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them for a dollar or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, there's a lot of
people who will pay $4 a pound for
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes if they're really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's this kind of like
this plant hobbyist passion thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps the genetic diversity going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily, a lot of those guys still
even, they even work for commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you meet plenty of growers
who have insane amount of diversity in
[SPEAKER_00]: their home and all this weird stuff that
they could never grow commercially because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're at a loss, you wouldn't ever let
them do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not going to stop them,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that that's encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say this a lot, you know,
and it's, you know, I don't know where,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to me, the cannabis is like a coyote
and then it's super elusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you can't really train it
or capture it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really clever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right when you think you've figured
out, you know, what it is or what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be or whatever, it just pivots
and it becomes something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's part of the part of
the nature and the chemical complexity is
[SPEAKER_00]: that we'll never be able to just rein it
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll always take these backyard
enthusiasts and the horticultural side to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep feeding the ag side, you know,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because cannabis, I think, you know,
like there's two tracks that we're on
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is one is exploring the complexity
around the human plant relationship,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, emerging out of prohibition and
people are trying cannabis for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time and all these new delivery systems
and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really complicated and it's like
can be many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be, you know, non-psychoactive
even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the other side is just the
very simple nature of cannabis as a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that's grown by people like other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's actually a pretty fairly easy
plant to grow, grows in a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very elastic to different ways of
being cultivated and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, outdoors, little plants,
big plants, vining plants, bushing plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: creeping plants, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like it really wants to grow as,
you know, like it really wants to thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other side of it that how and why
we need to have the plant is way more
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing that I fear that we
might lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, you know, in this reemergence
that all these isolated populations of
[SPEAKER_00]: people around the world that created this
diversity, you know, pre-prohibition or up
[SPEAKER_00]: into and through prohibition, all of that
is about to experience the same dynamic as
[SPEAKER_00]: modern agriculture, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis isn't even scalable like
modern agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will never be grown like wheat or corn
or rice because we don't need that much of
[SPEAKER_00]: it for drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we're growing it for food or
fiber, for grain and fiber, then it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that it can be treated like ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can't treat it like an agricultural
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't treat it like grapes or apples
because we don't need to grow that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to be careful how we put it in
the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really fit in the way other
products do, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you talk about pharma and big ag
getting into cannabis, it'll never be
[SPEAKER_00]: those things, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a limited amount of this crop that
needs to be produced for people,
[SPEAKER_00]: drug type, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to be really cautious about
scaling it up and letting ag and letting
[SPEAKER_00]: big companies move in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in theory, just a few people can
grow I mean, a few groups could grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of the cannabis for the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not like corn and rice where
you just need millions and millions and
[SPEAKER_00]: millions and millions and millions of
acres to feed the bulk of the calories for
[SPEAKER_00]: all of humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis consumption about how many people
need, you know, how much each person needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to consume of this plant is relatively
small compared to the other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like we got to, because of the
smallness of it, we have to have a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more of a big picture about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if that, you know,
speaks to what you asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, to me, that's the challenge
around the diversity is that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's something that's incredibly diverse,
but you also don't need that much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a drug, it's a substance,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a staple like other big crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, God forbid someone should
just mass produce the Red Delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: version of cannabis, then it just becomes
one thing, you know, and that could easily
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it could be mandated that way
through regulations that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis has to be this because,
you know, whatever body decided that it
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be the other thing, you know,
when we decided potency can't be beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: this amount, and it shouldn't have too
much of that or shouldn't have too much of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's maybe that complexity
around creating those guidelines is part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the reason why it hasn't happened
because it's not alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as simple as just regulating it
based off of one thing, which is ethanol,
[SPEAKER_00]: or one thing, which is THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became all these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of CBD was the gatekeeper for
that, just saying, oh, my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be something totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look how much that really helped push
the discussion forward by changing
[SPEAKER_00]: people's opinions on what it is,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want it to, we want to have that
diversity and that ability to pivot and
[SPEAKER_00]: that ability to change opinions and to
produce different products and to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so yeah, it needs to stay
diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needs to stay in our backyards and
we need more custodians and shepherds than
[SPEAKER_00]: ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can, I can totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess as a, as a quick follow on,
do you have any thoughts on what we might
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to do to help safeguard some
amount of the genetic diversity outside of
[SPEAKER_03]: just consumer demand?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like in an ideal world,
consumers would demand that diversity and
[SPEAKER_03]: then easy fix, you know, the companies are
going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess I'm interested in trying to
think like, I don't even know if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: possible, but is there some way to try to
help ensure it stays around, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: even in the absence of that, I'm not
entirely sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a, as a quick follow on,
do you fear that you know, some of the big
[SPEAKER_03]: ag companies are really sort of licking
their chops at the ideas of real
[SPEAKER_03]: commercialized cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when I was writing the
questions for this, I, I jokingly thought
[SPEAKER_03]: to myself, like, you know, do you think
there's a whiteboard somewhere in Monsanto
[SPEAKER_03]: where they've already got a Terminator
gene in mind for some, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Malawi or something like, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your thoughts on preserving the
genetics and do you think that we're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to go down a dark path?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, well, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not, I don't think we're
going on a darker path with cannabis than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just the nature of,
you know, the modern system, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The modern manuscript.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consumerism and you know, the way we
engage with products, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't always make the best
decisions with the food that they eat or
[SPEAKER_00]: the cars they buy or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't expect them all to become
informed cannabis consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep the diversity alive based off of
their, their consumption needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is definitely up to us, you know,
to have a little bit more play a bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a role in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's why, you know,
honestly, the home grower is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important that way because the pressures
on the agronomic side don't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone's got some plants in the
backyard, they don't really care if they
[SPEAKER_00]: come in in the first week of October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the last week of October, as long as
they don't mold out or all the way into
[SPEAKER_00]: December, even, you know, or, you know,
whether they're in their tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that grows for nine weeks or 10 weeks,
doesn't really have a big impact where
[SPEAKER_00]: like the CFO for your big company is like,
might say nothing over nine weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it can never happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in this facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, so that is,
I think that's really important to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and that is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I'm not afraid of that
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I do worry about is the over
commodification of like the, the internet,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if cannabis overnight became an
international, like we'll be back,
[SPEAKER_00]: back it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like think about what would have happened
to cannabis if prohibition never happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it just fell, fell the regular track,
because think about how cannabis was,
[SPEAKER_00]: is an ancient crop, but industrial
agriculture was just getting rolling as
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, an industrial agricultural would
have happened to cannabis for the past 80
[SPEAKER_00]: some years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we would have lost a lot of
that diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's, it's, it's kind of like the
blowback of these guys who tried to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, put cannabis in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ended up opening it up in a way that
they could never imagine in the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the diversity in these land raised
populations and the diversity around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world might've had a big impact from
prohibition, but the marketplace
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity, I think was, was a big gift
because it would have been definitely,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's just, if you think of,
you know, when you, when you look at a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a large field of cannabis and you see some
varieties that do well and some don't to
[SPEAKER_00]: big ag, they're just like, okay,
we only grow the ones that do well,
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of, you know, what anyone
thinks, you know, we're going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to move in one direction,
you know, and that's how you end up with
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of moving forward,
I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's really hard to see how big ag
and the Monsanto's of the world could
[SPEAKER_00]: really capture cannabis from, could
capture the diversity and limit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the cat's out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know like, what's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know like in the, Rob told me this story
years ago about the, the, the wine
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in the USSR being completely
bottlenecked because they had decided they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to grow this only one or two
varieties for mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for the whole, for the whole
USSR, we don't, we don't need the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to streamline it for distribution
and yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but it was the guys, it was the
gardeners who kept, you know, vines in
[SPEAKER_00]: their backyard that kept all that
diversity and were able to reinvigorate
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the wine industry after the USSR
fell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, I'm not really worried about the
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm worried more about like the social
experiment of cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: of like what, and, and, you know,
you see like gummies and vape pens like
[SPEAKER_00]: have definitely taken over.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a big way, because they're socially
more approachable and they fit into
[SPEAKER_00]: people's lifestyles easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I sometimes wonder, you know,
if, if we're going to fit in cannabis the
[SPEAKER_00]: right way back to that, you know,
why are we growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is there so much Afghan influence in
modern cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And not that there's a right or a wrong
way, but is it, is it going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial for humanity in some kind of
way?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a kind of a lofty,
a lofty, you know, thought, but I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally feel like there's, that there
definitely, that there has been something
[SPEAKER_00]: lost in modern weed, you know,
that there's just a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe it's, maybe it's cause aroma
and, you know, loud cannabis has like
[SPEAKER_00]: become so much more popular, but just some
subtle nuances that I think would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope no one takes offense when I say
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you said that, it reminds me of like,
you know, when Nietzsche is proclaiming
[SPEAKER_03]: the death of God, you know, it's like
something's changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to articulate, but there's a
little something that's changed and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of undeniable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I agree with all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is, that is cool to hear that
story about the USSR and how, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like there will be people much like our
listeners and ourselves who will likely be
[SPEAKER_03]: safeguards for some of these genetics
long-term, but I want to give people who
[SPEAKER_03]: might not have the pleasure of knowing
your backstory a bit more information,
[SPEAKER_03]: which will help ground some of these
answers a bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after where I think what one hour deep,
let's ask our usual first question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me about your first experience with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can't remember my first
experience because I mean, we,
[SPEAKER_00]: my parents both found cannabis early in
their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad was from Alabama and my mom was
from Florida and they both found cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: as young adults and decided to move to
California in the early sixties on
[SPEAKER_00]: separate paths and met actually my mom and
dad met in the middle of night over a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint, you know, because that was the word
that they lived in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's always been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been a part of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been somewhat normalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say some of my earliest memories in
life are watching, you know, a pipe or a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint go around the circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the youngest of six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, you know, my oldest brother is 10
years older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So consumption was just normal all around
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and cultivation to some extent as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was always there, you know,
and the smell was always there and the
[SPEAKER_00]: people were always there and the plant was
always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's just been kind of the
background of my life in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of the, the connective
tissue with the community that I grew up
[SPEAKER_00]: in was cannabis and they were back to the
land beat neck people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born in Big Sur, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1969.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that point, you know, there are
already a little bit of a community there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the first places where you
could argue there was kind of a new world
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis culture and, and industry a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were cultivating and selling and
celebrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Sur had the, the harvest parties,
which started in 67 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through family friends that lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents were living at a place,
I think it was Plaskett Creek and Big Sur,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they invited a friend to come and stay
with us and him and his family and 66 or
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was Patrick Cassidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we moved from Plaskett and then
Patrick came up and started growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by, I think 67 started having
these harvest parties where people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, could kind of freely come and
celebrate and they would, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd be a sea of VW buses and,
and, you know, hippies and back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Landers and beat necks and musicians and
all kinds of far out people who would come
[SPEAKER_00]: to Big Sur and kind of feel open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was, that was where it all started
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a young adult, sorry,
as a young child, we moved to New York
[SPEAKER_00]: city and then to Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my older brother stayed in Big Sur or
moved back to Big Sur by 77 or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that and cultivated in, in Big Sur
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my, my strong relationship
with the plant and the community and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that was definitely founded in Big Sur,
even though I still live most of my life
[SPEAKER_00]: in SoCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my fam, part of my family was there
and that's where most of the herb we
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed was grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where, that's where it all
started for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a, what an incredible introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it sounds like it's been there the
whole time, which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your experience with it goes so deep.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to hear, first off, do you ever
have any recollection of your parents ever
[SPEAKER_03]: telling you of what they can consider to
be really memorable herb or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what, what do you think it was like for
them?
[SPEAKER_03]: What were they consuming?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it import?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the early stuff produced in
California?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they ever tell you much about their
experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had a very close relationship with
both my parents and we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad was, you know, also imported a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the late sixties and early seventies
and, and grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but actually here's a funny story is
I actually asked my mom about the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time she consumed a cannabis, which would
have been in Gainesville, Florida in 1959
[SPEAKER_00]: or 1960 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked her like specifics about like
the joint and how big it was and how many
[SPEAKER_00]: people smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened when they smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell you back to the potency thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her description sure was of some people
who got really, really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they got, they went through the
full, you know, the full just giggles and
[SPEAKER_00]: wacky and then philosophical, the paranoid
and all of that stuff off of a little,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, between four people couldn't had
to be a quarter gram of import,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, flour from that they got from,
you know, their beatnik friend who knew
[SPEAKER_00]: guys at the jazz club or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but I always thought that was
interesting because it wasn't like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the story of like smoking,
you know, seventies homegrown that was
[SPEAKER_00]: leafy and barely got you high or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, no, whatever they smoked
worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, but yeah, the, the,
the Big Sur was all about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the most part, it was all mostly
Mexican varieties grown there into the
[SPEAKER_00]: seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, with some Colombian
and Panamanian and a little bit of Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the mid seventies,
the African influence came in from Malawi,
[SPEAKER_00]: the corn cops and 76, 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were all, I mean, that was,
that was kind of the, that was part of why
[SPEAKER_00]: I had this, this big imprint on these
narrowly varieties is because all my early
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction with cannabis was all this,
not the same process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more of a profile, but some common,
common ground, let's just say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in terms of effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we, we, we saw a lot and saw a
lot of cannabis import throughout my youth
[SPEAKER_00]: too, you know, cannabis every,
you know, if people bought and sold from
[SPEAKER_00]: all around the world and, and people were
often bringing in, you know, things from,
[SPEAKER_00]: from everywhere, you know, coffee tins
from Hawaii and not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see, honestly, I never saw a lot
of like brick weed and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_00]: until like my teenage years when my other
friends would present flour that they
[SPEAKER_00]: found stuff, but saw a lot of interesting
different profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just, I guess the one thing that
would, it was a big imprint on me as a kid
[SPEAKER_00]: is how visually different cannabis used to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: From region to region and from,
you know, from variety to variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: just visually stimulating big,
big spears and balls and bright red hairs
[SPEAKER_00]: and orange hairs and lime green and dark
green and golden and brown and purple and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can only imagine, especially
when it was so sort of raw and coming from
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the land race spot in many,
many instances, that would have been
[SPEAKER_03]: really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, certainly one of the frequently
asked fan submitted questions from our
[SPEAKER_03]: Patreon listeners was many of them sort of
asked multiple, like many questions,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they all sort of fell into one of two,
you know, broader questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one being, what was it like to
grow in the Big Sur area itself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because many people commented quite a
foggy area, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's high humidity, I'm assuming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just issues with moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what was that like?
[SPEAKER_03]: And did that lend itself, I guess,
a bit to the fact that you guys were
[SPEAKER_03]: growing a lot of sativas?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that part of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as a follow-up to that,
can you tell us a bit about, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the fabled Big Sur Holyweed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, definitely people were growing
all sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that susceptibility to mold and
mildew wasn't really nearly as much of an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, but people were also growing up out
of the fog line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, up on the ridges where you
could, you know, get out into the sun,
[SPEAKER_00]: made a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big difference, obviously, you know,
for certain varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Big Sur Holyweed is,
it's the story of stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's one of the few,
like, you know, it's the, it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: Acapulco goals of the US, you know,
so it's, it's filled with lore and I'm,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, totally responsible for part of
the misinformation that's been spread
[SPEAKER_00]: around over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can give you the, the story,
the, the story as I know it, and then all
[SPEAKER_00]: the different versions that are told,
which are all much more interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially Patrick Cassidy,
who was the one who did the harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: parties and was really one of the first,
you know, commercial growers in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was growing flour and a friend,
another family friend, said, hey man,
[SPEAKER_00]: your weed is like Holyweed, you know,
and that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then that became Big Sur Holyweed
and it was predominantly Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, is you got to remember
people didn't clone, people didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can get into like in a minute,
if you want to talk about how Cincinnati
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of came about, because that book was
really, was written by family friends as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so the idea that Big Sur Holyweed was
a line or this lineage, it really was a
[SPEAKER_00]: class.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really good weed grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And originally it was weed grown by
Patrick, you know, but it could have been
[SPEAKER_00]: of various descent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then it quickly became such a
brandable thing that a lot of growers who
[SPEAKER_00]: grew in Big Sur were calling their flour
Big Sur Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that stretched all the way into the
80s and all the way past way beyond when
[SPEAKER_00]: all the different hybridization happened,
people were still selling it as Big Sur
[SPEAKER_00]: Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the truth behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like an appellation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like just Big Sur Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good bud from Big Sur, you know,
which is also what I've heard the Alaska
[SPEAKER_00]: Thunderfuck story from some guys I met in
up Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, that's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alaskan, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good herb from the valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Matanuska Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the, you know, whatever,
you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so that is, that is the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of the story for me was that
when I, when I bred Sage in Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought, I found this unknown haze
Afghan female, and I didn't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made the crop and then I decided I
wanted to make some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I brought Big Sur seed and that Big Sur
seed was of African lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Chamba.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was this unknown female times
this Chamba Afghan cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did a back cross and made a
few, made some parents and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when some of the first batches of
seeds were sold as, I think it was labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: as Sage times Big Sur Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the story kind of that, that there was
Big Sur Holyweed in Sage, which is true
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's Big Sur Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Big Sur African weed in Sage and
there's haze in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all part of the Big Sur story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all part of the central coast story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all part of the killer weed grown on
the hill story, but there is no lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the main thing, you know,
and then to complicate things further,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, friends, family and friends were
growing under to get out of the fog.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were growing right underneath the
Franciscan monastery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a hermitage, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was another level to the
Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I perpetuated that story by saying
like, yeah, the Holyweed is Holyweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was grown by the hermitage and blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then over time you start hearing the
story about a monk and this monk was in
[SPEAKER_00]: bunk named Perry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was at the Buddhist from the
Buddhist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Buddhist monastery thing in Big
Sur happened years later and it's at a
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally has nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in the Perry thing and the
Zacatecas purple, it's like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was Mexican cannabis because the
majority of the cannabis was Mexican in
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Sur.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the actual story of a guy who sourced
it and found it and preserved it and gave
[SPEAKER_00]: it, that's all just lore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all just made up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's even African things that
it came from a Latunji the drummer and all
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's truth to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Olatunji was a family friend and he would
play in Big Sur, but he didn't bring
[SPEAKER_00]: flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was more of us sharing these
African varieties with them saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at this great Malawi and Tanzanian
stuff we're growing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all these different stories
about the monk named Perry and was he a
[SPEAKER_00]: Franciscan or was he Buddhist and the
African influence from Olatunji.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just the reality is it was just a guy
saying to another guy, you grow really
[SPEAKER_00]: good weed, you know, and it's kind of
like, I think that that's the same for
[SPEAKER_00]: Maui, Waui and Alaska Thunderfuck and
maybe a bunch of other, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Acapulco gold and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, is it, was it a breeding
project where someone created a lineage
[SPEAKER_00]: and does that lineage last today is a big
difference from someone saying this was
[SPEAKER_00]: great, amazing flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you grew this time, you know,
and so it became just a thing and it still
[SPEAKER_00]: is today, you know, and, and I still,
you know, I have a cultivar that I
[SPEAKER_00]: selected out of my Sage and I call it Big
Sur and I caught sometimes I even call it
[SPEAKER_00]: holy weed because it embodies that it has
that, that, that signature that I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: as a kid of that type of cannabis,
it has those genes in there from that
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes influence and from that Chamba
influence and it's amazing, I re-uplifting
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm happy to use, to throw the Big Sur
on there, but you know, there is no one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing called Big Sur holy weed,
you know, and the people who went on to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed with different things, they
legitimately got seeds that were called
[SPEAKER_00]: holy weed and they did come from weed that
was sold as holy weed and some of the guys
[SPEAKER_00]: who have lines today, it's great weed and
it is Mexican descent cannabis from Big
[SPEAKER_00]: Sur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it also deserves the credit of being
called holy weed today, but the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: story of a guy and how it happened,
it's, that's just a, it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as I know that there's no,
no validity to it and I can't find one
[SPEAKER_00]: single person that can corroborate any of
the, you know, the folklore online,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas the other stuff I just grew,
like these were Big Sur holy weed was a
[SPEAKER_00]: name from like back to, you know,
my earliest memories of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that came along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was never like something that I
discovered or learned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just part of your life,
you know, and it was never, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything other than it just being great
cannabis from Big Sur, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but of a certain lineage, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of a certain class, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of a certain type, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's important thing back to
the land race thing and what we wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very specific thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't come up with an OG from,
from, sorry, not picking an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one of those things just that
it's a great go-to, but you can't pick an
[SPEAKER_00]: OG and grow it in Big Sur and call it holy
weed, you know, just cause it was grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's not just cannabis from Big Sur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, but it, it is a certain,
you know, chemical class, you could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's, there's the,
the, the online stories are way cooler
[SPEAKER_00]: than just, you know, the reality is
usually much simpler.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that often the case?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, look, that's, that's so interesting
to hear that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I'd love to ask, given that you do
see people referencing it sometimes in
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding work, and given that it is
something that's not very well represented
[SPEAKER_03]: in people's minds, just for anyone
wondering, including myself, how would,
[SPEAKER_03]: how would you describe, I know that it's a
broad thing, the holy weed, but the one
[SPEAKER_03]: that you sort of envision in your mind,
how would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it, is it like a plant that looks like
a haze plant and smells like a haze plant
[SPEAKER_03]: to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it, do you think the Mexicans were
similar to the ones that were used in haze
[SPEAKER_03]: or they were a bit different and it wasn't
quite as racy?
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you sort of just describe
smoking it, the smell and the effects for
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone who hasn't tried it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, to be honest, like then I'd
have to really think that if there,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there was ever a holy weed,
so like it's a spectrum, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a spectrum of these, like I can tell
you the first time I grew what someone
[SPEAKER_00]: else was, was someone gave me in 94 seeds
of Big Sur holy weed, a friend from Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: Cruz, and I grew it out and it looked
exactly like what I remember cannabis from
[SPEAKER_00]: the 70s being.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was big, giant, green, Mexican,
red hair, sativa plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just mediocre high though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe I didn't, maybe I didn't
select the right seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I only grew it out of a few
seeds, but it was classic Mexican,
[SPEAKER_00]: California weed, just big giant,
you know, Christmas tree structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, I mean, that's why,
like, when I say like haze embodies that
[SPEAKER_00]: in modern cannabis and a lot of,
and that's, and like to the breeding work
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been done, I fully believe that the
seed producers today who have Big Sur holy
[SPEAKER_00]: weed in their lineage got it from people
who got seeds out of flour from those
[SPEAKER_00]: original things that were called holy
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember it's the original things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a hundred plants in one bag and
next year there are a hundred different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and next year there are a hundred
different plants and next year there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you bought Big Sur holy weed from
70s, three to 78 or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was never one thing, even if you bought
it from just from that one producer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause for one, nobody breeding,
breeding, you know, from segregating males
[SPEAKER_00]: is really difficult, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so like people who were, and when I
was a kid, nobody called themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just produced seed for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone was constantly producing seed
for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there wasn't, you know, I'm just
saying it wasn't what people assume it is
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have isolation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have any of those things to
create lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't, you know, David Watson
wasn't producing holy weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there wasn't like a concerted breeding
effort over five years to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why, when I came to Amsterdam
and I had been smoking hazes and Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: light crosses and all these stuff and
skunk ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I did this seed batch in my
backyard, in my courtyard, and I had the
[SPEAKER_00]: one little plant in the corner that was
literally four inches tall, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had less than a gram of flour on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I went down and gave it a little sniff
and it was just like instant, like time
[SPEAKER_00]: portal to my childhood of that,
that aroma, that profile, that Big Sur
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't to me, it wasn't being,
I didn't want to, I didn't call it Big Sur
[SPEAKER_00]: holy weed even in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, it was just the smell of my
childhood of cannabis from my childhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a instant marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I knew I was like,
whatever is in this plant, that's what I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I want it to be for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it was just a matter of,
you know, finding some other plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: cross it with in order to reach seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that original female, that unknown
female had it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I assume it was haze that was
contributing to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I say like, you know,
haze embodies that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so does Malawi and so does a lot of
other things that are out there that I
[SPEAKER_00]: still encounter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I love the African haze
from ace seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It rocks my boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I smell it and I get in there,
I'm just like, that is the smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: the look, everything of what I remember
cannabis to be as a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, you know, so that's in as much as
I'd love for there to be like a stronger,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone came out of the woodworks and
said, Hey, yeah, I've got some seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: I got from Patrick Cassidy's 1974 harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and that's what my Big Sur
holy weed is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then yes, you could just call that Big Sur
holy weed and just be just say it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but the reality is, is what do
you look of where and how many people sold
[SPEAKER_00]: flower at a Big Sur as holy weed for how
long and what the possible lineages could
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everything, you know, and,
you know, so that's, that's just as what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but the few things that the few
things that survived, like Dolores,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican variety and Chamba, the African
variety, those things were selected and
[SPEAKER_00]: developed and kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kept somewhat isolated and they did
have that Big Sur holy, that time capsule
[SPEAKER_00]: thing from that period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those lines were worked in used in
modern cannabis today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's, you know, contributes
to the sage that I grew and the breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: work I do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still every selection I make is
towards that original profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though I've crossed sage with
Chamba, I've crossed sage with OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've crossed it with sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've crossed it with Asian fantasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've crossed it with a bunch of different
things that are all over the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that I'm selecting for,
just cause I want to stay in my lane,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause you know, Turpinoline is my jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that, you know, the uplifting
effect is I'm selecting for that first
[SPEAKER_00]: sniff that I had in the corner in the
courtyard in Amsterdam in 1994,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was just like, Oh my God,
that's the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want cannabis to be for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that some people might enjoy
it as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that as a big fan of Turpinoline
myself, I'm all about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to quickly ask before we moved
on, because we had a few people ask this
[SPEAKER_03]: one on the Patreon while we're talking
about the Big Sur holy weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They saw that episode of where you showed
up to Jim Belushi's cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: People wanted to know, did you end up
giving him some Big Sur holy weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any chance they might be able to
get it through his brand at one point?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as a follow-up, you mentioned it
earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I made a note to loop back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said, Oh, there's a different story
about the progression towards Sansemilla.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to hear that in the area.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that like transitioning from
seeded to seedless and how did that change
[SPEAKER_03]: the game?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I did the episode with Jim Belushi,
which was a total blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a fantastic time and I loved
working with Jim and all his team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually really appreciate what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really kind of rare in cannabis in
that they do see a big value in genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: and unique profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that they kind of want to
differentiate themselves as a brand around
[SPEAKER_00]: that, which is pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really went out on a limb with the
Colombian stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was really what motivated
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my working on that episode with them
was that these guys are for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want better weed in their brand and
they also want to tell the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, so I told the story on the
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long story and it's how TV goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things get edited down, but I tried to
just kind of distill it down to the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you that it's not just one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of more a class or a religion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I'm very much working on getting
that into Belushi Farms for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm super passionate about people
getting access to what at least some
[SPEAKER_00]: people think is really world-class
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that even if it's in small
batches, people should have the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I'm working towards getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long journey with me,
with Sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been dancing together for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I keep a catalog alive and I do
continue to do some breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we're going to see,
just like we're having this conversation,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having this conversation more often
that we're going to see brands and the
[SPEAKER_00]: market and the consumer slowly starting to
ask for different options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to try and make that
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was the other half?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Sinsemea, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sinsemea was a book written in... I
should grab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me grab a copy off the shelf so I
don't butcher this really quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sinsemea, Marijuana Flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a book by...
[SPEAKER_00]: Richardson and Woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a hard time with the names because
they're not real names.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're aliases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photography by Eric Woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Flowers by Jim Richardson.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time that I'm aware of and
others have agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first time that the tech on
pulling mails was widely disseminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people didn't know how to make
seedless cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, people had grown plenty of
seedless cannabis just because the law of
[SPEAKER_00]: averages, you flip a coin, you're likely
to get a heads pretty often or tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plenty of people, I'm sure just had a
female in the backyard and grew and smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: seedless weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know it goes back far into the
literature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've known how to make seedless cannabis
for a while, but in modern world,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't something that was widely known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even most of the import Sinsemea that
people brought in usually had some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the story I was told was in 1974 or
so, a batch of Thai weed entered into Big
[SPEAKER_00]: Sur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people who purchased it were like
totally blown away at how seedless it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they through the importer contacted
the growers and the growers basically told
[SPEAKER_00]: them the easy, pull them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple, simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure why the word Sinsemea was
already known and why there's not a Thai
[SPEAKER_00]: word in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as I know, that's where the
authors got the idea was from Thai flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, they've been smoking
Sinsemea and in the market, I guess that
[SPEAKER_00]: word was heavily used already for seedless
or less seedless flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as they knew how to do it,
they did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The forward is from David Crosby actually
of Crosby, Stills and Ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anyway, this was the first time
that they really spread the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the far out part is when they learned
about it, they knew right away like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, we need to grow a crop and photograph
the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then write a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like they were doing it and then
they just documented it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they literally did, they grew
this crop for the purpose of photographing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, for the purpose of writing this book,
for the purpose of sharing the concept of
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling mails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as I know from all the old Cali
growers and stuff that I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is where they learned how to make
Sinsemea was from this one book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some family friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that was an interesting little,
and I just learned this just recently a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years ago that it was Thai
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never knew, I always assumed it was just
Mexican flower that they had contacted
[SPEAKER_00]: someone in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's other stories for how
other people had shared the knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as I know, this book was the
first time and Rob and David also and Mel
[SPEAKER_00]: Frank and all these guys, they all agree
this was the first time that was widely
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, how did it change the
landscape?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for example, was there an immediate
realization that the value of the crop had
[SPEAKER_03]: gone up significantly, or was there like a
year or two of delay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm assuming when you gave that
story, I see it in my mind perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone just has one plant in the
backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a female.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're sitting around with their mates
and they're like, wow, it was really good
[SPEAKER_03]: this year, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like not exactly sure why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the same thing when they pulled
them out?
[SPEAKER_03]: It took a minute before they were like,
hey, we actually got something here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like, how did that go?
[SPEAKER_03]: And was there any other unexpected
repercussions or flow on effects?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to go and get back and do some
research in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if from what I heard, it was around 74
and this book was published in 76.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they grew the crop in 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, by 75, people were
growing a lot of cannabis and Big Sur all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was just seeded weed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from what I gather, it happened right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just like the internet
turning on or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once people realized, oh no, this is a
male, pull your males, it became pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, people aren't always going to
be successful in doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to leave males that they
didn't know were there, get pollinated by
[SPEAKER_00]: their neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I think it was pretty widely
adapted and not just by the locals and Big
[SPEAKER_00]: Sur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's spread around the world and
everybody quickly realized like,
[SPEAKER_00]: duh, oh my God, is that easy?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just pull the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I'm sure the next big thing was
like, oh my God, I've got to pull half of
[SPEAKER_00]: my crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to plant half a crop and then kill
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't really think about it that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, that was a big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that it's interesting though,
but that happened right around the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time that camp started ramping up and Big
Sur got hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually in 1977, there was an article
in LA Times about the harvest parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was full colored pictures in the
newspaper like, hey, these hippies are
[SPEAKER_00]: just like growing weed up here and having
a big party.
[SPEAKER_00]: So camp got really heavy and they started
busting people and ripping plants out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ground right at that same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right when everyone was kind of like
learning how to grow cannabis and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: better seed and making their own crosses
and establishing their own little
[SPEAKER_00]: production, they had to go and run deep,
deep, deep into the hills, into this new
[SPEAKER_00]: model of gorilla growing, which is like,
was all about growing and not,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was no more, it wasn't about botany and
horticulture anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about not getting busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that was it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, it was like my first memories of
seeing plants, like in a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: production, I don't like, to me,
it looked like a field, but I'm sure it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't that big, but it was definitely
rows of cannabis, like grown in a patch,
[SPEAKER_00]: like all in one place in like the mid late
seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then by the just a few years later,
you never saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just saw a plant here and a plant
there and a plant here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just scattered around on the
hillside with this, you know, all this
[SPEAKER_00]: drip line connecting everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just the whole idea of just kind of
growing cannabis where you could kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to it like a gardener or tend to it
like a farmer, have it next to your home,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, next to your vegetable garden,
for instance, that was all gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it quickly became you know,
growing cannabis was about dressing up in
[SPEAKER_00]: camos and going out in the middle of the
night and carrying chicken wire and drip
[SPEAKER_00]: line way, way, way out into the,
into the backwoods in order to not get
[SPEAKER_00]: busted, which you can imagine,
like that changes everything in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: like what the plant needs to be and how to
grow the plant and what type of plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just everything changed, you know,
that's where I can't get over like this
[SPEAKER_00]: whole how much prohibition shaped not just
the gene pool, but what we consider to be
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, what we want from cannabis,
you know, how we interface and engage
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just either an artifact of
prohibition or blowback from prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to understate the impact it's
had, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask what like you obviously
grew up so heavily surrounded by all of
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the stimulus for you to think,
I need, I need to head to Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it all of this prohibition around you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming you were probably near at the
end of high school when you started
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking about going to Amsterdam,
what was that transition like from being a
[SPEAKER_03]: kid surrounded by it in California to
thinking I got to go to Europe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cannabis in California had gotten
really crazy in the eighties because of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the zero tolerance laws and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it became less fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like just there was the stress
around it was pretty, pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, my childhood friend,
Adam Dunn had moved to Amsterdam and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he would send me postcards and
we would chat and he'd come and visit me
[SPEAKER_00]: from time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was always just like, come on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was always kind of like,
yeah, you know, I'm I'm thinking about it
[SPEAKER_00]: one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also had a family friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad was a musician and back in Big Sur
had a band and they're called Big Sur
[SPEAKER_00]: Light and Power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guitar player was Al Shackman,
who was also Nina Simone's lifetime guitar
[SPEAKER_00]: player.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Al was living in Paris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had met up with Al in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: and he basically said, come on out to
Paris and all.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was outside of Paris somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, come on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, I'll be your mentor and I'll
teach you jazz guitar and you can come and
[SPEAKER_00]: stay with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Adam was saying, come to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Al was saying, come to France.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of wavering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day I just came home and
someone stole my truck with all my tools
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working as a doing carpentry and
stuff at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second I saw and I saw the truck
driving away and just like just like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lightning flash and like, boom,
Amsterdam, I'm gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a and I was 23 at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a one way ticket and I told my
friends and family, I said, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be gone for probably a month, no more,
no more than a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up staying for six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I came to Amsterdam just to
hang out and see the scene, to see what it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, which was wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just Queen's Day, you know, oh,
my God, just the things, the fun we had,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all the all the old squat
parties and, and, you know, just Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: in the early nineties was just a blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a really good time there for a
few months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went and hitchhiked down to
Paris in your classic, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: American on the road thing with the
backpack and a guitar and a big giant bag
[SPEAKER_00]: and Nepalese hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I basically was like,
all I need is a bunch of hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: my guitar and a backpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I showed up in Paris and I had been
computing, I had been communicating with
[SPEAKER_00]: Al via postcard and phone cards,
you know, because we didn't have cell
[SPEAKER_00]: phones in those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, most flats didn't have
phones even that my friends had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd like get a phone card and call
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I show up in Paris and Al had moved
back to the US somewhat abruptly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just kind of stranded in Paris
with like no money and my guitar and a
[SPEAKER_00]: backpack and just like kind of like,
hmm, what should I do now?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I really came here to do music
and I just kind of contacted Adam and
[SPEAKER_00]: decided I had a metagirl who was working
at sensei seeds at the time, Monica,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I called her up and she's like,
why don't you come up here and just hang
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we became a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within a few months, I started growing
cannabis indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a few months later, I started
plot popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few months later, I built up another
little grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was just, I settled in
and I decided I was never coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I loved Amsterdam so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided I would live there for the rest
of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was found sage, which was fun because
it was something new and all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cannabis cup stuff was going on
and the culture was kind of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was kind of a buzz in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was this epicenter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Adam was well connected and knew
people and started his hemp clothing
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a really exciting time to be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then prop 215 happened and California,
you know, made this big shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started thinking about why I was in
Amsterdam and, you know, kind of missing
[SPEAKER_00]: family and missing geography, missing the
mountains and the coast and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And decided to come back and try my hand
at, you know, doing what I was doing in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam and California, which is kind of
what brought me back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought seeds, brought sage seeds
back and continued to breed and just kept
[SPEAKER_00]: moving forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me quickly ask one question before we
continue on, which is what was the
[SPEAKER_03]: creation of sage like?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, can you take us through the
steps of, was it planned?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it just like a happy accident?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the case that you pop one of the
parents and then thought, Oh, I've got to
[SPEAKER_03]: work with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how did it sort of go down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was after growing indoors for a
couple of cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, coming from, being a
California boy, I wanted to grow outside
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wanted to grow from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically accumulated a bunch of seed
from random places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all, nothing purchased,
never, not a single, I've never bought a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed in my entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are seeds that were gifted to me,
seeds that fell out of a joint that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a few of them that were
unlabeled, but segregated, meaning like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like, if something was special,
I'd wrap it up in like a little rolling
[SPEAKER_00]: paper or something to designate it from
just being another seed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I planted in the backyard of a
hundred or so seeds and in the corner,
[SPEAKER_00]: I planted in pots instead of the ground,
a few of these, I think this might be
[SPEAKER_00]: special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of those seeds didn't grow very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just sitting in the corner and too
big of a pot, probably germinated late and
[SPEAKER_00]: was just struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the one that I smelled and
had the flower that that smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, right away, luckily I'd already,
you know, I'd been kind of diving in big
[SPEAKER_00]: into learning about how to grow and got
all the grow books I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd already met Rob and all these
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I knew about re-vegging plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I plucked off enough flower off that
one little plant in order to dry it and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right away it was just like,
holy shit, this is really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: By far the best thing out of the whole
backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started to re-veg it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It slowly, slowly crawled out of flower
and re-veged and grew out the mom,
[SPEAKER_00]: made some cuts and did it indoor around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest is history.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, didn't have a name for it at
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sold it, I think, at the first time I
sold it, I sold it as Maui Mist,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, because the gray area had just
opened up the coffee shop and they wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell some, but we didn't have a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was similar to a haze or a Cali
Mist or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we called it Maui Mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it had that sage smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, that not only reminded me of
this flower from Big Sur, but it also
[SPEAKER_00]: reminded me of Big Sur itself,
the sage brush kind of chaparral smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is terpenaline as in salvia,
the sage plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one night I just kind of had this
epiphany and I'd been reading and meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob and meeting and learning about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really liked the Afghanica as
opposed to Indica, because I was always
[SPEAKER_00]: puzzled as a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember seeing products in grocery
stores called Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like Indica rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would say right on the label,
Indica rice is a type of rice grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: India, just explaining what Indica meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always thought it was kind of
puzzling that all these plants from
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan were called Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once just smelling sage and having the
sagey smell that me and Adam were talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, like, oh, it's got the sagey smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought of the acronym,
Sativa Afghanica genetic equilibrium,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it had a strong sativa effect,
but it was chunky and it came in under 70
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it had the Afghani influence on the
agronomic side, but it had the sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: influence on the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I had a female that was growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that point, TH seeds was already in
business and just the idea was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, we should turn this into a seed
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used the Chamba Afghan cross and
found a male from that and found a sage
[SPEAKER_00]: times Chamba female and a sage times
Chamba male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe I back crossed that male
against the sage female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, I found, I believe is
where the sage male and the sage female
[SPEAKER_00]: came that would eventually be used to make
the seeds for sage, for TH seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it's 12 and a half percent
Chamba, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have the lineage somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I could figure it out,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like a sage BX1F2 almost by
the sounds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, gosh, look, it's a very
popular strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people know about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you know the numbers and
I'm not exactly looking for them,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like, would you say that it was
certainly commercially successful or was
[SPEAKER_03]: it just a strain that people happen to
know a lot about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I was growing it in
Amsterdam, it created a buzz because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was something new and it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people wanted to smoke it and
there was definitely a hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was people trying to buy
cuts and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of people who bought seeds
were able to find really special
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of diversity in there,
as you could tell just by looking at that
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot to sort through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a homozygous line at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that sorting, there's a lot of
really magical stuff that is all still
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of in that one spectrum of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sage class, that turpentine kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Little Pockets, people found it and it
was really different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a great breeding tool because
it had this kind of soaring effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had more luck with the crosses I
made with it than just the pure sage,
[SPEAKER_00]: just because, and I think you could say
the same maybe for TH seeds like sage and
[SPEAKER_00]: sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that brought both of those worlds
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some other sage sour crosses from
other people that were really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used OG quite a bit in crossing with
sage, but always selected for sage traits
[SPEAKER_00]: on the effect side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a really good breeding parent to
bring some of that hazy sativa side into
[SPEAKER_00]: your hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you started to see a lot of
these, the foco sage and I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: think of what is the other one that's kind
of popular that was going around the guys
[SPEAKER_00]: have a rename.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can't remember, but there's a
number, there's things, and I've run into
[SPEAKER_00]: people all the time who tell me there's
things in their lawn that sage is in,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I know green Bodhi, a lot of his
stuff has sage in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know all the sour best shit ever,
SBSC that has sage in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it became a part of things more than it
became something on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that kind of also speaks just
to the need agronomically to create
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really hard to stay in the later
flowering world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, sage and haze and Jack and
Durbin and train wreck and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: things, they're all in this kind of
trapezoid class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them work better for growers
in some ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they've all been mixed up by the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely train wreck out there
that is sage, and that's happened a few
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens just like there's
Durbin's out there that aren't Durbin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's Jack's that are Durbin and
Durbin's that are Jack's and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that terpenolene signature kind of
became a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know people who've used it to breed
into their other terpenolene dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: lines just because it brings, I think the
one big attribute that sage had in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of what it offered that haze didn't was it
was earlier flowering and chunkier,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still had that same storing effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like the way you said, you know,
it's sort of it's worked its way into many
[SPEAKER_03]: things more than being its own thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's sort of all you can really
hope for as a breeder, really,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because nothing's going to stay around
forever unless you made OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's face it, we're not all going to
be so lucky.
