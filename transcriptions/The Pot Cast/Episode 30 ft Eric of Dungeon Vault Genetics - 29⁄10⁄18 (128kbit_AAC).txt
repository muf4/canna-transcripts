[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah On this episode we have dungeon vault
genetics Big fan of this guy been trying
[SPEAKER_03]: it for a long time really excited for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's jump into it guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go Alrighty so a big thank you and
welcome to the man behind all the Insane
[SPEAKER_03]: grandpa breath crosses you've undoubtedly

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to Eric of dungeon vault
genetics for joining us Thanks,
[SPEAKER_01]: man for having me No worries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first question I gotta ask you I
feel like it's almost like obligatory at
[SPEAKER_03]: this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about granddaddy purple?
[SPEAKER_01]: The strain yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a it's it's a good strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like Classic I'm from California
originally so from the time that I first
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered some really good Perps till now
even you all have that we have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion We call it you just call it the
perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have that it's got that that purple
smell whatever but The cut of kin's GDP
[SPEAKER_01]: that I bred with and the one that I'm so
familiar with A lot of people say came
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Urkel family and if that's the
case then it seems like I might need to
[SPEAKER_01]: dig more into the purple Urkel lines
because it's got that it's it's very it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just a great plant in general,
I think the for medicinal values and
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding wise everything it's just it's a
it's perfect And how do you feel about
[SPEAKER_03]: the?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes comparison made that it's kind
of like a cash cropper version of Urkel Do
[SPEAKER_03]: you see that per se and do you do you find
that to be a negative thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at this point Honestly in the
circles that I see and the people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: running stuff It almost seems like the
purples like just straight purples Whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it be Urkel granddaddy some of those are
not I don't seem getting pumped out as
[SPEAKER_01]: much it seems like it's kind of Moved on
to the hype circles, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a lot more of these, you know Newer
stuff that's come out but there are
[SPEAKER_01]: certain breeders who I see working with
that stuff and they're absolutely Killing
[SPEAKER_01]: it and everyone's loving their gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing that there's obviously some
good things going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine that The Urkel I don't know I I
guess I haven't had As much experience
[SPEAKER_01]: with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I I've only seen it when I live down in
California it's been a while since since
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been up in Washington that I've seen
that but Yeah for sure and I guess this is
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe just a more personal question I was
wondering do you find that Mendo perps and
[SPEAKER_01]: GDP get confused or I Think I think many
strains get confused a lot But yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely the perps just like I said
earlier anything that's got perp or has
[SPEAKER_01]: that smell someone immediately goes Oh,
it's that Mendo perp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's this or that but there's so Many
varieties that that all have very similar
[SPEAKER_01]: smells and or it could be, you know cross
breeds with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Who's to really know some guys out
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You open a bag, you know exactly what your
smell and you've been familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've smoked you've grown you've seen it
To me Mendo perps I think is completely
[SPEAKER_01]: different than say GDP and some of these
other ones I used to get Mendo perp so it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a lot more of a darker I almost want
to say sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a little while, but I will say
they're different in my opinion Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So fast forward to now.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you currently smoking on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just got done smoking some
platinum Girl Scout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm still smoking cookies Hey,
it's good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things like just like a
good OG or really anything I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: connoisseur so I'm staring at my Jars
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some dr. Gonzo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got brandy wine citrus farmer I got
the cookies Kind of a kind of a mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: array of things, but I do like smoking my
strains when I go every time I go to a cup
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always running into people who have
grown my strains and they come by and
[SPEAKER_01]: shoot me a jar or something and that's
always really cool because then I get to
[SPEAKER_01]: go home and smoke it and sample it and
Sometimes it's not a great sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they're extremely well grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of Toss-up and it's really
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm loving anything right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got a good smell and a good flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in general, are you more an indica or
sativa guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely indica or indica hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I don't mind a good sativa I'm trying to
bring more than to my work actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to me on a daily what I'm looking for
I want to know I'm stoned I want to feel
[SPEAKER_01]: that slap across the face or the couch
lock kind of a high so I prefer the indica
[SPEAKER_01]: but Man, it's kind of hard to rival a
really nice smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get the right one and it
definitely puts a smile on your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: So There's there's kind of days,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to smoke a sativa I think but
my my jars are always filled with dense
[SPEAKER_03]: buds That's a good description So let's go
back to the start.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I had a neighbor two doors down from
me who He worked for Disney or he works
[SPEAKER_01]: for Disney now now, excuse me,
but he he He turned me on to weed He had I
[SPEAKER_01]: had shown up to his house and was talking
about wanting to get high and I knew he
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked and he had I had only seen you know
pictures of stuff at that point,
[SPEAKER_01]: but He had some I guess you know green
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of you were smoking the Mexi weed
back when I first started You know
[SPEAKER_01]: compressed swag the straight brown bud
with seeds and stems This guy was the
[SPEAKER_01]: first person to show me some actual You
know killer bud that that looked like what
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw in magazines and the high times and
things back in the day so He he was the
[SPEAKER_01]: first person to get me stoned and that was
that was pretty awesome I mean that to
[SPEAKER_01]: this day I've still sent him messages here
and there said man If you could only see
[SPEAKER_01]: where I'm at now, bro, like it's your
fault He definitely led the he got he
[SPEAKER_01]: sparked the interest so to speak So that
was that was really cool, but I've got um
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's there's a lot of memories,
but I think that that was probably he was
[SPEAKER_01]: probably that the number one influence in
my life for weed and So when did you make
[SPEAKER_03]: the transition from enthusiast to grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well There's a big difference between a
guy who grows or someone who is popping
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds for instance Or anything that matter
and then someone who's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: successfully growing like I've been
popping seeds since I was a little kid I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: throw them over the place in my parents
yard I'd set a little spot in the field
[SPEAKER_01]: and think it was good show all my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd get taken within a month I lost
tons of plants along the way before I
[SPEAKER_01]: realized that okay You're supposed to keep
your mouth shut about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to be a secret You don't
tell nobody so I think when I really got
[SPEAKER_01]: into growing it had my first successful
grow wasn't until probably really close to
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly like 2000 Shoot that had been
like 2003 because I had grown no,
[SPEAKER_01]: excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a little bit before that,
but either way I've been growing a while
[SPEAKER_01]: but nothing to a point where I had it down
I was successfully cropping I was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, look at my work and say damn
look what I've done or You know gain
[SPEAKER_01]: something from it There was too many times
where I was getting all the way to the end
[SPEAKER_01]: and then someone come and rip my plants
and it's cuz I had a big mouth so That's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I say successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's probably probably a good 15 plus
years now that I've been actually at it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but And and what was it that stimulated
you to start creating your own seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it self-sufficiency or you got
interested in being able to offer
[SPEAKER_03]: something?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because when I started you could still
get a good number for your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean people were still selling,
you know I mean $300 ounces so it was very
[SPEAKER_01]: good if you could get into the if you can
get into the industry or in the business
[SPEAKER_01]: and have a medical card or not if you were
just growing and selling weed you were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing okay for yourself, but to me,
I think I've always just been very very
[SPEAKER_01]: Interested in I don't know why but I I
just I just every time I smell pot It was
[SPEAKER_01]: just like a total like my head would spin
in a speak, you know, it's I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're there's this old TV show back in
the day when I was a kid and the guy would
[SPEAKER_01]: smell cheese and his head would spin you
go crazy every time I smelled cheese and I
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of that's that's pretty much how I
was at Weed so I knew something was up
[SPEAKER_01]: with it There was more than I just like I
just enjoy smoke and I was so enthralled
[SPEAKER_01]: with it that I knew there was something
more to it I was really interested in all
[SPEAKER_01]: the different strains and categorizing
things and and I'd look in the excuse me
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd look in the beginning of those I Don't
remember the name of the magazine but
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd have a huge seed catalog and I
would just sit there and highlight all the
[SPEAKER_01]: strains I wanted to get and what I was
wanted to you know see but Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of just took over and I feel like
I feel like the seed thing More or less
[SPEAKER_01]: became a part of me because I wanted to
have My own lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to say hey, I made that There
were certain things I'd look I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: smell and I wasn't smelling and I thought
it would be cool if I could create
[SPEAKER_01]: something that had Certain, you know
flavors that we were after I've always
[SPEAKER_01]: been a skunk fan when I was a kid So
anything that really stunk that's what I
[SPEAKER_01]: was really into and really wanted so I
thought that at some point I'd really like
[SPEAKER_01]: To get into making something that really,
you know, you crack the jar and makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole whole House smell and I'll have
people asking where the weed is at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's been a goal For a long
time, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah, that's a fun memory of so many
guests on the show Something I wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: mention a lot of people probably know you
by your online forum handle for so long I
[SPEAKER_03]: was trying to dig it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to be honest, I ran out of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember it was PNW something.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Originally it was man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that Pacific Northwest grown was
my original hand since 2004 Maybe even
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier because I was I was on overgrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was originally on overgrow I think it
was stoned stupid or something way back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day and then I We all over go got hit
and shut down and everybody jumped to IC
[SPEAKER_01]: mags So I had made sort of made friends
with some of these heads that were
[SPEAKER_01]: actually pretty popular people at their
time and so when we made the switch over
[SPEAKER_01]: to IC mag I switched my name to Pacific
Northwest grown and That in a way kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: started my whole Career in a sense as well
because that's when I really started
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into genetics and I had met a man
by the name of Captain Crip He has done
[SPEAKER_01]: work with DNA genetics and and he has his
own seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't he's kind of behind the shadows
I'm not exactly sure what he's up to
[SPEAKER_01]: nowadays, but he he's I mean he's kind of
taking a step back I'm not sure but he he
[SPEAKER_01]: had some amazing stuff and he and I had
been exchanging stuff for a minute there
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'd we had talked for you for Quite a
while and and he had really I think he
[SPEAKER_01]: actually was another now I mentioned it
was another huge influence in me wanting
[SPEAKER_01]: to make my own seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Yeah, people like that there was a ton
of guys on there that were just real
[SPEAKER_01]: popular heads that that yeah switched over
to IC mag and IC mag was Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the spot if you want to talk
about anything you want to know the latest
[SPEAKER_01]: and greatest On genetics that was your
place to go and then if you had a somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: decent reputation You would be well known
on there enough to where people you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd mess with you They talked to you
and you could make some some decent
[SPEAKER_01]: friends on and offline.
[SPEAKER_03]: So It was kind of cool Yeah, it sounds
like the glory days in a lot of ways Were
[SPEAKER_03]: there any people on there who you kind of
looked up to in regards to breeders or
[SPEAKER_03]: just even people in general?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was it more of like a inward community
type of thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know what there was Buddies we
would be up all night waiting for the
[SPEAKER_01]: auctions, you know, there was those rare
res dog Option or auctions and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these other guys that Dutch grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a female breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think she got busted cuz a res dog
actually Sad to say but uh, there was
[SPEAKER_01]: other people as well that those were those
were the Those are the people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: making big moves back then they had they
had huge Following and before this whole
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram thing that was I mean you look
at the forums and you basically look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the person's little like Karma points how
many how many posts do they have how many
[SPEAKER_01]: how much?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know credit do they have on this site?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you see some of these people senior
members or breeder and whatever and they
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's another thing You couldn't talk
to these people like you do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy nowadays You can just hit up
anybody and everybody and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: they're literally a direct message away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's wild so But yeah, there was You
know res dog Dutch grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned captain Crip.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was there was quite a few other
people as well I mean even I mean DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics all these guys that are big now
that are they were still big back then So,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we everyone wanted those seeds We
were all you know writing down lists of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything we wanted all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was crazy times so I mean it
really wasn't long ago that I was You know
[SPEAKER_01]: spending all my money on seeds not not
really making them So now it's it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit different, but I still spend
all my money on seeds I don't know what's
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong with me You got the the disease we
all got seed yeah seed itis So just for
[SPEAKER_03]: the kind of the next part of the whole
keeping linearity within the storyline How
[SPEAKER_03]: did you then transition to working with
Ken?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was a I was hired on I did a huge
review on Craigslist of all the Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: State dispensaries I had visited and I had
got my medical card.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say in like 2008 or something
like that here in Washington State I
[SPEAKER_01]: started going around to every shop I could
find and just basically Checking out their
[SPEAKER_01]: jars seeing what they had and what I found
was more than I mean I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: exaggerate but I want to say more than 50
more than 50% but I'll just I'll just
[SPEAKER_01]: leave it there to to be fair to the state,
but the half the shops you go into Had
[SPEAKER_01]: mislabeled jars absolute fake,
you know, just garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing that was super heady.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing that was like Oh my god,
look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean few and far between you'd find some
some real stuff But it was it was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: a sad scene up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically I Started reviewing stuff on
on Craigslist and ended up having someone
[SPEAKER_01]: hit me up and says hey Well, we've we are
trying to start a whole new, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: thing up here in Washington State We'd
love to have you on board.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be our budtender.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being a budtender I Ended up getting in
touch with a guy who walks in and says hey
[SPEAKER_01]: man, you seem to know your stuff You know,
I see you're into seeds and you're you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you're strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should meet my friend Ken and Ken
turned out to be Ken Estes and at the time
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a pretty big following for
granddaddy perp.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was still a huge, you know He had a
really good reputation and then going back
[SPEAKER_01]: to the forum days.
[SPEAKER_01]: There used to be a There used to be a
clone list like a top ten or a top,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know genetics to get and Ken's GDP was
always on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what everybody wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it was not it wasn't Jim's it
wasn't Jake's It wasn't John's it wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Ken's GDP was the name So that name
stuck with me since I was younger and so
[SPEAKER_01]: when I hear about this Oh this guy Ken
with GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, you're not talking about
Ken Estes and he was so Next few days or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up meeting Ken And then we sort of
hit it off just based on again the
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge I was dropping and some other
stuff He just was impressed with what I
[SPEAKER_01]: knew and so he said You should come on
board with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to sell seeds up here and we
need someone who can you know Go around
[SPEAKER_01]: and rep the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what started me off with Ken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a seed rep I went around all over
the state all over the country with him
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the different shows and we'd uh,
we you know, I was a Salesman pretty much,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so that's what started it and
then from there it kind of blossomed into
[SPEAKER_01]: other things I was involved with you know,
everything that they were doing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: company, but then there was a huge kind of
a falling out of him and his employees and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's what ended up giving me the
position to turn breeder for him and so I
[SPEAKER_03]: took on that and Here we are today So
basically I think a lot of people would be
[SPEAKER_03]: aware that you know, Ken has some physical
disabilities But maybe they weren't fully
[SPEAKER_03]: aware that if they had bought some seeds
from Ken during that time period The
[SPEAKER_03]: reality was you made those seeds,
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that and you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something that had come up in the
past You know many people had said hey you
[SPEAKER_01]: you did this you did that as far as you
know Stealing or ripping something off but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's it's not the case when when I
was the one who was the breeder behind the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and everything that was Like I said
after they had their split and I was given
[SPEAKER_01]: the position there are certain Certain
things I'm supposed to be doing for the
[SPEAKER_01]: company and one was breeding and so I'm
Making my seeds for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing everything under the Sun as far
as repping the company Making the sales
[SPEAKER_01]: happen talking to people online doing all
that paying to go to these shows and
[SPEAKER_01]: selling them packaging everything that was
all me So yeah, there's there is a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of confusion that lies within there
and that was also the hugest part about
[SPEAKER_01]: After even leaving the company was was
having the issues with everyone trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: say well Did you make those or was that
Ken stuff and you know, and it was very
[SPEAKER_01]: very confusing so Not not necessarily the
best thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, anybody that bought during the
time that It was There was I think 11
[SPEAKER_01]: strains made during that period around
around 2011 or 2012 to 2014 somewhere in
[SPEAKER_03]: there So with that thought in mind when
you decided to start dungeon vaults and
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of do your own thing Did you
intentionally think to yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna Use a new mail kind of fresh
start thing or did it just work out that
[SPEAKER_03]: way?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what I was thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was I still had and This goes
back to your previous question as well I
[SPEAKER_01]: still had stock left over from the
granddaddy days and so kind of to get my
[SPEAKER_01]: jumpstart and kind of get Just to get my
brand out there because I didn't have my
[SPEAKER_01]: other mail selected yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't it were Maybe I did at the time,
but it wasn't ready one way or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't ready to really seeds a new line
yet under dungeons vault, but I did still
[SPEAKER_01]: have some My originals from granddaddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I still had the funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the grand og purple champagne and
There was I think another one the candy
[SPEAKER_01]: land but Some of these strains they were
they were getting close to selling out So
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point I knew that I it was time to
you know Get a fresh start and all that so
[SPEAKER_01]: I had already been talking to I had told
Ken my idea the whole time You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I said hey, I've got this idea for
grandpa's breath, you know, everything was
[SPEAKER_01]: you know related to GDP or grandpa or
anything like that All kind of fit in with
[SPEAKER_01]: the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had already thought of grandpa's
breath and kind of stuck So that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where this whole new line came from
and it's unfortunate We aren't working
[SPEAKER_01]: together because had we been this could
have been taken to who knows what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: levels with the with the You know
warehouses and the capabilities we had
[SPEAKER_01]: down in, California So but yeah grandpa's
breath was created in Washington State.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I was behind that I did it all so it was
kind of cool to be able to say that once I
[SPEAKER_01]: broke away and was able to start over that
I had as much success with with What I did
[SPEAKER_01]: even though it did take a little while for
people to pick up on me and really give me
[SPEAKER_01]: the shot a lot of people were still a
little bit salty toward the situation
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't really know where to or what to
think about everything so it was a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit hard to You know get my start but once
people started growing everything and they
[SPEAKER_01]: saw what I had to offer I think people
were a little bit more accepting Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's certainly good to see that people
have you know giving you that chance and
[SPEAKER_03]: the person the pudding to say the least
Something I did want to mention because I
[SPEAKER_03]: think you fall into a small category of
breeders who whether it was intentional or
[SPEAKER_03]: not I'm not sure I don't think you're a
fortune teller per se but I think you
[SPEAKER_03]: gauge and Archive, you know, you probably
know where this question is going You all
[SPEAKER_03]: fell into that boat where you kind of
managed to incorporate the OG KB into your
[SPEAKER_03]: work right as it was taking off Was this
something you were aware of or did it just
[SPEAKER_03]: work out that way and you're like man I'm
happy to ride that wave or like How do you
[SPEAKER_03]: feel about it all?
[SPEAKER_01]: That it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was I like I said, I've always been
a connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been very well You know in tune with
all the strains going around When I first
[SPEAKER_01]: got into the cookie scene and I and I
first got my clone the first cut of
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies I got was fake as shit like I knew
right away I was like this is not the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that I'm smoking or that all the
people are talking about So I got the one
[SPEAKER_01]: grew it wasn't it I knew right away then
this whole you know There was like a
[SPEAKER_01]: release all of a sudden like somebody got
it and then they were they were angry at
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that they had to pay so much or
the fact that So many people were hoarding
[SPEAKER_01]: to cut and it all of a sudden started to
spread like wildfire I was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: first people I mean honestly, I hadn't
seen cookies anywhere No one had even
[SPEAKER_01]: heard of it and I brought I finally got it
and brought it up to to Washington and
[SPEAKER_01]: started showing people and that's when
this this whole thing just blew up like
[SPEAKER_01]: every it was already huge in California
and then I'm up here with it and I knew
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know Just having any cookies was
good, but there was the one the OG KB cut
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the one that was kind of you
know, so really held back It wasn't being
[SPEAKER_01]: passed around very much if you knew the
right people you got it If not,
[SPEAKER_01]: good luck and I guess I just I mean it's a
blessing That's all I can say is the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that the guy that gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows who he is I'm not gonna mention
names, but he knows What he did for me and
[SPEAKER_01]: I owe him a lot for it, you know,
eventually I think we will square up at
[SPEAKER_01]: something but it was never a hey you owe
Me this you owe me that or I want this
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave it to me on just good principle He
knew me well enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: He trusted me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He liked me I guess and he wanted to see
me shine and that's got to what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think at the time I Yeah,
like you said gauge green archive me very
[SPEAKER_01]: few people had it and I was right there in
line with them and did we did our releases
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much one after another and I think
from there on out it kind of got even more
[SPEAKER_01]: spread out but you know, man, I I still
see so many people Grow an OG KB.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not OG KB.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's they they got sold a cut If
anything has even remotely Puffy leaves or
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of that that little mutant look
someone will refer to it as an OG KB Or an
[SPEAKER_01]: OG KB fino when in all reality,
that's not what it is really I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just that's there's been so many You
know cuts that that come out like that
[SPEAKER_01]: anything with cookie lineage has a chance
of having that mutated You know kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: funky look and they're really Not I mean
that's not necessarily sought after but OG
[SPEAKER_01]: KB just happened to be the one that that
one When you get it dialed in and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it correctly it yields good It tastes
better than anything and it literally has
[SPEAKER_01]: the craziest smell of all the cookies It's
just it's just one of the better ones in
[SPEAKER_01]: my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said real I was lucky that's
that's all it is I was really lucky and I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like me having that early start
Really kind of helped but many people
[SPEAKER_01]: thought that grandpa's breath had Mendo
breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thought I took gauge green Mendo
breath or one of their things and crossed
[SPEAKER_01]: into it when all reality is no I had the
original cut crossed it to the Tahoe GDP
[SPEAKER_03]: male and BAM, so Yeah, so I mean first
thing I want to say is what the hell's up
[SPEAKER_03]: with like the seeds, you know There's like
a curse on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like no one can really get them to
germinate easy Do you think it just makes
[SPEAKER_03]: the mum kind of unviable as like a
commercial release plan?
[SPEAKER_01]: This the seeds of OG KB, yeah I think that
there that's why I didn't release the the
[SPEAKER_01]: f1s of grandpa's breath It was it was so
tough to crack those suckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like there's I'm not gonna I'll
never hear the end of it If I was
[SPEAKER_01]: releasing, you know And if you get if you
get such poor germination that you replace
[SPEAKER_01]: in every pack you've sold you just screwed
yourself So I knew right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, let's not do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have twos I released I seem to
have pretty good luck with poppin seeds I
[SPEAKER_01]: think a lot of people really make it
harder on themselves and they need To and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still a question I get asked every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you pop your seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you got a guy that's I wish I knew
his name so I could shout him out but he's
[SPEAKER_01]: he's made this little seed cracker tool
and I'm sure that's been around before but
[SPEAKER_01]: This little seed cracker seems like it
could help a lot of people out you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you get through that tough shell gives it
the spot or gives it the chance to pop its
[SPEAKER_01]: little tail out and You know maybe help
someone who's who is having some
[SPEAKER_01]: germination issues With some older seed
stock, but I'd say yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely something to that with
the ogkb I don't know what it is But maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: it maybe it maybe it provides an extra
thick shell or something that just makes a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit harder But I don't know what
everyone else's experiences with all their
[SPEAKER_01]: with all the other companies that are
Selling these crosses, but I know I know
[SPEAKER_01]: with mine There's there's been some issues
here and there but you mean I've gotten so
[SPEAKER_01]: much good feedback that the little bit of
hey I had issues here and there it's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of outweighed By the good so I always try
and make everyone happy and take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: whoever I can but for the most part It's
kind of a mute point with me almost Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: no definitely I believe that um the f1s of
the other companies similarly had some
[SPEAKER_03]: issues with germination Kind of just to
also touch on that point You hammered that
[SPEAKER_03]: point home so perfectly in regards to
people mistaking that cookie look for ogkb
[SPEAKER_03]: in general because I find any cookie cross
can potentially yield that result and our
[SPEAKER_03]: buddy CSI Humboldt He even made the
reference that just from Urkel s ones you
[SPEAKER_03]: can get that exact phenotype So,
you know interesting note to take but
[SPEAKER_03]: also, you know hints something maybe
deeper about the connection between Urkel
[SPEAKER_01]: and cookies Yeah There could be I mean
it's it's they the whole claim is this
[SPEAKER_01]: this cookies came from An f1 Durban and I
don't mean f1 like f1 generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposedly f1 is a strain altogether
cross to Durban hit with With Whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: else and you get and you get the cookies
or whatever and it's like I don't see how
[SPEAKER_01]: there's any Durban in there whatsoever
Maybe I'm wrong, but I think I think
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot more to it with maybe just a
solid purple getting crossed or something
[SPEAKER_01]: else, but I would I would almost want to
know if there's if Possibly what happened
[SPEAKER_01]: was that cherry pie that got big before
cookies, which we all know herms out Maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: touched the og which everyone in
California was already growing rooms of
[SPEAKER_01]: and then that would kind of make sense Why
you get that really tight?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookie structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an og almost and then it's kind
of smaller buds and you get a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of the perp it could have easily been a
Cherry pie times an og, but I have no idea
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't I think there's there's so
many different You know possibilities and
[SPEAKER_01]: and those that that were there when that
happened would be the only ones that know
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll take that to their grave because
I've heard way too many stories and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really know which one I believe but
I think when it all comes down to it's
[SPEAKER_01]: some good pot and if if Fables are going
to go along with cannabis then that's
[SPEAKER_01]: fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just creates more of something to talk
about when we're all high, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely So what traits do you
like to look for when selecting a male and
[SPEAKER_03]: if We kind of give it a kind of some more
detail to the question I guess when you
[SPEAKER_03]: were selecting, you know, your grandpa's
breath male Were you looking for a balance
[SPEAKER_03]: of things or were you just looking for all
one side?
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd you go about that process?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I popped when I popped all those
those grandpa's breath seeds So I could
[SPEAKER_01]: actually know it's a step back because I
was looking for the Tahoe GDP male to make
[SPEAKER_01]: the grandpa's breath so that Man,
you know and that's a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I believe If I can remember that male
correctly, it was it was kind of a short
[SPEAKER_01]: and stacked Male I nowadays I do things a
little bit differently but that was when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was back back then that was that was it
was kind of like a trial and error what
[SPEAKER_01]: happened was I found a Set of males and I
knew which ones I wanted to breed with so
[SPEAKER_01]: I set those ones to the side and then out
of a certain amount I picked the
[SPEAKER_01]: best-looking one because that's what was
available to me at the time So that was a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit, you know, that's not how I
would do it nowadays But back then I just
[SPEAKER_01]: picked the best-looking one of the set of
you say there was like I think about five
[SPEAKER_01]: or six of the the Tahoe GDP males and I
picked the best-looking guy and he turned
[SPEAKER_01]: out to be pretty damn good obviously,
but overall The the way I'm doing it now
[SPEAKER_01]: and what I would what I would say the best
way to would be you're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously structure and then if you can
get a good smell off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's obviously you know same thing as
picking a female, you know if you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: a good stem rub and you got a you just a
nice kind of a Plant that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: permeates a good smell in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got something to look
forward to and then you know then when you
[SPEAKER_01]: you got a flower that you got a flower it
out, you know and really see how it how it
[SPEAKER_01]: looks when it's you know fills out all of
its You know stems everything how it
[SPEAKER_01]: looks, you know, you're gonna really want
to pay attention to that so I I found that
[SPEAKER_01]: with with once I found the grandpa's
breath male I found the one that was it
[SPEAKER_01]: was tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had some some internodal spacing going
on so it wasn't as tight as my first
[SPEAKER_01]: selection that made the grandpa's breath
and then the The thing once I put in a
[SPEAKER_01]: flower this guy had He just had stacks of
flower clusters that it literally looked
[SPEAKER_01]: like corn on the cob I know I've mentioned
that online before I've told people but
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's like the closest reference I
could find like it literally looked like
[SPEAKER_01]: little husks of corn just solid yellow
that were just these Big, you know foot
[SPEAKER_01]: long, you know thick colas of flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty cool That and the fact that
I saw some resin glands on the leafs I
[SPEAKER_01]: know some people can say that too much
resin or if you see plants that have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of resin on it could potentially be a male
hermaphrodite Or show intersex traits if
[SPEAKER_01]: it flowered and you actually look up close
You might end up seeing some white hairs
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point that's the same as finer
hermaphrodite in your in your other in
[SPEAKER_01]: your female garden You don't really want
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So But this this guy in particular I saw I
saw frost on it and it never showed any
[SPEAKER_01]: any Intersex traits and it was all good
all the way to the end I I thought it was
[SPEAKER_01]: just going to be an absolute stud and I
was right So everything that that
[SPEAKER_01]: grandpa's breath male touched has turned
out, you know, nothing short of amazing So
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been pretty stoked on everything
Killer so moving forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you kind of like the idea of using
resinous mouths?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think just maybe that one
situation it worked out pretty well?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think that would be a trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw I know well, you know,
I mean, I'm I'll be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know I Would say if I'm gonna call
myself a breeder I'll say I'm I'm beginner
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not gonna sit there and
claim to know everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't go to school for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm going off what I feel has worked
for me in the past I'm going off of what I
[SPEAKER_01]: what I think will do great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been right so far so I'm not a knower
at all by any means but the stuff that I
[SPEAKER_01]: did Learn along the way and what I've
picked up on it seemed to work out quite
[SPEAKER_01]: well So I'm just gonna keep going in that
direction I wish I had more scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: terms so I could use and you know a little
bit more knowledge on on the plant itself
[SPEAKER_01]: and how life works in between but overall,
I think When you're growing these guys out
[SPEAKER_01]: you just you get so used to seeing
different plants and how everything Looks
[SPEAKER_01]: that you just you just have a feeling and
you just know when you're going in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right direction some things can end up
being a complete flop, but So far I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't really ran into that issue I mean
some people might not be too happy with my
[SPEAKER_01]: gear like it and that's fine Everyone's
entitled their opinion, but everything
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done so far I I feel like I can stand
behind and say hey, that's a that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: decent strain You may not find the plant
you're looking for but there's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: one out of every line I've released that
someone could say that's one of their
[SPEAKER_01]: favorites or that's one of the ones they
would run again so that's good enough
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers for me, but I would think that
From here on out I'm definitely gonna you
[SPEAKER_01]: know You just you just got a flower out
the mail that you want to use and if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna if it shows you what you're looking
for Then great and if not, then start over
[SPEAKER_03]: Solid answer it raises the idea that I
constantly think of myself as is breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: an art or a science and I think the way to
summarize this question is to put it in
[SPEAKER_03]: this kind of abstract question where it's
if we got all the things that you or maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: generally speaking People consider to be
advantageous about a male Programmed into
[SPEAKER_03]: a computer and then got it to select one
Do you think it would do a good job or do
[SPEAKER_03]: you think as you said?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like this certain feel to it which
would inevitably maybe make the robot in
[SPEAKER_03]: this example Not really do as good of a
job as say a human Man, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tough because with all the scientific
Input and when someone has a computer
[SPEAKER_01]: program that can literally take not just
me but like so many other people that have
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot more expanded knowledge than I Do
you could potentially have such a crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stack of information and all the I mean
the program could runs could run in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that they knew exactly what they're doing
but Again, we could all set everything to
[SPEAKER_01]: autotune on all of our gardens on
everything But I think when it all comes
[SPEAKER_01]: down to it, we all like to be there
physically We want to be involved with it
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'd much rather say that hey I created
this right at that by my own hands by my
[SPEAKER_01]: selection by me going and picking it
smelling it knowing everything That sounds
[SPEAKER_01]: better to me than a robot did or it was
picked by some Auto generated number and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we just went and selected out of the
warehouse, but you might be on to
[SPEAKER_01]: something there I mean, I think there
could be some sort of you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a challenge where someone could say
well Hey we found just as good of a male
[SPEAKER_01]: by this and just by having the general
knowledge in the situation and knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: what we were looking for and Clicked a
number on a computer and bam here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what popped out But like I said
hands-on that's that's number one for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah sure a bit of a crazy theoretical you
just made me think about the idea of like
[SPEAKER_03]: a new breeder emerges and their whole
Advertising campaign is like yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: we use this machine to pick our man At
this day and age I don't I I wouldn't put
[SPEAKER_03]: it past anybody you mean yeah,
they go so a question I love to ask
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders when you're kind of you've
created a new strain and you're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe do some testing yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many seeds do you like to pop to get a
feel of what's inside of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I mean if it were up to me as many
as you freaking can but I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's be real here There's there's certain
things that can restrict a grower whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it is legality or room or You know,
there's a lot that goes into play I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: trust issues you start getting into a huge
thing You have way too much to take care
[SPEAKER_01]: of you have to bring in people and as soon
as you bring in those people You better
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure those people are like family and
away Family isn't necessarily always
[SPEAKER_01]: trustworthy either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just pretty much open yourself up
to getting genetics stolen Having people
[SPEAKER_01]: snitch on you having people get greedy
having the cops come bust you There's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot that goes into the whole having too
many plants to me I want to stay in a
[SPEAKER_01]: position where I feel like I mean I'm I'm
giving the customers what they need I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: testing the plants or having them tested
by friends So one way or another anything
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes out of my camp is being grown
out completely from start to finish And
[SPEAKER_01]: and if there's any issues at all,
we're addressing them if there's too many
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not releasing it if there's any
doubt in my mind it the I'd rather not
[SPEAKER_01]: release the planks like I said if I if
it's not it's not good for him It's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: good look for me if I put something out
that I that I have to get a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: returns on so for me, I'm trying to I
personally Will pop at least a few packs
[SPEAKER_01]: of each one that Hasn't always happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now from here on out, I think that's
kind of where I need to be We need to pop
[SPEAKER_01]: at least, you know, two three packs of
every single strain That's you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially just like anyone else if you
go out and buy a pack of seeds Most people
[SPEAKER_01]: only buying, you know one maybe two and
they do their little fino hunt if I do the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing pop it and I don't find any
issues then that's I mean that's Between
[SPEAKER_01]: me and say a few three four five other
guys are doing the same thing We've just
[SPEAKER_01]: ran, you know a decent amount of the packs
and we all have an idea of what we can
[SPEAKER_01]: look for I used to when things are a
little bit different up here in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: I had I'd have you know 100 100 seeds of
one strain going just to find the the mail
[SPEAKER_01]: and pick out my winners That's what
happened with the grandpa's breath That's
[SPEAKER_01]: not the case anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish it was but I just can't I can't do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be in trouble if I did Yeah,
it's surprising.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you may be aware but a lot of
breeders out there unfortunately are
[SPEAKER_03]: forced to you know Bend or break the rules
in order to you know, kind of do what they
[SPEAKER_03]: feel is, you know, like kind of the right
number I guess Yeah, and and again,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know what the right
numbers I think if I had if I had a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: big warehouse I'd say at least at least a
hundred two hundred of every single one
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're doing things the right way
and you don't have a crazy You know a
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy amount of Finos going on then I mean
you should it with an f1 cross or even
[SPEAKER_01]: others There shouldn't be that many that
you need to select from hundreds of plants
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean I guess it gives you the upper
hand and you have that many one could be
[SPEAKER_01]: growing a bit better and give you an idea
but to me I say you're gonna see what you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to see and in 30 40 plants,
you know, but the more the merrier
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously, but it's just I know that at
this at this point I've seen what I need
[SPEAKER_01]: to see and I know what I'm putting out is
is gonna be good and if not Then I'll hear
[SPEAKER_01]: about it from all my testers and all the
guys before we even gets released.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not an issue Yeah, I totally agree
with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 40 is that magic number as well I
just a quick little reason behind that
[SPEAKER_03]: because some people are gonna wonder why I
say that I think far and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: back this idea up is a 5% is about the
lowest common percentage you'll get for a
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotype to appear obviously you can get
crazy lower outliers, but Generally,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not going to find something that
occurs less than 5% So if you run 40 seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: you guaranteed to find at least one thing
of that 5% and if you don't find it Well,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you know that that phenotype doesn't
exist at that low percentage and anyway,
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about the phenotypes and the
percentages Candyland and false teeth are
[SPEAKER_03]: two of your strains that I'm really
interested in because they got like the
[SPEAKER_03]: different versions associated with it and
I guess the the kind of the deeper idea
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm interested in is this idea of using
multiple females and Offering the
[SPEAKER_03]: different versions hasn't really been
adopted too much, but I have a feeling it
[SPEAKER_03]: might be on the rise Do you think that's
the case and why do you choose to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think it is on a rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I For sure did not start this this
whole let's do a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: versions 1 2 3 4 whatever I've seen it
before even going back to res he had
[SPEAKER_01]: different versions of e2 or whatever it
was and that's and another breeders did as
[SPEAKER_01]: well and I don't remember if it was
because he Remade the strain and so it was
[SPEAKER_01]: a version 2 or if he put out two separate
phenotypes of the same cross But in my
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, that's exactly what happened
and it's kind of a two reasons for that
[SPEAKER_01]: one being when I did the original False
teeth what I had done was I had crossed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know I had popped all the different
Candylands that I had you know from siege
[SPEAKER_01]: from when I worked with kin So I popped a
bunch of Candylands and as I did I started
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing some that were you know,
there was some that were just shit They
[SPEAKER_01]: really just didn't come out that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some mutation stuff going on I
just didn't yield didn't it was anything
[SPEAKER_01]: too fancy those that did come out You know
and looked really good I was it was so
[SPEAKER_01]: hard and it could be the Hoarder in me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but I looked at these plants
like I can't get rid of this one and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know Why I don't know what I'm gonna
do as far as having you know, four
[SPEAKER_01]: different ones that are all full of seed
So what I decide was let's say if I
[SPEAKER_01]: release the one people are gonna find
something good But let's just say that
[SPEAKER_01]: they they're like, yeah, it's okay,
you know But I wish I had something else
[SPEAKER_01]: to choose from or you know a different
selection So I thought if I released all
[SPEAKER_01]: three four versions, I guess the fourth
one just was released but originally three
[SPEAKER_01]: different versions of v1 v2 v3 and it was
all That it was all done same time same
[SPEAKER_01]: breed It was just a different plant number
in the same exact room got hit with the
[SPEAKER_01]: same pollen And what happened was I just
decided to release them all that way You
[SPEAKER_01]: could have a little bit something
different in the next guy a problem I
[SPEAKER_01]: found going back to the old dispensary
days was you'd walk into a shop and say
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I've got cookies they'd say cool we
have cookies and they could be a totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different look than yours and And they
weren't budging they don't want to because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the same thing Well, I figure if you
walk in said well, I've got something that
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got I've got some false
teeth or I've got some candy land that
[SPEAKER_01]: looks a little bit different It's the v3
or v4 whatever, you know, it's a different
[SPEAKER_01]: version and it was something, you know
completely different than the next guy
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they would put it on the shelf
because it was so much different even
[SPEAKER_01]: though I had you know But same kind of
quality pot, you know, so that's what I
[SPEAKER_01]: was originally thinking would be nice But
it did create a lot of confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean everyone ate them up people
bought everything One of those things so
[SPEAKER_01]: they they I think having having something
that'll make you different than the next
[SPEAKER_01]: guy is is What's what people are into and
they want to see that so it's um,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of a benefit I feel like giving
people more options is never bad Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I wholeheartedly agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So little interesting theoretical question
for you If you were gonna go back and
[SPEAKER_03]: remake a strain you'd made before but
let's just say you didn't have the mail
[SPEAKER_03]: you initially used so maybe you're gonna
remake the mail or reselect it from Stock
[SPEAKER_03]: would you like that idea?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like do you like the idea of would you
voluntarily do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess is what I'm asking or would you
just opt to use the original?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it would be cool to use the original
but the original grandpa's breath mail is
[SPEAKER_01]: is is Gone So, yeah, I killed I killed
that guy off a while back he's been done
[SPEAKER_01]: and I just I feel like after I had after I
had released him enough stuff of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I just Feel like you know,
it's time to move on even though I know is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably probably one of the better males
I figured I would find you know out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: progeny once I start cracking into the f2s
of grandpa's breath and I get ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: make the f3s I'll have a new mail that's
selected in for its own reasons So I
[SPEAKER_01]: figured it, you know, he'll make a return
at some point or it won't be him It'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: a different one like you just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got no problem with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's there's it's always
nice to move on and start something new I
[SPEAKER_01]: also feel like having something Having the
same thing And every cross isn't always a
[SPEAKER_01]: good thing like I mean I've ran into that
problem in the rec scene up here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington How trying to sell seeds to
someone saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's this and I go we've already
got a grandpa's breath cross Mike Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you don't have this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's different this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks and smells completely different
It's not the same thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's it's it's a sometimes It's a hard
sell letting people know that even though
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got the same mail You're gonna get
you get completely you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_01]: different results, you know, it's not
always gonna be the same things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Yeah, interesting tapping into a really
interesting point about kind of lack of
[SPEAKER_03]: education within the Consumer scene
something which jumps to mind when you
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned that is I was in Colorado and I
went to a dispensary and I was like show
[SPEAKER_03]: me the best weed you got guys and they
pulled out some cookies and I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: What cut is it and they were like,
oh, it's the Durban cross og cut and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: just yeah, you know, and I was just like
really like you're meant to be the
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledgeable one here like Yeah,
no, it's not gonna work Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to quickly rule out a little
question I'd found I'm not even sure if
[SPEAKER_03]: it's true But I think I ran on a forum
somewhere that like at some point in the
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier days before you did the call You
just mentioned of the grandpa's breath now
[SPEAKER_03]: you did a reselection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was that true or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, actually so what okay, so yeah,
no, you're right we did the original okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: so My first mail I selected of grandpa's
breath That was the Humble pie grandpa's
[SPEAKER_01]: breath f2 foul mouth False teeth all those
guys that was all done under that
[SPEAKER_01]: Grandpa's breath mail then that one was
gone and I had to select another one Which
[SPEAKER_01]: was done To make the sugar daddy Italian
ice Pine and perp and that line the second
[SPEAKER_01]: grandpa's breath line was all done with
the new mail and I feel like all those
[SPEAKER_01]: ones Have turned out just as good if not
better offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's I'm totally space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Sometimes I need to remind myself though
I did do that because I forget at times
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was the grandpa's breath But
yeah, it was a different male for that
[SPEAKER_03]: breed Yeah, no, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we kind of look at some of the ones
you mentioned there None of them were the
[SPEAKER_03]: ones you chose for the new mail I think
you actually end up choosing purple vapor
[SPEAKER_03]: was the first male What was it about the
purple vapor which made you pick that one
[SPEAKER_03]: as your new mail at least of the initial
selection going forward There was a there
[SPEAKER_01]: was a purple vapor and a brandy wine that
were selected at the same time With help
[SPEAKER_01]: from a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to I gave him the last of my
purple vapor and I gave him a bunch of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Brandy wine and in return I said I'd like
you to bring me back all the males So he
[SPEAKER_01]: when he did that he brought a truck full.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I had so many selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh my god, so I had I sat
there in my yard one summer and I was like
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got literally I think I had 20 20 or
25 of each so Looking out all those and
[SPEAKER_01]: then flowering them all out I allowed them
all to just get big and I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: collected the pollen this time I didn't
even take cuts of them I was like this is
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be a once-and-done type of thing So
I got all the pollen that I wanted off the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones I was gonna keep or that I knew I
wanted to breed with The rest of them were
[SPEAKER_01]: discarded and then so in particularly the
purple vapor That guy It was just a badass
[SPEAKER_01]: male like that one and the brandy wine
both just showed extreme close close nodal
[SPEAKER_01]: space and there was like a nice they had I
didn't have as much of a What I I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to call it a cola, but essentially a
male flower cluster cola, whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's probably a more of a
Scientific term for that, but I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: it off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not gonna make one up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, they They they just had a really
good look to them and those ones were the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones ended up being selected For the new
the the wine line, which isn't even I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: I've released a few of those but not all
of those Have been released and in the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple vapor line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there was the first one I released
from that so far I think was the Or one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the newer ones anyway was the biker perps
and that's that Hell's Angel times purple
[SPEAKER_01]: vapor So all those the new ones,
I feel like you're gonna be killer man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel like those ones are gonna be
awesome Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean the brandy wine Is one I'm
extremely interested in mostly because it
[SPEAKER_03]: contains pink champagne.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll jump to that in a second What is it
about the brandy one which drawed you to
[SPEAKER_03]: it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know it's one a cup on its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's probably a good starting point,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, no, it's it's the the brandy
wine itself like we I knew once we started
[SPEAKER_01]: growing that one out it showed so much it
very I don't have a percentage but it had
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the of the the offspring had Some
good signs of pink champagne and that cut
[SPEAKER_01]: in itself I've been smoking for 20 plus
years and I am yet to see one other strain
[SPEAKER_01]: that has that same turf profile Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not come across anything else in all
my cannabis days that have that smells
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly like the pink champagne And I mean
this it has to be the cut from the Bay
[SPEAKER_01]: Area I'm I still don't know the full
lineage of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been told story after story and it's
almost it's more of a secret than anything
[SPEAKER_01]: else people people make stuff up but
there's supposedly or supposedly there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: Some Romulan Urkel and c99 in there
somewhere I can see the c99 or maybe the
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel because of the color but there's
something in it that is it makes it super
[SPEAKER_01]: unique and Like I said, I've just it's
it's unmatched.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Finding anything like that and the
brandy one was super cool and just knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's The potential I knew that
there was something that I was on to
[SPEAKER_01]: something Having the brandy wine in the
lineage I feel like it has a certain kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a sweetness and it adds frost So that
male was a stud and I feel like he it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just another one of the something from
grandpa's breath line that Once it touches
[SPEAKER_01]: the female it just adds so much good stuff
to it that it's it's kind of a no-brainer
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, without a doubt It's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking about this for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh we're gonna geek out of a
Champagne or sorry the pink champagne
[SPEAKER_03]: because I didn't realize that There was
another strain called champagne,
[SPEAKER_03]: but apparently there is But then I yeah as
we're in it right now, I realize it's
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty much both of us just going Yeah,
I don't know what's in it like But that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what's kind of cool man, I mean that's I
kind of was saying earlier there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of I'm not gonna I mean not a fable fables
more of a story like like a kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: made-up story, but I really feel like
there's There's some hidden There's
[SPEAKER_01]: something going on where some people just
don't want Someone to recreate or they
[SPEAKER_01]: just decide to keep it a secret or maybe
they're just they maybe no one really
[SPEAKER_01]: knows but I find it extremely odd that
this day and age they're not I've had a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of Bullshit or step forward and try
telling me that they know what it is and
[SPEAKER_01]: this and that it's like we don't even I
mean, I don't know who you are I've never
[SPEAKER_01]: heard of you and you feed all of a sudden
out of nowhere you pop up on Instagram and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're the fucking creator behind pink
champagne I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Whoever has it or made it out there
Congratulations, you made something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: hold very dear to my heart It's awesome
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I really wish I knew what it was
It would it would it would help a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things out But sometimes it's better that
not to just have a mystery it creates it
[SPEAKER_01]: creates a good Something to talk about
again, you know Yeah for sure for sure I
[SPEAKER_03]: guess kind of the next thing which I found
on your Instagram when I was doing a
[SPEAKER_03]: little stumble through it all was that You
have done some feminine seeds in the past
[SPEAKER_03]: not exactly a staple in the menu But can
we expect to see more going forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes and no, so here's here's here's if
people don't know this those that was a It
[SPEAKER_01]: was a collaboration release.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't breed those a friend who goes by
at Mary Jane wines he was the creator
[SPEAKER_01]: behind the gorilla glue for s1 and the The
gorilla grapes which a lot of people liked
[SPEAKER_01]: and we we still grow and we love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very glue dominant, but You get just
enough of a kind of a Sweet berry thing
[SPEAKER_01]: going on that kind of just adds a little
bit more of a you know Something
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting to the glue, but both of those
released were they were fantastic Got a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of good feedback Except for the glue
out of respect for Josie Wales.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't ever release another glue S1 he
really wasn't happy with that and I can
[SPEAKER_01]: understand but at the same time I didn't
do it so I just released it as a you know
[SPEAKER_01]: to help a friend out but I think it's
something Point yes, you can expect to see
[SPEAKER_01]: more I've been it's been requested of me
so much and I get asked at every show Are
[SPEAKER_01]: your seeds feminized?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I get some you know, there's and it's
always a mixed answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've told people I prefer regular seeds
But I'm not gonna tell you how to grow if
[SPEAKER_01]: someone else wants to grow feminized seeds
and they're hell-bent on I want feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to pick out the males and I
want to I want the risk I want to risk the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential of having herms, you know late
and flower and having to figure out where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're coming from That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can run those from a nice seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I at some point I think I'll probably
You know release them to people but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely not on my Agenda or my to-do
list anytime soon I've got I've got so
[SPEAKER_01]: much other stuff going on and I find what
I'm doing now is a lot more fun And it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's just what I'm into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I haven't I personally have never
reversed a plant To Make the poem it so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's one of those things like I I I know I
can do it but it's just a matter of
[SPEAKER_01]: Setting up the space and getting a little
feminized room going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but again, it's just really I've got
with everything else I've got going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd much rather focus on my regular line
Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So an interesting point you kind of
loosely touched on was Josie Wales and
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of Gorilla Glue moving forward an
interesting point is there seems to be
[SPEAKER_03]: talks I don't know if it's actually
happened but you know of like trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: take more of like a strong legal Stance on
people using their strains and whatnot Do
[SPEAKER_03]: you think how like how do you think about
that idea moving forward and if they
[SPEAKER_03]: became a precedent for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you ever consider using it if people
were like, you know S wanting your strains
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff or do you think like it's not
necessarily the best road we go down as a
[SPEAKER_01]: community There man there's I'm kind of it
I feel strongly about a couple different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one Do I think that we should all be
able to brand our work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but do I am I again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone else using my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think I think there's a fine line
between someone who has a good idea and
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to use your work to You know to make
something special and then some guy that
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to be lazy and just say hey I'm
gonna take I'm gonna take someone else's
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and just make a feminized line out
of his work or I'm gonna take his His pack
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds and cross it to all my stuff and
release that it's like that's kind of I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, that's too easy, bro I mean you
should you should do at least one breed
[SPEAKER_01]: Find a male from that and then cross it to
something But I think at this point if we
[SPEAKER_01]: can all get to where we've got our own,
you know strains that we've made and we
[SPEAKER_01]: are known for it and people can we can if
there's no argument that that we all know
[SPEAKER_01]: that CSI made this strain in there and and
DBG made that strain archive made that
[SPEAKER_01]: strain and those are theirs then those
strains should be ours and it should be no
[SPEAKER_01]: argument But since we all know that's not
the case and many people will abuse that
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we do need to have a little bit more
of a legal standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like everything is going that way
anyway in the canvas industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: so Unfortunately, I wish it wasn't but it
is what it is So you kind of got to follow
[SPEAKER_01]: suit and just run with it So at this
point, I think Trying to get involved with
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I don't know if patenting my
strains is necessarily the right word But
[SPEAKER_01]: but getting them into phylos and there's
another there's another thing some woman
[SPEAKER_01]: presented to me where you can basically
send in clippings of your strains and they
[SPEAKER_01]: you basically get some sort of they do
with flowers and other plants but Kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: branding your work and then you get
ownership of it There's there's certain
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are kind of turning in that
direction and I'm all about it I will
[SPEAKER_01]: follow I'll do whatever I can to get my
strains all listed under so it's known
[SPEAKER_01]: that I made them But whether that makes
them legally mine like I can take you to
[SPEAKER_01]: court and sue you that seems kind of
douchey I mean unless it's a huge company
[SPEAKER_01]: that's gonna be making millions of dollars
off me then at that point Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want my piece of the pie, but I think if
some other guy wants to use you Your
[SPEAKER_01]: strain or something it's and it's with
good intentions Then is it really a reason
[SPEAKER_01]: to go cost stink and then pay a bunch of
lawyer fees and get involved in all that I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't I don't think so but There's
definitely there's definitely a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff going on right now and a lot of
shady stuff going on and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: burning bridges, so I don't know it so it
almost seems like it's it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you should be doing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't protect your business and your
branding Yeah It definitely seems like
[SPEAKER_03]: there are some kind of underhanded moves
being made by some people but Not to drown
[SPEAKER_03]: on that Maybe it even highlight the
opposite if someone did want to breed with
[SPEAKER_03]: some of your work and do it the right way
kind of You know underlying part of this
[SPEAKER_03]: question Do you kind of in general like
when people reach out and say hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I'm gonna do this What do you
think or you just don't care?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like you know, like as in like
yeah do it But you don't need to talk to
[SPEAKER_03]: me or anything or how do you feel about
all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well seen as I'm guilty of it myself I
think that I think that everybody if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna use someone else's stuff,
you should probably mention it to them
[SPEAKER_01]: Like hey, man, I just thought you'd know I
found something killer out of your work
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna use it as one of my females in
my project and then hit it to my mail and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, voila I want to give you some of
the seeds back if you're interested or hey
[SPEAKER_01]: just want to pay homage I'll make sure I
shout you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever There's a lot of stuff that goes
into it and I have not always done that
[SPEAKER_01]: but well I used to see junkies his wedding
cake the cut didn't come from him it came
[SPEAKER_01]: through someone else and I in a roundabout
way hit him up and said hey, man I know I
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about wanting this cut and I ended
up getting it through someone else just
[SPEAKER_01]: want to let you know He's like,
hey man, that's cool right on have fun
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy and there's just a mutual respect I
think so that's different than someone
[SPEAKER_01]: else just using for instance if someone
just all of a sudden crossed You know my
[SPEAKER_01]: grandpa's breath or something to their
entire line which actually just recently
[SPEAKER_01]: happened and then they didn't even mention
it to me and then I Find out that that not
[SPEAKER_01]: only did you not even mention that you're
gonna breathe with my stuff but you you
[SPEAKER_01]: then released it all untested to the
community that's a slap in the face man
[SPEAKER_01]: because then all of a sudden I'm gonna
look like like I'm a part of that in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: like if you didn't test your gear and you
get a bunch of bad stuff coming out of it
[SPEAKER_01]: then all of a sudden my my name is
attached to someone else really shitty
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like that and I also don't like
people, you know just releasing stuff to
[SPEAKER_01]: the community just to make a quick buck
really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's not really cool either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's there's definitely it just
comes down to respect man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel like If someone if they want
to use your stuff, it's kind of an honor
[SPEAKER_01]: in a way, you know There's no reason to be
mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I feel like there's certain
intentions people have that You should
[SPEAKER_01]: just you should just look out for and I
think that some people just don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: give a shit They're gonna do whatever
they're gonna do But I've seen it
[SPEAKER_01]: countless times where some well-known
breeders or people that are making seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: Take someone else's line and drop it
without mentioning anything to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like wow, that's kind of why would
they do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, you know, there's kind
of mixed feelings About it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone gets offended about that,
then I think they already know the answer
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay, so just looping back to a
point you made in the previous question
[SPEAKER_03]: you mentioned phylos How do you feel about
the idea of genetic mapping and kind of?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe kind of in answering the question
you pose where you said, oh look,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know I'm down with the idea of getting
ownership, but not necessarily so I can go
[SPEAKER_03]: and sue people One of the kind of things
about phylos is they say that if you
[SPEAKER_03]: submit your stuff to them it will get You
know mapped and you'll have ownership of
[SPEAKER_03]: it, but it'll go into the public domain so
that like everyone can use it But
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously it's known that it's yours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you do it if that was the case?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, like I really I've been
meaning to meet up with those they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to me for a while and I want to
say at least a couple years about getting
[SPEAKER_01]: together and doing some stuff and I really
I need to do that and I want to do it and
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess I don't understand how it
works I I thought anyone and everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: could turn in a strain and in the fight it
kind of just goes into that map or they
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of just the stars are all on there
with with you know with everything kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: showing where that where it all lands on
the on the on the field, but If there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: way for me personally to say no,
this is mine and have my name attached But
[SPEAKER_01]: then hell yeah, man I think that anything
like that that can kind of put you into
[SPEAKER_01]: the history books as you're the guy behind
it then great because that's kind of where
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had issues in the past where people
are butting heads over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's my strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, it's not I made that one Well,
no, you didn't I made that no three you
[SPEAKER_01]: came out no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean who knows man There's a lot of
stuff that that can really You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can end an argument really quick if it
was known Facts and it was stuff that's
[SPEAKER_03]: been documented already Yeah for sure So
just to loop back on the brandywine for
[SPEAKER_03]: one moment I noticed on your Instagram it
actually kind of snuck by me the first
[SPEAKER_03]: time the absinthe cross Chem dog big part
of this show, you know holds special place
[SPEAKER_03]: in our hearts How do you rate the chem D
and do you so do you see yourself working
[SPEAKER_03]: with the chem in?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, whether it be the chem D the
chem 91 whatever moving forward or was it
[SPEAKER_03]: just more Like a one-off trial thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think that having Kim in my lines is
definitely something that's needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen when I first was working with kin I
had a Kim for I still have Kim for but the
[SPEAKER_01]: Kim for was one that I first was had
access to and I Really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It yielded great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want more of that stank and the chem
deep and the chem 91 which I Which I do
[SPEAKER_01]: have it just hasn't been bred with yet
Both of those have a little bit more Of
[SPEAKER_01]: the smell I'm looking for What I did find
or excuse me what my tester found With the
[SPEAKER_01]: absinthe cross that he just recently
finished up was there wasn't as much Kim
[SPEAKER_01]: dog Smells coming out of his what he
selected as the keepers, which is fine I
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't necessarily trying to create
something that I would say is better than
[SPEAKER_01]: the original mom by any means what I'm
trying to do is just literally release
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's gonna have Some new
smells all together and I know that when
[SPEAKER_01]: you combine such A good parent with
something that I'm offering I think
[SPEAKER_01]: there's there's there's it mixes well and
it creates Let's just say like a new drink
[SPEAKER_01]: at the bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean like we all can go get
the originals We all love and like but
[SPEAKER_01]: then we can go and they may hey try this
one All of a sudden it gives you some new
[SPEAKER_01]: taste on or a new view on on the strain
you already liked and great I did my job
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's kind of where I'm going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, I'm gonna have more Kim in the
line Yes, there'll be more Kim popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now the cross that you see the the
Kim for crossed a brandy wine is Called
[SPEAKER_01]: Kim fusion that one's gonna be coming out
at some point and the same with the absent
[SPEAKER_01]: Kim D times the brandy wine Both of those
are gonna be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I know it but Definitely got to go
through the testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to run them myself, you know
before releasing them and So there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of a wait, but I'd rather I'd
rather always you know put something out
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm proud of then rather just have
someone else's word and just release it on
[SPEAKER_01]: on without any knowledge of what I'm doing
I'd like to have some some Really good
[SPEAKER_01]: lines that include those Kim's but I think
what I'll find once I get those those ones
[SPEAKER_01]: going with some back crossing or if I need
to Just do some in crop whatever I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: do I have a feeling I will I will be
looking for more of the Kim she knows to
[SPEAKER_01]: be popping up to use more of Very
exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I definitely am interested in that
absence So just to pop to another strain
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of snuck by me, but I'm really
interested in hangover haze this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm yeah, I'm Super interested in it
because ghost train haze was big for a
[SPEAKER_03]: minute and then it kind of popped off But
I still think it's a killer strain,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know What is it about it that draw you
to it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you have any of these other kind of
strong sativas that you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and yes, so so the the ghost train
haze It's it's a cut out of Cal out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado I don't know if it for sure came
from the rare dankness camp or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: but one way or another It's got it's got
killer smell it's a It's hard for me to
[SPEAKER_01]: describe smells as much some people have
different way of doing it But to me it was
[SPEAKER_01]: more of that that Kind of like a pine saw
cleaner City, you know like the metallic
[SPEAKER_01]: haze kind of thing going on but with that
cleaner smell in the pie I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: ghost train haze has a very distinct smell
in my opinion and it was awesome Crossed
[SPEAKER_01]: it to the brandy wine and each time I saw
it finish up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very There was you get some of that
lemon and some of the stuff from the mom
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, you get you get kind of a
mixed, you know smell thing going on
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it definitely leads for some
interesting stuff the that one Was one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the more sativa dominant ones I did I do
have some some There's one called
[SPEAKER_01]: redheaded stranger.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a new one in my line That's gonna
be here shortly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a Tom Hills haze with Williams
wonder I believe Wow, that is two
[SPEAKER_01]: powerhouses Yeah, that one right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think will be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple others too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh the Dutch tree the original Dutch tree
I got that one's that one's in flower
[SPEAKER_01]: right now I think that when you eventually
get here with some stuff and we'll have
[SPEAKER_01]: some some new ones to play with but I Like
I said earlier, I like sativa people ask
[SPEAKER_01]: for it all the time Just like that and CBD
and I don't ever I don't hardly have
[SPEAKER_01]: anything to offer them, especially CBD I
have nothing but sativa why is the
[SPEAKER_01]: hangover haze with the first one I could
say that in my Siparo, which the snow cap
[SPEAKER_01]: cross they Those would be two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd dead be leaning toward the sativa side
of things Yeah, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Do you ever plan to work with any
crazy Landry stuff for it's just not
[SPEAKER_03]: really on the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I've got I was I just pulled him out
yesterday I had taken a picture of my seed
[SPEAKER_01]: my seed collection and I have I had
mentioned having land races in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I pulled him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got I've got Nepalese stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got stuff from India There's there's
an issue right now a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that a lot of stuff that that's
coming out of India has been You know
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that was just you know, basically
hemp, you know or stuff that's very low
[SPEAKER_01]: potency Just nothing great and a lot of
people have been just breeding bullshit
[SPEAKER_01]: and and not really paying attention to
what they're doing out there now I do know
[SPEAKER_01]: for a fact that the guy that I got them
from Was a little bit more reputable As
[SPEAKER_01]: far as you know, he's not just going to
the base of the mountain collecting seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew people up in the hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: His wife was from India.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a little bit more of a reputation
He was friends with Ringo who passed away
[SPEAKER_01]: a little ways back and and I believe I
believe DJ short got seeds from him as
[SPEAKER_01]: well at the same time I did and grew some
out and he found some good stuff now Those
[SPEAKER_01]: plants really should be grown outside Or
in the greenhouse or something and right
[SPEAKER_01]: now I only have indoor room to dedicate so
I won't be popping any of them soon but
[SPEAKER_01]: before they go bad, I mean I really need
to get get them in the ground because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's the What could be found in the
seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have would be would be incredible and
I I'm telling you right now I have never
[SPEAKER_01]: seen seeds like these so whatever they are
I have a feeling just based on what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at in the bag I have something
special like they literally look like
[SPEAKER_01]: espresso beans just these tiny little
black things that are just dark and shiny
[SPEAKER_01]: like I've never seen anything like it So
there's definitely some interesting stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: in there but when when I get to pop them
and will they be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Crossed into anything I have who knows but
I I would sure love the idea of that Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what is some genetics?
[SPEAKER_03]: You wish you had right now to work with
that you don't have whether it be just a
[SPEAKER_03]: clone You don't have access to or some
genetics that are from you gone by I
[SPEAKER_01]: recently just got a clone from somebody
that's supposed to be or It's not supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to be it's it's from Duke diamond and it's
a it's one of his I believe it's dominion
[SPEAKER_01]: seed company He has he has some new
skunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been working with and he I would say
if anybody out there right now has You
[SPEAKER_01]: know good feedback on releasing some some
of the old-school skunk that really that
[SPEAKER_01]: roadkill kind of smell there's something
from from from Matt right I hear about all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time this skunk spray afghan,
but there's also the the stuff from from
[SPEAKER_01]: Duke where he He's got this local skunk
and these different ones that are all
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be just just really Bring back
the memories of that old lineage that we
[SPEAKER_01]: all thought was extinct So I'm kind of
looking into that I'd really wish I had
[SPEAKER_01]: some of his stuff because that takes me
back to my childhood Anytime I smelt the
[SPEAKER_01]: dead skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I correlated that to you know smelling
some good green, but so He's something I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like to get into his stuff, but I mean
with all the seeds I have to pop of my own
[SPEAKER_01]: gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like when am I gonna have time?
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything skunk like a real Skunk that's
something I'm after I'd like to see in my
[SPEAKER_01]: line but then also I Don't know who I
don't know who the breeders, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: something called tits.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the shit is what it stands for
There's something like that or sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few out there that I'm a big
sour diesel fan so anything that's got
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that's close to that or has a
very sour smell or just a real just strong
[SPEAKER_01]: funk I'm into that there's there's another
one royal Kush every time I've seen royal
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush I'm absolutely in love with it,
but I know some guys are you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's plenty of people out there
breeding with it some people Are known for
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's like their baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of goes back to what I said
originally like I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily Take what someone else is
already, you know, that's you know
[SPEAKER_01]: something of theirs and then use it in
mind maybe if it was gifted to me or they
[SPEAKER_01]: asked to me to breed with it that'd be
another story, but I think I'm gonna more
[SPEAKER_01]: or less try sticking to Stuff I'm finding
in my own lines and then obviously I have
[SPEAKER_01]: to go back and you know Some of these ones
some of the hyped cuts and some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that people really want to see me
work with I'll end up Using along the line
[SPEAKER_03]: at some time Yeah, for sure a lot of
points to jump into there I'll see if I
[SPEAKER_03]: can quickly bang him out tits was made by
Ben from IC collective And also,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know by extension skunk V a shout out
those two guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love them and Royal Kush is that the the
Long Valley Royal Either long value and
[SPEAKER_01]: see that's what I'm not sure of is it Long
Valley Royal Kush or am I talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: just the Royal Kush number seven?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's I don't know if that's aficionado
or if it's I think it's Mandel bought
[SPEAKER_03]: Mandelbrot Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the Long Valley is the selection
aficionado did of Mandelbrot's royal Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I mean that stuff I mean I was at an I
was at Emerald Cup and I I see these kids
[SPEAKER_01]: pull out paper bags that they've got all
their urban and they're showing a
[SPEAKER_01]: aficionado and he's his eyes are rolling
in his head as he sniffed him I was like I
[SPEAKER_01]: got to see what these kids have they got
they obviously have some fire and So I get
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a hold of these guys I'm like,
let me see what you got and they had Royal
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush and I remember just doing the same
thing as soon as you squeeze that bud and
[SPEAKER_01]: it was outdoor as soon as you squeeze that
bud and give a little twist you just it
[SPEAKER_01]: was Mind-blowing like I I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it had such a good smell just oh my
god, man And even a year after getting
[SPEAKER_01]: that bud I was smoking what I was calling
Christmas weed because that's around the
[SPEAKER_01]: time I got It a year later and it was
still just as good as when I first did it
[SPEAKER_01]: was just gooey Sticky great just really
nicely grown weed out of humble Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: we are the dream, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna push you on one last thing
before we jump back into your own stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: You put a photo out recently kind of
touching on that point You made earlier
[SPEAKER_03]: about being both a seed collector as well
as a seed creator in that photo We can see
[SPEAKER_03]: of your little seed your seed storage
container We can see a few breeders in
[SPEAKER_03]: there I'm pretty sure I can see a pack of
Bodhi at the front nice and center But I
[SPEAKER_03]: can also I also think I can see it's
either like a pack of only or a pack from
[SPEAKER_03]: goo I can't quite make it out doesn't
matter But what I want to know is if you
[SPEAKER_03]: had to pack a few pops from your little
collection What would it be and who are
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the breeders who you currently
jive with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, there's there's so much stuff in
here, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean is but yeah, you're right You're
seeing some Bodhi right there on the top
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some Bodhi gear He's someone he's
one of the breeders who you don't see a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of these shows He's always been kind
of behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met him one time and he was the most
humble down-to-earth the coolest guy I had
[SPEAKER_01]: talked to in a long time and I we was an
honor to meet him And he literally after
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting a guy that you pretty much want to
buy his whole line But you go broke and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it because he's got so many strains
But he he's such a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's like shoot who else I
think what you saw what you thought Was an
[SPEAKER_01]: awning or an on one was seed was it you're
staring at a cannerado pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yes that one and Cannerado he's a good
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a guy I've met quite a few times any
time I see him, you know a handshake and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know fist bump, whatever He's a cool
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see each other a lot the shows If I
was gonna pop anything out of here,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, that's a hard one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got so much stuff in here It's not
even funny But I think honestly,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some stuff right here at the top
from a guy called elite cannabis At a
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado and him and his boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's friends with green dot Green dot Dave
I believe green dot labs Dave at a
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado and a few of these other guys and
they've got these Kim de la Kim crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: and I believe it's a Kim D I-95 cross
something like that and Just I mean all
[SPEAKER_01]: the stuff they've got triangle Kush Kim
dogs everything's crossed this Kim de la
[SPEAKER_01]: Kim and I think that sparked my interest
because Even going back to the old icy mag
[SPEAKER_01]: days all I wanted was the stinkiest Stuff
I could find like that's what sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the gas I want to just the nasty
baby poop stuff just anything that just
[SPEAKER_01]: makes you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so He I have a feeling popping any of
that stuff there I'm gonna find everything
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to call into the nasty category and
then I mean after that probably those
[SPEAKER_01]: Indian land race I mentioned earlier
because I mean I know there's there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: much value and pop and some original land
race and being able to use that and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding to get some pure stuff,
but If it is or not, that's another thing
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna have to get some guys that are
that are very well versed and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: That have traveled or have seen these
things up close and can tell me hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what this is or you know,
you're growing frickin hemp Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: sure on a little side note I spoke to
professor P and he said he grew out some
[SPEAKER_03]: of those chem dealer cam crosses and he's
blown away So you're in for something
[SPEAKER_03]: special if you do pop those ones?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh good didn't know yeah, so Kind of same
topic but a little bit left of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you ever consider?
[SPEAKER_03]: Doing a breeding collaborative project and
if you did How would you want to do it
[SPEAKER_03]: like because I think a lot of people these
days like, you know Each person brings one
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of parent to the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that how you'd want to do it or you
know, some other weird idea maybe It you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what kind of the parents so that's I
did the I did that release for my buddy
[SPEAKER_01]: Mary Jane Windsor Like I said,
you know, that was something we talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about, you know, I had mentioned wanting
to You know have some feminine stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: when people asking for it so much he says
well, I've got You know, I'm making
[SPEAKER_01]: gorilla glue s ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making this thing called gorilla
grapes, you know, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it was a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think I'd like to have a little
bit more Involvement rather than just
[SPEAKER_01]: having someone say hey, this is what I
made here you go and selling them under my
[SPEAKER_01]: brand I don't I there was no issues with
that but I still don't want to do that
[SPEAKER_01]: ever again just because I think it's
better for a breeder to have a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a Say and what's being used and
what's going on that way you can back the
[SPEAKER_01]: project a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think This day and age like I said
earlier, there's a lot of greed and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of shadiness that goes on So
if you're gonna get involved with anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, you probably want to have You
know someone that you've known or that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can work well with and that you're vibing
good with I've got a guy out of California
[SPEAKER_01]: by the name of green gold collective he
was the guy that bred the The lemon Grove
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm currently growing which is the
lemon tree times citrus farmer He told me
[SPEAKER_01]: what he was doing the entire time and I
was like man, that's that's literally a
[SPEAKER_01]: cross I wanted to do and that's awesome
good for you And he's you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when we started talking about
working together on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he did the original f1 cross I'm
growing out them right now He's had a few
[SPEAKER_01]: buddies grow some of them out in
California in the outdoors and in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse and everything's come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will take Selections I've already
pulled bales off the table and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: they're already put to the side,
but I'm growing out females right now
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how that goes and then I imagine
that he'll probably end up having to come
[SPEAKER_01]: up here vice versa And we'll have to check
things out on a little bit closer With
[SPEAKER_01]: inspecting everything but I think we will
end up More than likely releasing that
[SPEAKER_01]: that product together and it'll be
something that we both have seen and grown
[SPEAKER_01]: Both in California and Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be kind of cool I think for any
future project that's exactly how I'd want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be like it's something like either
either you bring the mail or I bring the
[SPEAKER_01]: female but one way or another we meet in
the middle and we are gonna be there
[SPEAKER_01]: through the entire process of seeing and
knowing what's going on and Then even even
[SPEAKER_01]: to a point of harvesting the seeds Just
getting you know, you get the seed counter
[SPEAKER_01]: and you guys just either split it up right
then and there or it's just a trust thing
[SPEAKER_01]: where they know that there's X amount of
packs and we're gonna put them all up for
[SPEAKER_01]: this price and Expect a payday.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know Yeah, yeah, that's obviously
some of the more interesting final
[SPEAKER_03]: logistics One of the things which you just
mentioned that which caught my ear was the
[SPEAKER_03]: citrus farm I wanted to touch on this
because there's so many interesting things
[SPEAKER_03]: about it I guess first and foremost the
skunk tangerine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us a bit about it You know,
it's it's kind of like got a bit of a cult
[SPEAKER_01]: following and it's hard to find info on it
That one is it's it's it came from organ
[SPEAKER_01]: kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not the creator I think he was just
holding it for a while He I believe some
[SPEAKER_01]: guy out of so Cal maybe even San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember Fletcher From archive has
a lot more knowledge on this strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: He told me that when I told him that I had
that cut He was he was he was shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that's that's an old one It's one
that you don't see circulated very much I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess there's a few people that have it
now and I think they're trying to sell it
[SPEAKER_01]: more and trying to get it out there But I
saw a guy was even knowing that I worked
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was trying to get me to pay him $5,000
for a cut So it's definitely something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's being presented to breeders and to
other people as you know, potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: moneymaker and I don't know if it's
because You know, I already bred with this
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know it's not worth $5,000 to me
anymore as a cut But for those people that
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't ever had it I will tell you it's
better than your average Orange strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely got some old-school Feel
to it to where it's just it's not your
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not your watered-down tangy Yeah,
I mean the only thing I'd really been able
[SPEAKER_03]: to read about it was that it was like an
11 week flowering tangerine type of thing
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, very much so and I didn't I'm not
meaning that I didn't I just sound like I
[SPEAKER_01]: was disrespecting Tangy I didn't mean to
say watered-down tangent tangies watered
[SPEAKER_01]: down What I'm saying is it's not it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an original orange strain whoever
made it I think what I've heard was
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some Salmon Creek big bud with
something else crossed to it I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly sure what but the Salmon Creek big
bud I had that back when I lived in
[SPEAKER_01]: California I would have access to that bud
and I absolutely loved it So whatever this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is that makes it the tangerine it
gives it that citrus spell Hands down has
[SPEAKER_01]: has has a better smell than than most
other oranges that I've come across
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many of them nowadays and that
citrus the citrus scene is really hit some
[SPEAKER_01]: people are over it Some people can't get
enough of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of those people that it doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like my daily cup of coffee I'll
drink I'll smoke orange concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll smoke anything tangy anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It leaves that flavor on on the palate And
sometimes there's not much power that gets
[SPEAKER_01]: and that gets associated with the orange
train sometimes Oh, it's not really that
[SPEAKER_01]: stony But one thing I can tell you I don't
know if it's the grandpa's breath of the
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk tangerine on its own But one way or
another though those two create a
[SPEAKER_01]: powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had tests of upwards of High 20s all
the way up to 30% now I know that some
[SPEAKER_01]: tests can get a little bit juggled But for
the most part anything that's testing in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 20s, you know, it's gonna work out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, oh Yeah, I think you touched on a
really relevant point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean You said, you know not to hate on
tangy so to speak and I'm not hating on
[SPEAKER_03]: tangy But it's pretty widely accepted that
it doesn't it's not really bringing too
[SPEAKER_03]: much in the potency department So with
that, yeah, I mean I've heard that yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what you're saying is you've felt
that Yes, yes But what I'm interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: is do you think do you find that the
tangerine hay is on its own?
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously you answered it before where you
said in combination with the grandpa's
[SPEAKER_03]: breath not an issue but on Its own do you
feel it overcomes that or do you feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of the pure tangerine strains?
[SPEAKER_03]: Inherently have this issue of lacking
potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think What I've come across so far
hasn't You know, I I've seen I've seen so
[SPEAKER_01]: many different oranges, you know as far as
the you know from original orange bud or
[SPEAKER_01]: then the calio and then You know more
recently the tangy stuff and then one that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really come across that I'm in love
with Is this Tropicana cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm not sure I think there might be
something to it as far as the orange is
[SPEAKER_01]: all about flavor and That that just blow
your mind smell like when you open a bag I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean if you if you're not a very,
you know Big smoker and you haven't seen
[SPEAKER_01]: that before most people think that
something stung these that smell they
[SPEAKER_01]: relate that to pot You you put a bag of
orange bud underneath someone's nose
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially a female that hasn't smoked or
doesn't smoke and they're blown away like
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't believe that it's coming from a
weed plant You know, so so I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on here is this just like I
said the Tropicana cookies Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some sort of some sort of orange
or something crossed to a cookie plant
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe the cookies is just bringing
that extra potency and making it a more of
[SPEAKER_01]: a well worthwhile strength Yeah,
that's so funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was I was at Bob Hemphill's house and I
saw a giant Tropicana cookies and I pulled
[SPEAKER_03]: it out and I smelled it I was like,
oh my god, this smells like Tangy cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like what's it made of?
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a tangy cross cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like Oh, that's pretty cool,
you know You guessed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so maybe you did too right you hit
it on the head you like orange cross
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies Yeah, no, it's it's there's
there's the one there's this one that
[SPEAKER_01]: circulates called the Mountain Shrop cut
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exactly sure but that one to me
it's got even more of like a fruit punch
[SPEAKER_01]: like I like a red candy, you know,
like like cherry strawberry red kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: candy crossed with the orange Tangy smell
with something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it just creates a whole new kind of
a flavor profile So man, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said these these orange strains
whatever they are they they all they all
[SPEAKER_01]: seem like they have a place and What we
want to have, you know in what we want to
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke on Yeah, definitely and just another
point you quickly mentioned and I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of delve into this a little deeper is
You said when you for example you show a
[SPEAKER_03]: girl who doesn't smoke much this this
orange smelling weed and they get amazed
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly experienced that myself where
people are just blown away by and I
[SPEAKER_03]: thought a little more about it and kind of
what I was thinking is I Think that it
[SPEAKER_03]: happens with more than just the Tangy
because there's been a few strains where
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, maybe it smells like bang on
Blueberry or bang on a mango, you know
[SPEAKER_03]: really accurate like not around but like
perfectly smells like that I think that um
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there's something that goes
on in the mind where it's kind of like You
[SPEAKER_03]: get wowed by the fact that you're looking
at something but it smells like something
[SPEAKER_03]: else and there's like this Miscomputing
kind of factor there because you know that
[SPEAKER_03]: like it shouldn't smell the way it does
With that in mind, do you think that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of like a worthwhile endeavor to
breed for that specific thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think that it's just like no,
it's not really worth pursuing in that
[SPEAKER_03]: regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think that back in the day there was a
lot more the whole you know, I mean the
[SPEAKER_01]: names were given names because of why they
smell like for instance blueberry is
[SPEAKER_01]: called blueberry and we named it was named
that because of how closely it resembles
[SPEAKER_01]: either the real blue bit like a blueberry
muffin or Artificial blueberry candy
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you know mean and that that I'm
not sure that we're steering away from
[SPEAKER_01]: that because they like for instance citrus
farmer it's the name implies, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing something with citrus but
sometimes people I don't think we're
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily sitting around and waiting
till the very end and you You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're testing, we throw all this
weed out on the table, we start rolling
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff up and like, oh man, this one smells
like mangoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we're going to call it mango this
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I feel like nowadays we're doing
things a little bit different and just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to be the first to come up with
this creative name before someone else can
[SPEAKER_01]: steal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with all the breeders and everyone
making stuff now, it's almost hard to be
[SPEAKER_01]: original.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it took me three times recently to
come up with a strain because every time I
[SPEAKER_01]: named it and thought I come up with
something awesome, here we are with
[SPEAKER_01]: someone else who had already named it
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of have to be really creative
and just kind of come up with something
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes sense, but doesn't necessarily
resemble what you're going to get in the
[SPEAKER_01]: end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tropicana cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one, obviously you, like you said,
man, this smells like trop, it's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: tropical cookie or a citrus with the
cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spot on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that would go under the,
uh, uh, perfectly named category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas some of the stuff I've released,
you know, I have Palpatine like,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it smells like an old man and a cloak
on a, on a ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's just named that because it was,
it was just a play on words with,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the, with the lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, there's, there's definitely
names that, that, that reflect end results
[SPEAKER_01]: or end, end, uh, smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's something that I,
I, I feel should be paid a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some woman told me the brandy wine
that I presented to her, she says,
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a chef.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't smoke pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This smells to me exactly like fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was either mango or some sort of fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I had never thought of it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was stuck on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's got kind of a, a fresh floral
dank smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, no, it smells like
mangoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everyone's got their own opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that some, sometimes I almost
feel like having a blind taste test panel
[SPEAKER_01]: and someone like where, where people that
don't smoke, you put all your weed in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of them and let them decide,
Hey, what does this smell like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you get a completely different,
uh, feedback and a completely different,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, result than what you were looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I, I've done it already with
people that don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hilarious what they say compared
to someone who's, who's, who just gives
[SPEAKER_01]: you the average answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it smells dank bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That smells like weed or, you know,
it smells like there's a skunky or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, like you start hearing things that you
never would have thought of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like when, when it comes to
breeding, that might be something that we
[SPEAKER_01]: all might want to get back into is trying
to get closer to what does it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: really smell or taste like, but that'll,
that we, there's only so many things we
[SPEAKER_01]: can name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like then we'd already be already past
like all the existing fruits and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't even know how it would be
original with that, but we'll,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll figure it out one way or another.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you raise a really valid point about
being original with names?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's getting to the point where it's,
it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you said, you know, you had to go back
to the drawing board three times and we
[SPEAKER_03]: even see some people admittedly not common
or from the biggest breeders, but you see
[SPEAKER_03]: some, some breeders will put up a list of
names before they've even made the
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, all right, reserving these
ones now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been, I've done it myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, it's kind of like cutthroat,
like you got to get in there quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think will be the end
solution?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause eventually, you know, like we're
going to be doing rolling over dog next to
[SPEAKER_03]: puddle, you know, just like ridiculous
stuff that hasn't been taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to me, it's, it's kind of a,
it goes back to the respect thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, I put, I put up something
recently and said Arctic grape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was original.
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't find it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it turns out red-eyed genetics has
already had this strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do they have it, it's already
floored out and they're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas I'm just starting to test and just
getting done with my first test of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I'm like, well, they've got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're ready to release.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who am I to step in front of them and say,
no, I'm keeping that name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like, well, you guys got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're ready to go have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that having strains that have
the same name as someone else,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, that's a shot in the foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to help me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some, someone walks into a club or starts
buying seeds or telling you what their
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite strain is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, Oh, I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, well, which one from,
do you like that one from these guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like it from those guys better?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, is it, is it really hurting
anybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure, but I think I just make a
lot more sense and be a lot easier on all
[SPEAKER_01]: of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we just had one, one person who is
known for their strain, like I'm not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to, like, you're not going to come,
another person is not going to come out
[SPEAKER_01]: with dosito tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only would you create so much of a
headache to yourself by trying to do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's just like, why would you name it
something that's already become famous
[SPEAKER_01]: with someone else?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it just, it's kind of like,
it's just pointless.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, yeah, we really should focus
on trying to, you know, be original,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also just when it comes down to just
it's whoever's quick, the quickest or the
[SPEAKER_01]: most creative person wins, whoever was
first to put it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and yeah, I don't know, I guess
naming strains before it's even done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, is that good or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know, because if you wait
till the end before it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it's done, then you name it,
then that name could be taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're stuck trying to figure out a
name when you got something that's ready
[SPEAKER_01]: to release and it becomes a pain in the
ass for marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and, and trying to get stuff
into production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, people may not be aware of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been, we've been talking about doing
this one for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to ask this question cause I
started writing these questions a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time ago and this one's been on the list.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like the very first one I wrote and
it's, it's a little out there,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, a little birdie told me that back when
you were working at GDP, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so this is nothing about you, obviously
that Bay 11 won an award.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone told me that what got entered in
the cut wasn't actually Bay 11.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually Appalachia, which is one
of the parents of Bay 11.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Get ready for, get ready for the spilt
milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there, there was multiple things that
happened while working under granday and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not trying to throw anyone under the
bus or talk any shit, but let's,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's keep it real here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Facts are facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a very factual person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like liars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like taking claims for things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sure as hell like misrepresenting
strains when it comes to awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like all that stuff goes into
karma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and if you're, if you think that by
lying about your, your plants and lying
[SPEAKER_01]: about what you're entering just to win a
cup is going to help you in the long run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, where's granddaddy now?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's your answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happened was Bay 11, apparently
Bay 11 plant was, uh, AKA Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was stolen from Bodie from,
um, uh, uh, an ex garden worker or some
[SPEAKER_01]: guy that had access to Bodie's plants at
his, at his facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: He supposedly took this plant and brought
it to Ken and then they changed the name
[SPEAKER_01]: to Bay 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bay was their head growers name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, you know, he got credit for that
one and called it Bay 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it sounds cool, I guess,
but I, I don't know much more than that
[SPEAKER_01]: other than the fact that yeah,
it was, uh, it was straight up Appalachia
[SPEAKER_01]: entered as Bay 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, just like back in the day,
what the way you do it, you market these
[SPEAKER_01]: strains, you enter the cup and then guess
what happens right after the cup,
[SPEAKER_01]: you release the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's kind of hard to release,
you know, what you just entered in the cup
[SPEAKER_01]: when you got the, what entered the cup was
a clone only.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they crossed everything with their male
GDP or whatever they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Bay 11 seeds were born.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really in all reality, anyone who
bought Bay 11 was more than likely buying
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachia times, uh, GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or GDP bag seed at that, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's not even pure GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure GDP is a clone only as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of, it's kind of a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to go, to get further more into
that, let's, let's, let's go into the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, let's go into the very next cup after
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The very next cup was, uh, was one while I
was there, we won third place for Ken's
[SPEAKER_01]: Phantom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ken's Phantom is, uh, our beloved pink
champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pink champagne was gifted to a
granddaddy perp collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2011 or 2012, whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was then grown out and that was
entered into NorCal cup, San Francisco or
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I believe it was 2012 and it was
entered as Ken's Phantom and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: straight up pink champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, another strain gifted to their
collective and then turned into something
[SPEAKER_01]: else they won with at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sure enough, right after that,
uh, seeds are then released and it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it's, it's the lineage on the pack
said, uh, uh, cherry pie times GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still to this day, I get messages or
someone's like, Hey, so I know that the
[SPEAKER_01]: Phantom, uh, or Ken's Phantom Kush or
whatever, no, not Phantom Kush,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Phantom cookies or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I get confused now because there's so
much nonsense that's associated with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one way or another, it was,
it was not pure, uh, pink champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not the same thing entered as the
cup, which then leads me to my next,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, bit of, uh, spilt milk was the,
uh, their candy land entry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won first place for candy land.
[SPEAKER_01]: That again was either animal cookies or
forum cut or platinum cookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever cut that came through their
collective was turned in as candy land.
[SPEAKER_01]: When in all reality, it was just pure
cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: My pack of candy land is bogus.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't think that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise you that the seeds that were
made were, were cookies crossed to GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there was some really good fines
out of there, but, but no, I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some good, good spilt milk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See high and lonesome was another guy off
the forums and he kind of got into me when
[SPEAKER_01]: I, cause I was, I was grand at a perp rep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, that was the guy behind the,
behind the company online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone was like, yo, that's some
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I agree with you, but what can I
do about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just the spokesperson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the guy that made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I'm not the one turning stuff in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the one making these horrible
decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a, it was kind of a pain in the
ass cause I'm sitting there being,
[SPEAKER_01]: being the poster child for granddaddy and
I had to take all the heat all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what got old too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's nothing worse than getting
yelled at for something you didn't do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well good to be out of those days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, very much so.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something the fans always came to hear
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are, you know, pretty big on organic
growers on the show, probably partly
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's what I am, but I don't
think that's what you are, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: to rule the question out, are you organic
or synthetics?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your preferred style of growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I have been doing for the past
shoot, I mean for years now has been,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm a cocoa grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer pure cocoa core.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no additives, nothing just straight
pure cocoa core.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's house and garden cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's just whatever's available,
but you got to watch the salts,
[SPEAKER_01]: the salt buildup in that cocoa sometimes
is really, really bad and you end up going
[SPEAKER_01]: into the, it just looks like straight
lockout for weeks until you get it flushed
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, I don't really like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tend to go with a little bit higher
end cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, I use Mills
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of additives I've been
playing with, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_01]: elite, elite 91, uh, for roots and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, my Mills and Mills does have
some organic stuff in it, but for the most
[SPEAKER_01]: part, it's, it's a synthetic nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, how do you feel about this one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've always had this interesting
perspective where I've never had anyone
[SPEAKER_03]: give me like really, really, really good
synthetic stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously I'm in Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, a bit of a different game,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel the same?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you just think it's not, not really
much of a difference to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: To really, it, it comes down to,
I love weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone presents me something,
hydro dirt, pro mix, I mean, I don't care
[SPEAKER_01]: what you grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know how to grow and you do a good
job and you bring me something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't, I don't have to completely destroy
the bud to get the smell out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I can obviously look at it and tell
that it was grown with love.
[SPEAKER_01]: You trimmed it up nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't bring me wet weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's, there's, there's so much
that goes into it, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: organic, I had some of my, some of the
best tasting pot has been organically
[SPEAKER_01]: grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned captain Crip earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried some of his blueberry and some of
his, uh, he had a strength called super
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I it's extinct now, as far as I know,
I don't think anyone's got super fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore, but that was one of the tastiest,
like I cannot describe how good that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, I don't know where it's at
anymore, if it's gone or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I believe, I believe everything
he grew was organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was, there was a few other
gentlemen that brought me examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, organic was, was absolutely
killer, but just because you grow organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't mean you're going to have good
taste in weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you don't know what you're doing,
you don't know how to play or build that
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and get that stuff out of there and,
and, and make sure it doesn't show up in
[SPEAKER_01]: the end, then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're going to have, you're going
to have some harsh tasting, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that's not that great anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think depending on who who's grown it
and if they have their, if they've got
[SPEAKER_01]: their system dialed in, then I truly,
I don't really have a preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I just, I love smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's got good flavor and it's got
some good smell, then sometimes even when
[SPEAKER_01]: plants don't have the best flavor and I
can tell it either wasn't flushed
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily correctly or not, but it's got
an extremely good smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up smoking anyway, because I just,
I can't get over that, that smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, I totally agree with you on that
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing I just want to quickly ask,
cause you brought it to my mind when you
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned, um, Captain Cripp's name,
another name that Phantom or Pink
[SPEAKER_03]: Champagne, sorry, I should stop saying
Phantom, Pink Champagne, um, that it goes
[SPEAKER_03]: by is Kryptonite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you heard that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you know where it maybe comes from?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't know who gave it that
name or what, but like that, and this is,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just goes along early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so we all have the same strain,
but for some reason, some guy was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what, I'm growing pink champagne,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I like the name Kryptonite better,
or I think I like the name, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: Raspberry Kush or there's, or there's
another one that it's called wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can see wow being a better name for
it because every time I've ever grown it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I say wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's like you smell the bag and I
can just see a budtender going,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, and that, that would make more
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these other strains just,
just, just to throw another name on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I feel like there's, there's,
there's been a lot of that and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really help anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure who decided to dub it
Kryptonite or maybe they didn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I know that the guys out of Florida
had been calling things Kryptonite or
[SPEAKER_01]: Crippy or crypto for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not to confuse it out of Florida or
confuse it with an OG Kush or the triangle
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything, any other story like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was, I went into a Seattle club
once and they, they had it as Kryptonite
[SPEAKER_01]: and I said, man, that's, that's pink
champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: I breed with that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's, like I said earlier,
there's only one strain I've come across
[SPEAKER_01]: that smells like this and it's always pink
champagne.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they told me that, oh yeah,
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from the Bay area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure where they got that name though.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one of those ones that got attached
maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So point you made earlier on, and then I
sidetracked us, but you know, I'm taking
[SPEAKER_03]: us back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of liked, and you said you liked
the idea of sticking within your own
[SPEAKER_03]: lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a concept I like to explore
because not only is it kind of good for
[SPEAKER_03]: picking males, but I don't think enough
people really delve into their own females
[SPEAKER_03]: when they're making selections.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this a conscious decision for you or it
just worked out that way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I understand, are you asking like
how am I, how I'm feeling now about using
[SPEAKER_01]: within my lines?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, do you consciously like to say,
like, let me put it this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of breeders, they'll use like a list
of clone onlys that they breed with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like a new male to that list and
they never incorporate females that
[SPEAKER_03]: they've just created.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas you will, you know, this round
I've got to keep a brandy wine female and
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to keep a hot rod.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm going to cross the purple
vapors to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so basically I think that rather than
always creating new F1s, which people do
[SPEAKER_01]: want, people want to see the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to see the new hype strains
cross to something you've made.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely a place for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what needs to happen also is
for you to show enough confidence in what
[SPEAKER_01]: you've created to know that, look,
this one was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, this plant is the shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was crossed to this one,
which is another one of my creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It now created something even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, someone who's really doing this a lot
lately, I can, I can see it's working out
[SPEAKER_01]: quite well for him is a exotic,
exotic genetics has, he has put his
[SPEAKER_01]: strains out there to a point where enough
people know them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a household name with everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just because of the ice cream,
uh, there's, there's people growing his
[SPEAKER_01]: tons of his strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you see crosses of those strains
with this one and that one and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're absolutely killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's, if you look up the
lineage though, you can clearly see,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, this one's got Shervin and this
one's got thin men.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in all, in all reality, what you're
staring at is still his creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has then created, there's two strains
he made put together and it creates
[SPEAKER_01]: something even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, some people who aren't,
you know, the most educated or people that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't, maybe they don't know Mike,
they might not know what this one is
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking for, Oh, I want the girl
scout cookie cross to that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little did they know girl scouts in both
plants, but they just don't see that name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there, to me, I think there needs to be
a little bit of a balance of having,
[SPEAKER_01]: having the wedding cakes and the,
and the, the Royal Kush, the, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the clone only is that everyone's wanting
crossed with stuff that's new and exciting
[SPEAKER_01]: to make a new strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also showing people that,
Hey, I I'm working my own strains and not
[SPEAKER_01]: just always throwing out new stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm back crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm furthering the filial generation by
taking them to F2, F3, F4.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I want to head.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get some of my most,
you know, my best, my favorites,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that people have bought out and
that are sold out and have been sold out
[SPEAKER_01]: and that keep getting requests for those
ones will be first to be created again
[SPEAKER_01]: into F2, F3 and further, or a rebread to,
you know, even just bring them out again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people have access to the beans,
but definitely want to have a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, like we said earlier,
something with maybe some feminized down
[SPEAKER_01]: the line, I want to have a complete menu.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I'll say about my stuff is I
haven't released a hundred strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't release huge lines at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I've released a total of, you know,
I want to say like under 20 strains in the
[SPEAKER_01]: four years I've been going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I'm, I mean, and not to say that
I'm better than anyone by any means that
[SPEAKER_01]: could also just mean I'm way too slow for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my opinion, it's given me enough
time to represent what I've got and given
[SPEAKER_01]: people enough time where they can have a
chance to grow every one of my strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I've dropped another 50 on them,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where, that's kind of
where I'm heading.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make it to where there's enough
strains that, that people are interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in, but also there's stuff there that
makes me relevant and we can still get
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that's, you know, exciting and new
to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: An approach I'd certainly can see the
value in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You banged it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You actually banged it on the head when
you, when you were said, Oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: one person who's having success with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, exotic genetics,
exotic genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to give you a bit of a test.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I think that there's a little bit of
an issue in the scene and it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not the one bringing this up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm certainly not taking credit nor am
I the first to talk about it, but I think
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a bit of an issue within the scene
of some of the breeders, certainly not
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself who use like just the same
females, you know, the same clone onlys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so everyone's got a cross of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's got a cross of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you, do you see that problem yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: And in my mind, here's the test,
you know, in my mind, I'm thinking of one
[SPEAKER_03]: specific clone only that everyone's just
breeding with at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know, I want to know if you can
guess it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're talking about purple punch,
then is that what you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: That wasn't, but it perfectly fits the
category.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you one more guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not purple punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's not punch, then God,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, I'm going to, I don't,
I'd have to think, I'm sure I know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's just, it's not coming to my mind
right this second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to give you consolation prize
because purple punch fits the description
[SPEAKER_03]: so bloody brilliantly, but, and,
and again, you know, I'm not having to go
[SPEAKER_03]: GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and, and that's, you know what is so
funny about GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, hardly anybody gives any credit to,
to the creator.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breeder is Mamiko seeds or Mamiko or
however you pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've heard a couple things here and
there, and I'm not going to get into that
[SPEAKER_01]: story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I do know is if you are the man
who made those seeds and those seeds then
[SPEAKER_01]: were, you know, someone found something
GMO as it's dubbed from those seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: that breeder should still be getting as
much credit as the guy that found that
[SPEAKER_01]: clone only now skunk master.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure he has, and he's given out,
you know, plenty of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: of, of praise to Mamiko and these other
people that could have been involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think he is killing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some good things going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy's taken stuff to another level
with his breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that he really did put a,
put the, the name to GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just like Girl Scout cookies and some
of these other ones that have been highly
[SPEAKER_01]: bred with, uh, everyone's jumping on,
jumping on the, um, the GMO bandwagon,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's so many people that love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got, it's got some power.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some stank that just is unmatched
and it really is, uh, it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a decent plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get why a lot of people are breeding
with it, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's kind of cool is even though there
could be 20, 20 different breeders out
[SPEAKER_01]: there that have a gorilla glue,
a purple punch, a GMO cross, a Girl Scout,
[SPEAKER_01]: we all may have it, but what we don't have
and what sets us all apart is that male
[SPEAKER_01]: selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what's going to give you the
different effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause even though we've all got a GMO,
you might end up with some GMO dominance
[SPEAKER_01]: in each one of those crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're also going to get is the
mix of flavors that you might not have
[SPEAKER_01]: expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what really could end up, uh,
bringing some cool things to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone's got their own their own
cross and we all get credit for it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, GMO is, that one's definitely
making its waves now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is going to be a bit of a weird
question, but I'm kind of interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: discontinued strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some breeders out there do it because
maybe they've just lost interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: selling the strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it didn't sell that well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a whole variety of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the time I always find it's not
the obvious reason, which is like,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was maybe some issues with the
strain or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, anyway, what type of things do you
think about if you were to consider
[SPEAKER_03]: discontinuing a strain?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, do you just think like, Oh,
if it just didn't really impress me that
[SPEAKER_03]: much and it didn't make much of a splash,
I'd probably discontinue it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how does that thought process go for
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, I mean, you pretty much just
mentioned or just said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think, so my original grandpa's
breath line, there was, there was,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's 10 or 11 that I released,
um, long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lost soul, swamp thing, purple vapor,
East Jersey, Mike, the ones that had the
[SPEAKER_01]: popular mothers, you know, the OGs,
the GDP, the East coast diesel,
[SPEAKER_01]: those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then my hot rod, the hot rod had
the motor breath in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that's got the real popular,
um, you know, gassy female, it seems like
[SPEAKER_01]: it went the quickest, but at the same
time, some of these other ones like
[SPEAKER_01]: Palpatine, it's got the death star in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that leads me to believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something with the name that
makes it not sell very good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something with, you know,
what, what exactly is it going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where, cause I don't see as many people
growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so it sells great.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have bought a ton of the seeds,
but it's very few and far between that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: posting a Palpatine picture compared to a
brandy wine or some of these other ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that have really made a big splash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I got to ask myself,
is this something that I want to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring out and then maybe make another,
you know, F twos of it or even further on
[SPEAKER_01]: and then often to people, if it hasn't
really done that well in first place,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I need to do like a feedback,
like a, like a poll and see what people
[SPEAKER_01]: think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at this point, like you mentioned,
I'm going to be judging, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what, what to continue based on
popularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it's sold out and I get the ones
I'm getting messages about all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: swamp thing, lost soul, purple vapor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those ones were great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ones that haven't even sold out
yet brandy wine and actually grandpa's
[SPEAKER_01]: breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, the original F two, not the
different versions, but the original F two
[SPEAKER_01]: is finally all the way gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and I'll be making F threes of
that soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then that's going to create
a whole new thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that one in general will always be
held dear to my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's what started the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these other ones, I just feel
like they'll kind of fall off because they
[SPEAKER_01]: either, yeah, they either weren't as
popular or I just didn't see like every
[SPEAKER_01]: show I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned, I get people coming by
with, with samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some, sometimes if I just never get
brought in a sample, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: that just, again, tells me that no one's
growing this strain or it just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't that great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another reason why I guess I
would just ditch something as if it just
[SPEAKER_01]: never showed up and I don't see anyone
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then obviously it didn't, it wasn't that
special.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a quick little side note on the
topic of special.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's your little special seedling vile
going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the vile shoot, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I have to talk to my buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I'm not sure that was all a joke,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it wasn't ever meant to be
something that was going to be going or
[SPEAKER_01]: like it was literally a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was so much, um,
a lot of stuff got brought into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know if you're a well,
well aware, but there's been, I seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: attract a certain amount of, uh,
I don't want to say negativity cause
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of a bad look, but I mean,
there's sometimes my posts can get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit crazy as far as what's said in
them and what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and something as simple as me showing
off a vile with a seed in it and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: look what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: This popped in them in the, uh,
in the washer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't in by any means, I was not trying
to dis anybody or saying, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can pop my seeds in a, in a,
in a, in a washing machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get them to pop you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You suck.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no, there was no negativity
attached.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't trying to bash anybody,
but for some reason, some people decide to
[SPEAKER_01]: take it that way and say, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just hear you are talking shit
about us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't get your seeds to crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Nope, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for some reason it went that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that, that vile thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's still alive, uh, it was literally,
it was just a funny fluke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just thought it was hilarious to
show that it was actually growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought how amazing, uh, a seed is so,
so like wants to grow so bad that it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it continues to live inside of a
basically like a little test tube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured if I had that seed, I would grow
it out just cause it's like, man,
[SPEAKER_03]: you earned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to, I need to call.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him up and see, you know, Hey,
is that thing still going?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, what did, what did you do with
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He he's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: He might still have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He might not, but it was all, it was all
just supposed to be just a look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't this cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't supposed to be anything
negative attached in some reason it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I deleted the post or just
turned off commenting, but one way or
[SPEAKER_01]: another, it was like, it went south real
quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's full on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure I sussed it out and like
didn't seem like you, I'm pretty sure what
[SPEAKER_03]: the comment you had said on it was really
quite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neutral, but people will interpret things
the way they will.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, I'm really not a jerk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be anyone that's ever met me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they know I can joke around a lot of
whatever, but I definitely don't insult
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone just, just because that's not,
that's not me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just talking on like a bit of a weird
topic, but it's one we used to talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of died off seed tampering used to be
kind of like a hot topic, but as I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's fallen off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably due to the fact that a lot of
people have adopted more sophisticated
[SPEAKER_03]: methods of packaging and trackaging and
authenticity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this something you hear about and
something you, uh, how should I say
[SPEAKER_03]: legitimately concerned about anymore?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it, it, it was always a hard one
because you have a guy who, as seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: as the guy's releasing the seeds,
we're, we're, we're giving them to these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys at a, at a cost to where they're
going to make their money off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think about it, I'm selling my
own brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy is selling up to 10, 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, I guess you can't put it past anybody
because everyone's conscience is a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit different than the other guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for a man that could be making as much
money as you could by selling so many
[SPEAKER_01]: brands of seeds, I don't see why for any
reason, why you would take out any of
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds and try and switch them out to
have someone grow them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some of these guys breeds,
for instance, Tropicana cookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we mentioned, earlier, or even some
of my own creations.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow that out, there's certain
things that are expected and they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: tested and we've seen what they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of a sudden, some guy says,
yo, I grew out your, your this or that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it looks super funny or it doesn't
have, you know, what I was expecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you do, where'd you get those from?
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing you know, the guy's called
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't, it wouldn't take very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: That scheme would only work for so long
before you get called out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, I think that, uh,
with, with the seed tampering,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that there's definitely
some shadiness that goes along with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some guys might've done something
like that, but with my gear, I haven't had
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone send me pictures of anything or
show me something that didn't make me feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like, um, there was, uh, you know,
any issue at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I, like I mentioned, I started
using the can verify stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from here on out, if you can't give me
a QR code or show me that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: give me the number off the back of your
pack, then it's, it's not really anything
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, all my stuff will
be, will be fully verifiable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you feel about the idea of
outsourcing a crop?
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why I bring this up is because
in the past, a few people who have had
[SPEAKER_03]: some issues with some seed crops,
generally that's one possible reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they'll say, Oh, well,
you know, I had someone make the crop for
[SPEAKER_03]: me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not kind of in the way that you mentioned
with a friend, but as in like,
[SPEAKER_03]: they pay another company to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this something which you think is
acceptable?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, cause a lot of people will
say that when you get to a certain size,
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got to look at things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think that that's just not the
type of thing you would be willing to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're actually like talking about stuff
I'm currently seeking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done working on this right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I, what I touched on earlier was not
having enough room and not not having
[SPEAKER_01]: enough area to do these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and with the current legal
status of where cannabis is, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these States are requiring you to be a
licensed up producer processor or somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: have a licensed facility to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical is still alive and thriving in
some States, but even then you're not,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not allowed to just grow ungodly
amounts of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have to be in with,
with whatever your States requirements
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to, to, to move forward with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is to find people you can
partner up with who yes, are in these
[SPEAKER_01]: other States and have facilities ready to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've built relationships with,
with some people in Michigan, in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: California, obviously up here in
Washington state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a guy who's in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's these, all these, these places
have the potential to give me a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of room to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's other guys out there that
are doing this and this is how they've
[SPEAKER_01]: become so successful and how they're able
to produce as much as they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I can tell you is,
whereas I, some people are wanting to have
[SPEAKER_01]: the bigger space so they can produce more
and more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm literally looking to just have more
area to breed with and bring back stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and work on the things I've already got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want a hundred new projects,
but I do want to release.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones I mentioned earlier, getting them
back into a deferred further generations
[SPEAKER_01]: of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also making new crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all good, but I still, I really
want to focus on, on certain things and,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's with these extra spaces that'll
give me the opportunity to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as you've got a good
relationship with these guys, I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a, it's a winning combination for them to
open up some space for you to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I think they see the value
because for them to have a new strain that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can then have a selection of that is
your cut or your, what you're standing
[SPEAKER_01]: behind and saying, Hey, this is one of my
keepers from this crop or from this,
[SPEAKER_01]: from the seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they are then allowed to have that,
you know, that plant and it sets them
[SPEAKER_01]: apart from someone else because they've
got something no one else has.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is kind of more on the mechanics
of breeding, but do you ever do anything
[SPEAKER_03]: different when you are doing a seed crop
versus say a sensei crop in regards to say
[SPEAKER_03]: like nutrition or lighting or just
anything, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, for the most part, I I'm growing
exactly how I would within the other
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can say that when, when growing,
when growing your sensei, obviously you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going, you're trying to make the absolute
best thing possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure you're hitting every
single, every single feeding, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure that those things
are coming out 10 out of 10, not to shy
[SPEAKER_01]: away from saying that you shouldn't have a
perfect crop by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that with a seed crop,
you could be allowed and it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: forgiving if you were to feed a little bit
less nutrients, because you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants trying to produce the seed,
not necessarily the, the, the best looking
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers, but I think it's a good principle
to probably try and grow the healthiest
[SPEAKER_01]: plants you can, whether you're growing for
seeds or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that in doing so, you could
probably maybe schedule back a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: on the on the nutrients and some other
stuff that you normally would do,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it might not, it doesn't
necessarily require it as much,
[SPEAKER_01]: but as long as your plants in good health
and you see yourself producing everything
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking to do, then it should be
fine.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So an idea I love to run by all breeders
is where do aesthetics or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: bag appeal as generally referred to,
where does this rate for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this something you constantly got in
the forefront of your mind when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: making a cross, or is it really kind of an
afterthought?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably one of the first things
because to me, like I mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: I said something about, you know,
having, having strains that set you apart,
[SPEAKER_01]: you go into the dispensary and they've
already got, you know, they've already got
[SPEAKER_01]: something or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you have, if you've got something
that just right from the beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: they, they look at your jar, they see that
you open your bag and it's just shining or
[SPEAKER_01]: it has a certain color or it has something
to the look of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I see there's a certain type of,
uh, there's this some weed I've seen that
[SPEAKER_01]: has the hairs come out kind of a puffy
look and it kind of just, it wraps around
[SPEAKER_01]: the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, the hairs are not very loose
from the, uh, from the actual flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has a real tight look to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen buds like that and they
literally always stand out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just a certain look that I,
that I can say that I've always really
[SPEAKER_01]: loved about some, some types of a pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I feel the same way as far as
dispensaries go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to see something that's going to
stand out to the next person, but also the
[SPEAKER_01]: smell can, can really take you away from
that because you know, this, another hyped
[SPEAKER_01]: up strain skittles, the skills cut that's
going around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've more times than not have seen it
where it doesn't necessarily look like the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest quality flower, but that smell and
flavor are so incredible that it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you forget about the looks of it real
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want to smoke another joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I think there's a lot of strains
out there that are like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not be the prettiest,
but damn the, the high it produces and
[SPEAKER_01]: the, um, the smells that are coming off of
the plant are, are worth growing it in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do really hold, um, the bag of pill
high on my, on my scale of what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for with stuff, but also,
um, you know, taste, smell, all that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: comes into play just as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's kind of like the trifecta,
you know, it kind of needs to be all of
[SPEAKER_01]: the above, you know, cause if it's lacking
one or the other, then it really just
[SPEAKER_01]: makes it, you know, either a really nice
weed without a kick or really good looking
[SPEAKER_01]: pot that's got plenty of high,
but there's zero flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you kind of want all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well rounded.
[SPEAKER_03]: So talking on the topic of the skills,
Emerald Cut last few years has been
[SPEAKER_03]: dominated by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you got any special surprises or kind
of exciting releases in store for the
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerald Cup this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there, there's going to be,
I'll have my, my, uh, the white wine,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that line will be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the white Tahoe cookie times brandy
wine that shouldn't, that one will be
[SPEAKER_01]: ready by then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we're going to have a, the pine fruit,
which is a ghost OG, um, uh, purple vapor
[SPEAKER_01]: that should be ready to go by then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully my, uh, uh, the tangy wine
should be ready to go, um, which is that
[SPEAKER_01]: the citrus farmer brandy wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there, there'll be a few surprises.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm trying to, like I said,
I don't want to put anything out in a
[SPEAKER_01]: hurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to just release stuff that
that's, you know, that we know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, we'll pass the test of time as far as
popularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people enjoying what they're buying,
you know, I don't want people to,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, spend harder than money and
then not, not be impressed with what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're, what they're growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that sounds like a good little ethos
to have for yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Vinny, sorry, Vino OG, my apologies,
Vino OG, not very well known about
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely limited number of packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you be able to tell us a little bit
more about it and why you decided to work
[SPEAKER_03]: with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Vino is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if, if, if I take everything that
man has told me, uh, as, as truth,
[SPEAKER_01]: then what he's told me is he, he,
he knew some of the guys from,
[SPEAKER_01]: from cookie fam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so he knew Jiga or had, had been in
contact with him at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all from the Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I guess there was, um, the original
batch of seeds or whatever that came from
[SPEAKER_01]: those guys who had, you know, when they
made the Girl Scout cookies, there was
[SPEAKER_01]: certain seeds that were, you know,
handed out to some people, some were given
[SPEAKER_01]: out, you know, without any, you know,
colleges here, you go try these out,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was some people that grew them out
and found them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, OG KB came from that
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: The OG KB is from the original,
uh, cookies line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just another plant that popped up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that's something that's not,
I mean, some people don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another, um, apparently according
to, um, Mary Jane wines, the Vino OG cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: which he does have that cut alone,
uh, supposedly came from, uh, Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do you see that similarity yourself
or you just kind of taking the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the story on face value?
[SPEAKER_01]: Eh, a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growing it out myself, I only grew it
out the one time the pure Vino was grown
[SPEAKER_01]: out one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, I feel like it was,
um, there could be some cookies in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't, it wasn't, in my opinion,
it wasn't pure cookie form by any means,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a lot of stuff I found when growing,
um, um, stuff from the Girl Scout is you
[SPEAKER_01]: do, you do get Girl Scout cookie,
uh, obvious, um, domination in some,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the facts, but then there's,
um, there's some that come out that
[SPEAKER_01]: literally just have a completely different
thing going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think his one, the Vino obviously
means wine in Italian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that's the, what he was
going with was it's more of a,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, more of a, uh, kind of a Merlot type
of thing going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a definitely a sort of a,
uh, musky kind of a wine sort of smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so can we expect to see it appearing
in some of your crosses going forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, to be honest, probably, probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even have the cut anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, he, that's something that's,
that's his, I mean, I, I, I could get it
[SPEAKER_01]: back at any time and check it out again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, I've, I've got,
there's, it's almost to a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: When does it stop?
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point do you, do you, do you quit
with having so much stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, yeah, but there's, there's,
there's something that I would imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: there being, um, maybe down the line or
something from him, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, just, it's one of those things like I,
I'd like to probably use it down the line,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's just, there's just so many
freaking projects to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I don't even know how to get
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's just, where do I start?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I definitely have, um, you know,
a lot of plans in the works, but that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that one really isn't on the, uh,
on the to-do list right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally understandable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of, you know, talking about the
Emerald Cup, how do you feel about the
[SPEAKER_03]: quantity of cannabis cups we have these
days?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like there's a good amount?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like maybe we're a little
oversaturated and what's your favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, hands down, Emerald Cup is my favorite
go-to show right behind the high times
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the reason I like the high times
Michigan show so much is because other
[SPEAKER_01]: than when Colorado was still going on
that, that was, that was my favorite place
[SPEAKER_01]: to go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was, it was, I had such good
feedback from my strains there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people were interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all had heard of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always did really well when I did
those shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the same goes for Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I go there, I can go twice a
year in the same summer, um, two different
[SPEAKER_01]: times and do, do really well both times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are still, um, very welcoming
of me and, and, um, you know, really
[SPEAKER_01]: showing me a lot of love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Cup, obviously that is the,
it's your number one spot to go to just
[SPEAKER_01]: because of, uh, um, the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have everybody there is coming
to shop for their next season seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see people from every demographic,
but, but literally a ton of older people,
[SPEAKER_01]: older gentlemen walking with their wives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I I've even seen women that look like
they were sent down there by their,
[SPEAKER_01]: by their, their husband and her boyfriend.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they got their mud boots on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a, they've got like a basket
that they're just filling up with their
[SPEAKER_01]: seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're buying for the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, I get a kick out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, I've had conversations with,
with men in front of my booths.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just sitting there, jive into the
music for an hour while we all sit there
[SPEAKER_01]: and talk weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's just an awesome show to be at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do think that there can be,
I think a lot of people are kind of quick
[SPEAKER_01]: to jump on the, let's have a cannabis cup
and we'll just make a ton of money off
[SPEAKER_01]: these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the funny part about it is you'll
have these people that say they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: put on these shows, they'll, they'll
supposedly buy this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to get everything going.
[SPEAKER_01]: They buy permits, they do whatever,
and then come to find out that,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not even allowed to have the show
in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just paid them money and then
they'll want to have us hold a credit or
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll want to pay us back later in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you guys took all of our money
and didn't even know if you're having a
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's been a case.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had that happen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, I've seen it happen with even some
of these big companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, yeah, it's, it's, it's crazy,
but no, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that, I think it's good to have
shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there's a certain amount
that, that, that, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's too many, um, they've actually
been shutting them down left and right
[SPEAKER_01]: because it just doesn't go with the
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're just not supposed to be
public consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you're not supposed to be sales of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you end up having a lot of people
that were using these shows as basically a
[SPEAKER_01]: table to just sell their, their product
from that's no longer allowed in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these places.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last show I was at in June,
um, for high times for the NorCal show,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was an empty, it was totally empty
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you, you're used to seeing so many,
so many booths everywhere popping up and
[SPEAKER_01]: less and less people are able to attend
because they're not licensed up yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not, they don't have the proper
paperwork and they, therefore they can't
[SPEAKER_01]: sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where do you see the overall industry
heading over the next five years?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think that large scale
legalization is going to occur and
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially ruin things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I think it kind of goes, I think
there's good that's coming from it because
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, everything in life is
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's steady change coming with
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we all agree with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily, but is it good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because it's also given us an
opportunity to not just be a guy who's,
[SPEAKER_01]: who claim, I have a company, but it's not
necessarily a legal company, but I kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: make money off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm involved in
something where I'm paying my taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I have a full legitimate business out
of this and it's something I want to see
[SPEAKER_01]: myself grow more and more with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, that the, the,
the theme of cannabis cups might get
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller as far as just a huge group of
people selling pot out of a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're different booths and doing that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that those are fun and I think
it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be a part of it, but I think
they'll get smaller and smaller as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: having more of a kind of an underground
network of cups where it's more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: private scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's where it all started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it was, it was more of a smaller
scene of people turned in their buds and
[SPEAKER_01]: those people would judge the cannabis
based on what we were seeing right there
[SPEAKER_01]: at face value, not some judges behind a
closed door and then given the award to
[SPEAKER_01]: the most, you know, the, the, the biggest,
highest paying vendor, which seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know, man, it's, it's,
it's good and bad, but I think that the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall legalization is going to draw us
to more shows that are more like the canna
[SPEAKER_01]: con and more of like convention style
where there's no smoking, there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: vending of any cannabis products,
but more or less shaking hands and using
[SPEAKER_01]: it as a tool of network, your brand and
really, you know, meet and greet and kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of get people turned on.
[SPEAKER_01]: To what you have to offer, but all of that
stuff is going to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting things out of your local
dispensaries or out of the different rec
[SPEAKER_01]: stores that are available in your state.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully dungeons of all genetics
will be something that you can find in
[SPEAKER_01]: every state that's going to legalize and
ones that already have, you're slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing more and more of my strains pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in the long run here,
um, it will get to a point where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to, you will start seeing brands
just like you do Nestle and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: other, you know, chocolate companies and
big, you know, tobacco and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different people you are familiar with
those brands and you'll start seeing them
[SPEAKER_01]: in every state and you'll start seeing
that with these cannabis brands as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's good, but overall,
as long as the right people are running it
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're still letting us get a piece
of the pie and we're able to operate like
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been doing and have a good thing
going, then there's nothing to complain
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was super against legalization at first,
you know, but now, I mean, how convenient,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you don't have any weed and
you're not growing it at the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can really go right down the street
and go pick from a hundred different
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's kind of what we always
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted, but there's still a few things
that come into play that kind of make it a
[SPEAKER_01]: negative experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's really, I mean, everyone's
got their opinion, but I'm kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not on the fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more towards legalization more,
um, for the, you know, the, the movement
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're heading in, but at the same
time, I can't forget my past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, you know, either black
market or being involved in the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: scene where we could pretty much do
whatever we wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you had, you were falling into
that gray area, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that brings us to the last little
section of the show where we've got a
[SPEAKER_03]: quick fire questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So last little few certainly don't take as
long to answer, hopefully, but usually
[SPEAKER_03]: people stress out about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first one, what is your favorite strain
of weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, no, no hands down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I'll say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did gelato 33 gelato, 41, which is
there's a, there's a company here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington state called Kana organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do all, um, greenhouse grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and their gelato is some of the,
I absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, and that's another thing that's
weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington state, we have very few people
that are actually producing the strange
[SPEAKER_01]: gelato in the rec scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're one of the only people I've seen
to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and there's a couple other guys that
have gelatos, but this one in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: is the number 41 cut and it is,
it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smoke whenever I can find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I go down to California, I can get
access to the 45.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get the 30 all these any,
anything gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems like it has such a good nose
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like the Sherbert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think, I think Mike has mentioned
exotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mike has mentioned the Sherb is one of his
favorite strains because of the creaminess
[SPEAKER_01]: and the, it's just got everything he loves
in his cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Sherb is another one up there
that's got amazing things going for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out cookie fam for making some of
our favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our favorite strains that we love to,
uh, smoke and then crossbreed with,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's, there's a lot of great other
ones that, that have been gone for a while
[SPEAKER_01]: that I haven't seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for instance, the blue cheese that I
don't know who, who, I don't know which
[SPEAKER_01]: cut, I don't know who had it, which one
who made it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was a blue cheese that was going
around for a while and I absolutely love
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I missed that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I crazy, but for right now I'm,
I'm smoking on, I love the gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the flip side, what is the worst
strain you've ever had?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or just the one that least drives with
you, man, blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just joking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, honestly, I don't, uh, man,
there's, I don't even, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: because just like, just like the
experience, if it wasn't good,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, into the, into the, uh,
not necessarily into the trash bin,
[SPEAKER_01]: but definitely into the trash jar that
gets passed to someone who doesn't mind
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking anything that's handed to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if I didn't like it, it's,
it's, it's not something I'm going to hold
[SPEAKER_01]: onto very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I don't know, man, it's hard off
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I just smoke recently that I
didn't like?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was something that was given to me
at the Michigan cup that I was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, that was fucking garbage,
but I don't, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what strain it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm definitely not going to mention it
if I did, because that's just kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: it could have been a bad example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to sit there and say that the
strain sucks just cause of the example I
[SPEAKER_01]: got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not really fair, but I've had
my fair share of bad weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll let you say the worst thing I've
ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That what I started this interview off
with was some of that brown sticks and
[SPEAKER_01]: stems, uh, weed that swag from,
uh, Mexico.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is a strain that kind of asked
this one earlier in the interview,
[SPEAKER_03]: but a strain that you no longer have
access to, but you did in the past that
[SPEAKER_01]: you wish you had back hands down,
super fruit from captain Crip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't, I, I, I was very,
uh, I was a big smoker back when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to that guy, 2003, 2004,
I came from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew what good weed was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and literally I, I, I, if anybody out
there listening has access to super food
[SPEAKER_01]: or any of the crosses that guy made hit me
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that literally to this day,
like, I don't know what it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: just the smell and overall, like,
I, I feel like I'm, I almost remember
[SPEAKER_01]: getting green sick, but I, it could have
been from something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't from just smoking his weed,
but I mean, it was awesome weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was just, I got so baked combined
with something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I threw up that day, but
regardless, it was, uh, it was just good
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really, I think he had, he had
something really special there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I, I had the clone at one point and
I lost it cause I was young and dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, if literally, if I could get
anything back to that one would probably
[SPEAKER_01]: be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, alongside that 2003, 2004,
I was getting a strain called,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, Northern lights skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's a, that's a pretty
typical cross from the Dutch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I mean, you can get Northern
lights, skunk haze is everywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the specific combination of that
Northern lights skunk haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the, the specific phenol that
this guy had found was it, it put it
[SPEAKER_01]: before we use the word loud, like,
Oh, this strain is loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy just, it was absolute.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could not cruise around with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be in your car and you'd be white
knuckle driving with driving 30,
[SPEAKER_01]: 35 and as slow as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't get pulled over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was, if you get pulled over
with that weed, there's your, it's being
[SPEAKER_01]: found no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's just, there's just certain ones
that are just killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that definitely was, that was one I
miss and then really wish I could get
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you could go back to any time in
history, any place to collect some seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: where would you go and what seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, probably just because I'm a big
Indica fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if, I mean, as long as I was
accepted, I knew I was going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: kidnapped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably somewhere in the Hindu Kush
mountain range, collecting seeds straight
[SPEAKER_01]: off plants out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, something about Hindu Kush,
I had it, I had it a few times back in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I don't, I'm not sure if that
was pure or real by any means,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if, if I knew for certain that I was,
I was in the Kush mountain ranges and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was able to get a pure Hindu or something
similar to that, that I could bring back
[SPEAKER_01]: and smoke on, I'd be pretty, pretty pumped
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, again, I mean, all the other ones
that people have grown and crossbred and
[SPEAKER_01]: made from, you know, from back then until
now, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, there's, there's a lot of
stuff that I've probably come across.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really didn't know the smell of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could probably, I'd love to see again,
but that one for sure is something just a
[SPEAKER_01]: pure, just a real pure Kush that I knew
that it's as pure as it can get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice humble little answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what the final, oh no, second last
little quick question.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the next little breeding project
you're doing that people should be getting
[SPEAKER_03]: excited for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, there's too much, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think probably a lot of people
have been excited about this lemon grove,
[SPEAKER_01]: this, this, this lemon tree times citrus
farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be something that,
that provides, like I mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: just something different than your typical
tangy orange citrus strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to have a nice combo.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lemon tree is one of those ones that
ever since I first smoked it and excuse me
[SPEAKER_01]: if I'm wrong, but from what I get from it,
I believe it's a lemon sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, some sort of mix up with that or a,
uh, bag seed from it, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be wrong, but if I remember what
reading it was something had to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon sour diesel and the LSD from when I
used to get it was, it was such an
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible flavor and, and it was just,
it was really, it was totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't, it was there's citrus,
but it was different all the way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what I'm hoping for that I
get out of this strain is that we find
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be, it's not necessarily
the exact same thing, but just something
[SPEAKER_01]: that brings just ultimate flavor and has,
uh, a real kick-ass, uh, kind of a lemon,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, orange kind of combination going on
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So final question, where can people grab
your gear?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you gotta, you gotta find the one you
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's some people I found of
they, they're very loyal to their,
[SPEAKER_01]: to their banks that they order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people it's because of credit card
processing or whatever they, the freebies
[SPEAKER_01]: they get, but, um, S O L seeds,
Neptune seed bank, Oregon elite seeds.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these different guys who are carrying
my gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: All are great people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've met every single one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, they all stand behind their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's some other ones that are a
little bit smaller banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in Michigan state, um,
Great Lake seed bank seed seller.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really just walk in off the street
and go have your options met with almost
[SPEAKER_01]: every bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, almost every seed you could find
in the other banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, other than that, come catch me at a
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's, that'd be the way,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Direct from the horse's mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you have any shout outs or any
comments you'd like to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, man, yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a shout out to all my guys,
every, everyone out there that's helping
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, test out my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those that are growing it, the ones that
actually come through with what they say
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to do more recently than
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's a guy named bonfire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nate, that guy went above and beyond to,
to not only grow the seeds out,
[SPEAKER_01]: have them tested for, for THC CBD and,
uh, terpings, but also then had cards made
[SPEAKER_01]: to display at a shop that had the picture
of the, uh, the weed and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just listed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's very, very few times you
get a touch that goes above and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: spend his own money.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make things look even better than he
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, other than that, um, the names I've
mentioned that helped me put me in the
[SPEAKER_01]: position I'm in now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, thank you to everyone and anyone
who supports me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks again so much for taking the
time to sit down and share all the
[SPEAKER_04]: knowledge with us.
