[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back to part two of our chat with
Todd McCormick of AG Seedco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're excited to get back into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of that joint, you're obviously
aware you're quite lucky to be smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: original haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not many people are able to say they've
had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the question is, how would you
describe it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you describe the effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the flavors you get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's the sort of thing that's
for everyone or it's only for a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: type of smoker?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if more people had access to it,
they would really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's spicy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an incense almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really sweet, but it has sweet
tones.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high is really energetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The part I like about it is if I smoke
haze in the morning, it really invigorates
[SPEAKER_02]: me to want to go do the dishes,
get to work, jump on my tasks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know what it is because
I've tested it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tested haze and tested OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have thought the OG Kush was more
potent than the haze, but the OG Kush that
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew that time I think came back like
21.66.
[SPEAKER_02]: The haze that I tested was at like 24.9.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were growing same soil, same system,
same everything all by me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just the THC in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something in the synergy of the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The terpenes play this really important
role.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunkman Sam uses a really good analogy
that when you get high, it's like getting
[SPEAKER_02]: into an airplane.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get into that airplane,
the cannabinoids are the engines that
[SPEAKER_02]: bring you up to your height.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the terpenes are the rudders that
will shape the flow of it, the softness of
[SPEAKER_02]: your landing, the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without the terpenes, the cannabinoids
don't really feel as good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody listening to this can actually try
it themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They literally could take a good bud,
smoke half of it, leave it on the coffee
[SPEAKER_02]: table for a couple of days, let it dry up.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the cannabinoids are still present,
but the terpenes will have been lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the terpenes are lost, it won't have
the same high, it won't have the same
[SPEAKER_02]: taste, it won't have the same flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changes even though all the
cannabinoids are still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it really shows that there's this
true importance when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_02]: synergy between the terpenes and the
modulation that they create with the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I urge more people, especially the ones
that buy my seeds, to start selecting on
[SPEAKER_02]: organoleptic testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rather than analytical testing,
because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: the machine's not the one buying the
wheat, it's the human.
[SPEAKER_02]: If something doesn't really have that
allure to it, you're going to pass on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that a lot of breeders are going
to find out that the market's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: drive the product towards the quality that
the market can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be about effect more than
it's about bag appeal or anything else,
[SPEAKER_02]: or about more than a name, more than
anything When I started selling pop when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was 12, everybody would always ask me,
what's it like?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this one like?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little different to everybody,
but the haze is really not narcotic,
[SPEAKER_02]: more spacey, more of that you get high,
you get high, and you get high some more,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you get forgetful, and you get giddy,
and you're looking for the ice cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's the fun high.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Northern Lights is more heavy,
more light.
[SPEAKER_02]: More go sit in the hot tub, and grab the
remote control, and relax, or go to bed
[SPEAKER_02]: early.
[SPEAKER_02]: That more narcotic effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The haze to me is, I think more people are
going to love it, and I think more people
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've sold quite a few seeds in the last
two and a half years of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping more and more and more people
start introducing it into their crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been long enough now, about two
seasons, since I offered it in 2019,
[SPEAKER_02]: that people have been able to now grow it
and work with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally think we're going to start
seeing more and more of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My joke when I started doing this was,
I want to haze the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool to see for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that I noticed about the photos
you'd posted on your Instagram was that
[SPEAKER_01]: the buds were a lot more plump,
and I guess just fatter than I was
[SPEAKER_01]: expecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in a lot of people's minds,
like myself, you imagine you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get one tiny, piddly little joint per
branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the question arises, do you think
maybe it yields more than what people
[SPEAKER_01]: expect, or it is very much like what?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually hesitated to post all the
variations of photos I was getting from
[SPEAKER_02]: the variety, because some of them look so
unlike what people think haze is.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get set in their mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an old quote that I used to write
into all of the Emperor Wears No Clothes
[SPEAKER_02]: books that I used to give away,
and there's hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was by Daniel Borenstein.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quote is, the greatest obstacle to
discovery is not ignorance, it is the
[SPEAKER_02]: illusion of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to write that in all the books,
because I felt it summarized the message
[SPEAKER_02]: we were putting out about cannabis being
enshrouded in lies that only the noble
[SPEAKER_02]: could see.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the whole mission of The Emperor
Wears No Clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those people listening, the book was
named The Emperor Wears No Clothes from
[SPEAKER_02]: the fable The Emperor's New Clothes,
where the emperor was sold cloth that only
[SPEAKER_02]: the noble could see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack felt that cannabis was enshrouded in
lies that only the noble could see,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he named the book The Emperor Wears No
Clothes, because anyone who looked at this
[SPEAKER_02]: would see that it really wasn't what they
pertained it to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: That said,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel as if a lot of people have these
pre-existing notions about original haze,
[SPEAKER_02]: and because they haven't had experience
with the variety, only hybrids of the
[SPEAKER_02]: variety for the most part, they really
don't know what it's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say to people that original haze and
skunk one are polar opposites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunk one is a relatively true breeding,
super uniform, super consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Original hayseeds are like inbred,
F God knows what at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked Sam, he's like, who knows,
F11, who knows how many generations of
[SPEAKER_02]: times he's bred them together,
but he was doing so because he wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: maintain the variety within the variety so
that he could come through it
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotype-wise and pick things to work
with, which makes pure sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I grow them out, I've found
phenotypes that go from literally eight,
[SPEAKER_02]: nine weeks that are, I would say,
mid-leaflet, but again, I grow in a
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse, so I grow fairly big plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I posted some Norton Lights leaves that
were so gigantic, biggest I've ever seen
[SPEAKER_02]: in all my years growing on this last run
with Norton Lights number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was also the one that morphed into
looking like duck's foot, but the more I
[SPEAKER_02]: research it, duck's foot has a narrower,
more like, dare I say, sativa,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I hate to, but a more narrow leaflet,
and this one was just plain fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the hayseed itself has a lot of
variation, and you get everything from
[SPEAKER_02]: these 16-week, narrow, narrow,
narrow leaflet, very few florets on the
[SPEAKER_02]: stem to stuff that's pretty beefy.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the females out of the entire
greenhouse turned purple, and it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: because it was cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: My greenhouse is completely
environmentally controlled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, damn, and I had Rob Clark
here visiting during the harvest,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he was down there taking photos and
just enjoying the shit out of it because
[SPEAKER_02]: he went to University Santa Cruz in the
70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to trim in the 80s when he was in
college.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's closer to this than any of us,
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't doubt he had his hands in making
the seeds that I was given because he
[SPEAKER_02]: worked at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was in charge of the greenhouses,
so he knew exactly what I was growing
[SPEAKER_02]: because I don't doubt he made the seeds
with Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just having a blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he saw the purple one, he was the one
that was like, oh, people used to love
[SPEAKER_02]: this one because it had a silvery,
purpleish to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see color expressions in them start to
come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had Mishka here who used to be Neville's
girlfriend a little bit, and she was
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting at my desk, and we were talking
about the origin of haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told her straight up, I said,
it's not with Neville, it's with Santa
[SPEAKER_02]: Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I says, come downstairs and touch these
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were not in flower at the time,
and you tell me what they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and Mishka went downstairs,
and she touched the plants, and she
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately smelled them and went,
oh, yeah, yeah, that's haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, right, I got these from the
same person Neville did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any surprise?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I guess Sensei named a variety
that has haze in it after Mishka in the
[SPEAKER_02]: last few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what she was wondering about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: She gave me a pre-copy of a book before it
was released, and it has the interview at
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting because in the interview,
Neville isn't listening to himself because
[SPEAKER_02]: in it he says that you couldn't improve
haze by breeding it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Sam told him.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way Sam would know that you can't
improve it by breeding it together is if
[SPEAKER_02]: he did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When Neville was talking about these seeds
from 1969, the original seeds that I have
[SPEAKER_02]: are from that 1969 cross that Sam kept
isolated from all his other work and
[SPEAKER_02]: reproduced as that 69 cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seed or the plants, I believe that
Neville was given to male plants in 1987,
[SPEAKER_02]: those came from these original haze seeds
from one of those generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds I got from Sam were also from
that IBL preservation and are basically
[SPEAKER_02]: brothers and sisters, cousins of those
original seeds that go all the way back.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are what they are, if that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I find unique about the original
seeds and the original hazes out of
[SPEAKER_02]: everything in my collection, they are the
only seeds that I have that have no Afghan
[SPEAKER_02]: influence in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really interesting point to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touch on the broader topic of the
genetics within the strains we discuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long time, I used to hear people
talk about haze as though it wasn't until
[SPEAKER_01]: the tie was crossed into it at the end
that it truly became haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in more recent discussions with
people in the know, I realized that
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously wasn't quite correct because a
lot of people talk about haze as the real
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombian rich psychedelic high that those
cultivars bring to it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what I'm wondering is,
at what point did you think it was haze?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the commonly discussed Indian
genetics are actually in there at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, what are your thoughts on the
different phenos?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just referenced the blue, the silver,
the purple, were they real things or was
[SPEAKER_01]: it just potluck?
[SPEAKER_02]: According to Skunkman Sam, the original
haze was a three-way Colombian combination
[SPEAKER_02]: that was based around three different ...
There was panterosa, which meant red,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there was a silver and I think a
blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suck for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm stoned right now, but I've asked him a
zillion times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same damn question, tells me the same damn
answer every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a three-way Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single year, what kind of ruined
haze?
[SPEAKER_02]: By the mid-70s, they had out-crossed that
1969 first hybrid so many times that it
[SPEAKER_02]: really wasn't hazy anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a Mexican cross with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had Thai cross with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single year was a different
out-cross because they were trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: improve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: By 76, 77, according to Skunkman Sam,
they gave up growing it because he
[SPEAKER_02]: introduced Skunk One, which was two-thirds
tropical, one-third Afghan, Colombian
[SPEAKER_02]: Golden Acapulco Gold, but it was coming
down late August, early September and it
[SPEAKER_02]: changed the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a commercial cropper,
you got to wait until November,
[SPEAKER_02]: December to get down what you could be
pulling down at the beginning of
[SPEAKER_02]: September, same location.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no question.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't want to expose themselves to
get busted and they started switching over
[SPEAKER_02]: to this amazing fucking weed that was
Skunkman Sam's.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, they stopped growing haze and
by the late 70s, haze was nothing but a
[SPEAKER_02]: legend on a lot of levels and the genetics
were all but lost, even by the people who
[SPEAKER_02]: originally held them because they didn't
preserve them like Sam did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had another question sort of similar,
but I think you sort of answered it
[SPEAKER_01]: already where I was going to ask you about
the photos we see on your Instagram where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like haze crossed to Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I was sort of wondering like,
is that an extra Thai cross or sounds like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the first one?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a Thai cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Skunk's, Skunk Hayes Thai.
[SPEAKER_02]: He calls it thunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thai Hayes Skunk calls thunk, but I'm not
growing that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have grown that in, I think I grew it
like 2014 or 2015.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was very generous back in 2012 and he
sent me home with enough to play with for
[SPEAKER_02]: a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the first few years, I would just
grow some of the seeds and just do fennel
[SPEAKER_02]: hunts and then save a plant and throw the
rest away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't really until I started AGCCO
that I considered IBLing them and trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring them back to the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't feel like it was my variety to do
that with, especially after the story he
[SPEAKER_02]: told me about how he viewed his
relationship with Neville and why Neville
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't have all the seeds of Hayes and
Neville made up the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of made sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I didn't want to be that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't, and so, but I think that
trying to get these out to the world is a
[SPEAKER_02]: good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, trying to,
you know, save these and spread these
[SPEAKER_02]: around is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sam himself did too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for, I would say late,
late eighties, early nineties,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was still selling seeds by the kilo,
probably to a lot of the Dutch breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by that time the green team,
which was, which was Wernard and
[SPEAKER_02]: Positronix, which became Positronix.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was, Wernard was clearly, you know,
knocking off remaking F2ing, F3ing,
[SPEAKER_02]: F4ing, everything that he had ever got
from Sam, which was quite a bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: He got the whole collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's clear to me that Wernard and the
green team, Wernard had Hayes before
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wernard had Hayes probably right from 85
onward, but had very little interest in
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it was, again, you know,
his favorite variety was something called
[SPEAKER_02]: Citral, which I would, it was like a
little bit, it took a little longer than
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe B52, which at the time was like a
Chronic, which was like a, a big bud,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a, like a super skunk time super
cropper type thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't my favorite, but you know,
Wernard was looking for stuff that fit
[SPEAKER_02]: what he was trying to do, which was,
you know, promoting door cultivation and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a lot of little lollipop plants
and, you know, and I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the first time I walked into
Positronix as a, and saw all those little
[SPEAKER_02]: plants in the perfect little, you know,
square meters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I, I immediately thought to
myself, oh, that's how you're supposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my life was never the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never grew, I never grew the same after
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I realized how efficient it was to
grow smaller plants that had less veg
[SPEAKER_02]: time, I was no going back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, so that's also why I got
busted with so many plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a picture of me standing
in front of a wall of clones on the back
[SPEAKER_02]: of my book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got busted, I think with like 4,100
plants, whatever, at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just because I, you know,
see green, it's the most efficient way to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I think that these tropical
equatorials have come back to,
[SPEAKER_02]: because one of the tips Neville gave me
and my friend Tom was, don't give it any
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have plants that take over 10,
11 weeks to finish flowering, move them
[SPEAKER_02]: straight from rooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Into flowering and allow them to grow and
flower simultaneously, because even though
[SPEAKER_02]: they're in flower, they will, they will
grow continually as they're flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll still get plants that are
almost a meter tall after 11 weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: if not taller, even though they started
off, you know, you know, barely a few
[SPEAKER_02]: centimeters tall in comparison to where
they ended up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was good advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still pass that along to people to
this day, because if you take a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: equatorial tropicals and put them in when
they're, you know, just a day or two after
[SPEAKER_02]: rooting and pop them next to each other,
you can get fantastic harvest,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 20 plus grams per plant,
you know, in a tight, close grouping that
[SPEAKER_02]: way exceeds what you would get from,
you know, six weeks of grow and letting it
[SPEAKER_02]: go up and then having a bunch of wasted
space at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, some solid advice there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess just to quickly wrap up the haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, there's obviously no
notable haze cuts that go around,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there are a few NL5 hazes that have
got a bit of a reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I was wondering if you had tried
any of the notable ones like the A5,
[SPEAKER_01]: the C5, or even like the Cuban black haze
by any chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuban haze I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's NL5.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you look at the dating of
it, I believe that late 80s, early 90s,
[SPEAKER_02]: NL5 was a hugely popular variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that a lot of people were growing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the others tend to disappoint
a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Cali Mist a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, but you know, it was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was having a conversation with Simon
once and he didn't think that the lung
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering female that he used in the
original combination was haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, what did you think it
was?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said Colombian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went, well, I think it is haze,
you know, like, but you know, it just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's interesting how the names change and
people don't really realize what they have
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though they're using it
successfully, and you know, I think haze
[SPEAKER_02]: has been amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my two favorite haze plants when I
lived in Amsterdam was NL5 haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville's haze wasn't out yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or he just started to release it actually
at the Tolstrat Greenhouse, if I remember
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Cali Mist, you know, I liked Neville's
haze though over NL5.
[SPEAKER_02]: NL5 by haze was great, but it was more
normal lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he crossed it, when he crossed the
NL5 by haze back to that haze,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it made it spicier, made it more
hazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I liked it better, yielded less.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it took, I think a little longer,
but it was worth the wait and worth the
[SPEAKER_02]: loss of yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think we'll ever see Neville's haze
make a comeback?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something which is really always
popular among the heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of stuff close.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's funny because like I have
the genetics, it's like bacon brownies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it comes to selecting the proper
salt and the proper sugar and the proper
[SPEAKER_02]: molasses, the proper wheat, you know,
to make your cookie just the way you
[SPEAKER_02]: remember it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that this is similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, we can't go back and smell
those phenotypes that he had.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for those of us that have been around
the genetics, I mean, we can test the
[SPEAKER_02]: prodigy and see if it reminds us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, for me, I mean,
I already have a lot of those hazy
[SPEAKER_02]: combinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the stuff I'm smoking would remind
you or anybody who wasn't familiar with
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh, that this is that haze because
it's overwhelms the gassiness of the NL
[SPEAKER_02]: with the spicy overtones of the haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like if you came over, I think you
would be in haze heaven over here because
[SPEAKER_02]: I've touched it to damn near everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that I'm growing the NL,
I have a lot of stuff that has not been
[SPEAKER_02]: touched to the NL.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's been hard to resist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing a room for my head and I was
in the middle of flowering, meaning I was
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a room for my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing a room seedless because I only
use one meal at a time at my facility
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm not trying to fuck around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had the NL2 going in the greenhouse
and I took a branch of it and I brought it
[SPEAKER_02]: into the room that I was going to do
seedless and shook it over the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because even though I had original
haze going and I had these skunk haze
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses I had going and I had these super
glue, I crossed it with on haze and then
[SPEAKER_02]: did a selection, crossed that selection to
original haze to try to pump up the haze
[SPEAKER_02]: again, kind of going for that Neville haze
vibe, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it, but then I just hit it with
the NL2 because now I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was like, frig it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of getting the sense immediately,
I'll just get to play with the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: because the NL2 is so impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to see what the effects are
with this male against a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: other genetics that I'm so familiar with
to see how it dominates the prodigy that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes off of it and how it affects it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of sense I get, what kind of
body I get from the buds, what kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: width I get from the leaves and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just did a combination of original
haze as the female crossed with NL2 as the
[SPEAKER_02]: male in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hanging up right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because I keep going down
there and I just can't, I go downstairs
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes just to go to the haze plant to
just smell them because you get an upper
[SPEAKER_02]: from smelling them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I get happy just smelling the fucking
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's that unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know, the skunks sitting
down there smell sweet, the supergales
[SPEAKER_02]: smell gassy, but that haze just,
I don't know, it calls my name.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's special.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be a neat
combination because the genetics are
[SPEAKER_02]: dissimilar and we'll see how it comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's kind of close to what Neville was
doing back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the NL, depending on which,
but I think he used the NL2 a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think NL did, cause it was the one that
was spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just did the opposite of what he
did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of a NL5 female crossed with the
haze male, I went with the original haze
[SPEAKER_02]: female and also with the NL2 male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to start seeing how some of
these things pop up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I already like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the super glue by on haze was on
the cover of grow magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the people that's grown it love
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it has that Afghan, but it has that
spice.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, can you give us a little bit
of a rundown on the different smells and
[SPEAKER_01]: effects from the different NL lines you
have?
[SPEAKER_02]: The pierced indica is heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The NL2 is heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The NL5 is a little more light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning like when I say light,
like from more tropical plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: I get more of a, like a, I don't know,
like a light high, I don't know how to put
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's more in your head and you're
just kind of like happy high.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the stuff like the NL is more
physically relaxing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My neck pain recedes more, but I can't say
that the haze doesn't make my neck pain go
[SPEAKER_02]: away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that it gets so high I forget
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the NL feels like it actually like,
I don't forget about it, but I feel kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's the, you know,
the night quilt compared to caffeine
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would consider haze is more like in my
body acts as a caffeine and the NLs,
[SPEAKER_02]: the purest indica is just very resiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's when I broke up the buds,
my fingers smell like import hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you've ever been to Hampshire and
you smoke like King Hassan hash and shit
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, like it, it just, like,
it just had, it smells like hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It like smells like old school hash and I
love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the flowers smell kind of skunky,
stinky when they were growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: which reminds me of the eighties too,
because you know, that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what it kind of smelled like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the, when it would cure,
it would, it would depend on when you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, depending on how fresh the
flowers were working, it depend on how
[SPEAKER_02]: much of the terpenes they were emitting at
any given time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were getting pot from your
friend who was throwing it in their
[SPEAKER_02]: closet, they probably weren't waiting that
long for the dry and the cure,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we were also excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were actually getting cannabis was
probably two or three weeks from being cut
[SPEAKER_02]: down a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you smell it, it was so
overwhelming and so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but now with the legal market,
we get pots that's like fucking months
[SPEAKER_02]: old.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like cured and dried and wasn't even
handled well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, like it's unbelievable
and it's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just think I'm not the best at
describing flavors and tastes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And stuff, but more of the highs and the
excitement I get from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like the Northern Lights and I like
feeling relaxed, but I like the hazes and
[SPEAKER_02]: I like feeling creative too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, they sound fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm more of a haze guy than a kush
guy, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a follow-up question to that,
can we ever expect to maybe see any
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized work from you or specifically
S1s of any of these lines, the NLs or the
[SPEAKER_01]: pure syndicates?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plans in my future are to start
collecting a lot of these clone-only
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars that are floating around,
you know, and S1ing them so other people
[SPEAKER_02]: can experience green crack and train wreck
and other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mel Frank already does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He not only makes S1s, he's been breeding
with female pollen for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he makes crosses by, so he'll take his
females that he likes and then he'll
[SPEAKER_02]: reverse them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He will collect the pollen, he will store
the pollen, and then he will administer
[SPEAKER_02]: that pollen on another plant that he likes
and he will do femid, feminized breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, but he's, I mean,
this is Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I expect him to be a little ahead
of the curve when it comes to what he
[SPEAKER_02]: does.
[SPEAKER_02]: First time he showed me something,
it was S1, F1, and S1, F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went, no, this isn't how it could
be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, well, I don't know what else
you'd call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I collected the pollen from one plant and
I bred it to the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, oh, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, and that's why the name's
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, well, I put the plant that I
collect, the female plant that I collected
[SPEAKER_02]: the pollen from as the second name,
because it would be the male, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, and it was the second
time I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think I should call it
other than an F2?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you pop those seeds,
you bred those seeds together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got like, dealing with him is so
much fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the first person in his whole life
that he's allowed to sell the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of an honor to say the very
least.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learn something from him every time
we talk, which is fortunately,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, quite often.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's been releasing, I've had S1 seeds
of his since I've been selling seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: because he's had them for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have the bread, feminized bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's still doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's making more feminized GDP seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't keep them in stock last time he
gave them to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm expecting more soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then what I'm also going to do is the
guy that's famous for GDP, actually gave
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds to him back some years back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know the guy, myself, his name's
Ken.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to try to get the cutting
that's been floating around of GDP and
[SPEAKER_02]: then S1 that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of plants that are on our
hit list to kind of collect an S1,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think they're great breeding
material and people deserve a right to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to cross them with
something, because I want them to be as
[SPEAKER_02]: close to what they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only way I can put them in a seed
form is to S1 them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seed varieties that I got from Scunk
Man Sam that I can't reproduce,
[SPEAKER_02]: like Thunk, Taihei Scunk, I'm just going
to go through my seeds, do selections,
[SPEAKER_02]: pick the best examples, and then S1 those
so that people can experience those as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked him if I could do that,
and he was totally cool with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't know another way of
releasing proper representations of them
[SPEAKER_02]: except to S1 them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at this rate, with the seed
collection I have and the plans I have,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only hope to have three more
lifetimes, at least, maybe, if I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watching the grass grow, that's all I want
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stand around, work, and watch the grass
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like you've got a lot of
exciting breeding projects sort of in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, which one are you most
excited for and are going to start next?
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't started yet, but it's going to
be the next one to get the wheels
[SPEAKER_01]: churning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, breeding projects are going to
supersede me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like I'm breeding when I'm
f2ing through permission some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: original haze or the skunk or the northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really feel that's breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel it's preserving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm grateful I'm part of the
preservation of these genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm passing them on to other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do that again with NL5
because I ran out of NL5 seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's freaking out over them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm going to do it with the purist
indica because Greg really wants to see
[SPEAKER_02]: more people get purist indica and
experience the medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the best afghan I've ever grown
in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think people deserve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like leathery leaves and just
crusty crusty buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in love with how it smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in love with how it smells after it
dries.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, my goal was actually to spend
more time going through more hay seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: selecting more phenotypes of haze and
spending more time with these because all
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds that Greg sent me I've cloned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have all those genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to just spend more time going
through all of the different sister
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypes and really getting to know them
for their differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I really want to spend more time
breeding together with original haze
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think the real key to F1s is
dissimilar genetics if you really want to
[SPEAKER_02]: get some fantastic hybridization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm trying to do what everybody
else isn't doing, which is breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: together closely related plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have that unique opportunity to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not trying to be a jerk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to give the opportunity to
other people so that they can also
[SPEAKER_02]: experience these genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's a lot of artists in
the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wrote in Neville's article.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw him as an artist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though he didn't invent red,
blue, gold, what he created with it was
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can appreciate his art.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't mean other people can't
come along with the primary colors and
[SPEAKER_02]: recreate similar combinations that maybe
are even more spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to change topic for a
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was curious to know, how was it that you
came about to be the editor of The Emperor
[SPEAKER_01]: Wears No Clothes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have a close relationship with
Jack before that, or was that the start of
[SPEAKER_01]: the relationship?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was 1993, and I'd read his book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was living in San Diego in a place
called Pacific Beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the book really blew me away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reinforced a lot of the decisions I'd
made for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have hippie guilt about being a
pothead and kept it secret, like I was
[SPEAKER_02]: less than someone and less than society
and frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I read his book, it was like
liberation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I called the number on the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was January of 1994.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this girl named Summer answered the
phone and started explaining to me that
[SPEAKER_02]: they were doing an initiative to legalize
marijuana in camp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I should come up and help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was stunned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to maybe go say hi to him,
buy him lunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had good money at the time, so I could
afford to go buy him lunch in LA or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hoped to just say thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I got there, I saw what they were
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was sitting there one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was literally the first day I got
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Jack walked in the office.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, who the fuck are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, who the fuck are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, I'm Jack Heron.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you even wondering?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, what are you from the East Coast?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, you want to smoke the best
goddamn pot you've ever smoked in your
[SPEAKER_02]: life?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a cannabis collection at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a duffel bag full of different
eights and quarters, maybe 20 to 30 of
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the headphones died.
[SPEAKER_02]: One minute, let me get my headphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another set of headphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I followed him in a group of hippies into
the back room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sat down and he showed me this
really great pot, probably a Hindu Kush
[SPEAKER_02]: grown in Northern California by a
gentleman named Richard Davis,
[SPEAKER_02]: who owned the Traveling Hemp Museum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I started pulling out all these
different types of weed that someone would
[SPEAKER_02]: stick to the baggie and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jack is a real pothead.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wanted to smoke all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wasn't going to let me out of his sight
till he smoked all my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we sat there getting high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he brought me over to his place
because he was like, you're not driving
[SPEAKER_02]: back to San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, don't go get a hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can crash at my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a couch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to his place and he whipped out
the Bible, bro, and starts teaching me
[SPEAKER_02]: about the etymology of letters and words
and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is what he was tripping on at
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we sat up all night long, literally
reading the Bible and him teaching me all
[SPEAKER_03]: the different interpreters.
[SPEAKER_02]: The interpretations of what he thought it
really meant and really deep shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that morning we went and got food.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the last time in my life I ate
chicken.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and we were inseparable after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That day we became best friends and we
started just I started working on the
[SPEAKER_02]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I became the San Diego coordinator and I
worked with him 94 into 95.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one that introduced me to Dennis
Perrone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Browning Mary and Chris Conrad,
Mickey Norris.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're the ones that helped put
together Ben Drucker's Museum in
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one that introduced me to Ben and
the whole Holland scene and high times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And traveling around with Jack was like
having backstage pass to everything we
[SPEAKER_02]: did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was really inspired by everybody I
met.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I started this initiative.
[SPEAKER_02]: The San Diego Compassion Club in 1995.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because while we're meeting all these
people, it was just really heavy duty to
[SPEAKER_02]: meet people that were legitimately really
sick and not be able to give them some
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would always give them whatever I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just couldn't say no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when I was a little kid,
my mother didn't charge me for the
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine I needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: She just gave me the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just can't imagine denying somebody
something that can alleviate their their
[SPEAKER_02]: ills if you have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it comes from being a little kid,
being sick all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have a lot of empathy for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I started the San Diego Compassion
Club, we did not sell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: We redistributed donated cannabis to
people that were sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we made edibles and gave them away and
everything we could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just when you're on the front lines
of the activism, you end up meeting people
[SPEAKER_02]: that have cancer and that have AIDS and
have these different conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how you feel inclined to
help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started the San Diego Compassion
Club in April, March, April of 1995.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got busted shortly thereafter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so it's been a struggle the
whole way through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up getting busted in Ohio with 30
pounds of cannabis heading through Rhode
[SPEAKER_02]: Island because I was going to start
another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to do one in my hometown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead, I got busted in Ohio along
the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because I had and this is a twist.
[SPEAKER_02]: When in 1994, when I was in Holland,
I got a doctor's prescription for medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis from a Rotterdam physician named
Dr. Trussell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he saw my spinal fusion and felt like
my medical use canvas was quite legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he wrote me an actual prescription for
10 grams a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't believe that it was
legitimate until I went home and did some
[SPEAKER_02]: studying of the University of California.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a law library that's really
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was able to look up things like
this, the single treaty Geneva Convention,
[SPEAKER_02]: the psychotropic substances.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was able to look up customs laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, they did not prohibit
the importation of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you look up the way that
internationally cannabis was handled,
[SPEAKER_02]: it fell under the opium rules and the
first treaty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of that, if you had opium
prescribed legally by a country,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could bring it to another country
under the prescription rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was really unique and cannabis fell
onto this, but nobody was doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was one of the first people that
actually challenged the laws, that is it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and went back to Holland and brought back
medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: LV Musica is a woman that gets medical
marijuana from the federal government.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's got glaucoma.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's an old activist.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's in her 80s now.
[SPEAKER_02]: She no longer gets cannabis from the
government because they're giving her
[SPEAKER_02]: swag.
[SPEAKER_02]: But she was one of my first friends as an
activist and a real big inspiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And LV would get in trouble with cops,
but she'd have her prescription and they
[SPEAKER_02]: would not know what to do with this crazy
old lady.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was crazy in a good way, but she was
very boisterous and loud and wouldn't give
[SPEAKER_02]: up and get in their face.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just wanted to get away from her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw the prescription as a real
important thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happened is I came back from the
Netherlands with no prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, with the prescription, but with no
pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was driving up from San Diego
to L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's a checkpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's supposed to be for immigration,
they say, but it's really not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's at Santa No Freya.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's right before this military base
called Camp Pendleton.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like this random checkpoint that
goes up between San Diego and L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they stopped me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had pot on me and I had my
prescription and I demanded to keep my pot
[SPEAKER_02]: or arrest me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't know what to do with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they the cop has this human moment and
says, listen, man, I just want you to go
[SPEAKER_02]: away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, yeah, he's like,
can we come to like a truce on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can have some of the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you've got to give me some pot so I
can go show my boss that I confiscated
[SPEAKER_02]: your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, leave me what's in the
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And take what's in the bigger bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bigger anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because I had I hate to say it,
I had kind of and I had Mexican import
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to give away the Mexican import
weed and share the kind of bud with Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went up to Jackson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, dude, he didn't know what
to do with this fucking piece of paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And me and L.V.
[SPEAKER_02]: L.V.
[SPEAKER_02]: was there at the time and we were all
like, this could be huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then L.V.
[SPEAKER_02]: and I and Richard Davis, the guy that
threw that pot, went up to the Sacramento
[SPEAKER_02]: Law Library and did all the studying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could we came to a conclusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: That there's a lot of legitimacy to an
international prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then L.V.
[SPEAKER_02]: went back home to Florida and she used to
routinely debate the D.A., crazy as it
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But she invited me and Florida Normal,
which stood for the National Organization
[SPEAKER_02]: for Marijuana Laws, invited me out to go
debate the D.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: with L.V.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have this on video.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went out there and I debated the
Southeast Quadrant leader.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I basically asked him, will you arrest
me if I go to the Netherlands to pick up
[SPEAKER_02]: my prescription and fly back?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said it was like 300 people there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you're all my witness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will fly to the Netherlands tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will pick up my prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll fly back and we see if I get
arrested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he looked at me like if looks could
kill kid, I would zap you right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went back to L.V.'s place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called at the time Martin Airlines,
which was owned by KLM is Dutch owned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they allowed smoking on planes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I called, they said, would you
like smoking or nonsmoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you can smoke on an airplane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: International flights over nine and a half
hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, I have a prescription
from my Dutch physician for medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, and I'm supposed to smoke it
about every two hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that be acceptable?
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, are you willing to provide a
copy of your prescription to the
[SPEAKER_02]: stewardess?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she said, then I don't think it's a
problem at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but you have to sit in a smoking
section.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I literally smoked weed from Florida to
the Netherlands in the smoking section
[SPEAKER_02]: legally after giving him my prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I felt like freedom was happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I flew back and they didn't arrest me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I declared it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They freaked out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted me to sign this form that said
that I that I failed to declare a
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled substance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the form that says I declared the
controlled substance and you're taking
[SPEAKER_02]: away my prescribed medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll sign that form, but I don't think you
have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they freaked out and they let me walk
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't even search my other bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would just like go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy actually said, good luck to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And secondary, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He walked me out the double doors and I
realized, wow, there's a lot of power to
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's when I came back home and I went
right back up to Dennis and and really Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Todd McArea, who was one of the OG doctors
that wrote the hemp drug commission report
[SPEAKER_02]: and was really one of him and Lester
Grinspoon first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real first physicians on this in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he saw it, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he prescribed me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me a recommendation for cannabis
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's interesting because as soon as
Dr. Todd McArea gave me a prescription,
[SPEAKER_02]: he started giving a lot of people
prescriptions like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't they were recommendations or
they were letters of condition because at
[SPEAKER_02]: the time all that Dennis required wasn't a
prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a recommendation until 1996.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a letter of your condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but that's kind of like,
I don't know, it's a little much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you don't want to go to
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I got AIDS.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's none of their business, you know,
so it's a little invasive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Dr. McArea was one of my good friends
and he started writing me prescriptions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a little while in California at
the very beginning of 1995, I was the only
[SPEAKER_02]: person that I knew that had a doctor's
note in California that was using it to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to validate their their their
controlled carry of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: LV did have a prescription, but she was
getting her shit from the federal
[SPEAKER_02]: government.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not I was I was just trying to
assert that my doctor would back it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what happened is I got busted in
Ohio and the public defender was more like
[SPEAKER_02]: a public pretender.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got flustered and the judge saw that
and he asked me if I had something to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I stood up while I was still chained
and explained that I was a medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis patient and that I had an
international prescription and that they
[SPEAKER_02]: should look at this on the merits of the
law and not on their opinions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and based it all on fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he liked it and he accepted the single
treaty Geneva Convention.
[SPEAKER_02]: He accepted the the customs laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: He accepted the second seventy nine
psychotropic substances because it also
[SPEAKER_02]: you come to the realization that they were
not trying to prohibit the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: usefulness of cannabis or opium.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were trying to prohibit the potential
narcotic nuisance of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they really never intended to inhibit
medical use per se.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they couldn't have if they wanted to,
because everybody would have met.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but but realistically,
that's how it stood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the judge in Ohio said if I could get
one American doctor to to validate my
[SPEAKER_02]: judge position's prescription,
he'd let me use cannabis while I was
[SPEAKER_02]: incarcerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went home and called my good friend
who's a lawyer in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he called Dr. Todd McArea,
Dr. John Morgan, who wrote Marijuana Miss
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana Facts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he called Dr. Lester Grinspoon about
marijuana we considered and marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all three of them wrote me notes that
night and said that they had personal
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge of me and they've met me and
that they were friends with me and that
[SPEAKER_02]: they all backed it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. John Morgan, who was a professor at
the City University of New York,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually called the FDA and said,
question, if a person, an American goes to
[SPEAKER_02]: Europe and picks up a schedule and
substance under prescription, can they
[SPEAKER_02]: bring it back?
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, yeah, three months supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if it's cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, well, I don't see why not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what country is prescribing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: He said the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And John told me later, he said it was
funny because the guy laughed and he said,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess he found the hole in the dyke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they laughed on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wrote that in the letter,
not the part about the hole in the dyke,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that he contacted the FDA and they
assured him that the importation of a
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule one substance under prescription
from a foreign country for 30 days price
[SPEAKER_02]: most absolutely legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the judge in Ohio didn't know what to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it released me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was amazing because the AP of
Associated Press sat in on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the judge didn't give me the pot,
she released the story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the front page of the newspaper said
inmates smoked pot at CCNO.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the USA Today picked it up and
made this great editorial about why
[SPEAKER_02]: medical cannabis should be legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started off with Todd McCormick left
his home to help seriously ill people.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only problem is the help he intended
to deliver is illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they ended it by saying sick
people deserve help, not a ticket to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, the New York Times
picked up the story and the truck in Ohio
[SPEAKER_02]: just dismissed the case was like,
go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they released me, they told me
you have to leave the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really quite funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, what about my pot?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, I knew you were going to say
that it was my public pretender.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, I don't have to handle that for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a civil matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I only do criminal work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're on your own with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go see the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I left and then high times flew me
over because then I basically showed 60
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes, which is a pretty big news
station around Amsterdam and brought them
[SPEAKER_02]: to my doctor and everything and had like
the more serious side of the of the high
[SPEAKER_02]: times event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were so impressed that they
actually didn't add any of that to the
[SPEAKER_02]: story because they didn't want to
discredit what I was doing because they
[SPEAKER_02]: really thought it was valid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really quite cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm only in a clip of it, which is
funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: But and I spent days with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: High times literally flew me out there so
I could spend time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wally Schaefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but while I was there, the judge was
deciding on whether or not he gave me
[SPEAKER_02]: permission to go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: The judge released my passport and let me
fly back to the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was deciding if he was going to let me
basically if he's going to prosecute me or
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I, while I was in Holland,
ended up getting a job for Highlife
[SPEAKER_02]: magazine and became their first English
editor of their English edition of
[SPEAKER_02]: Highlife, which was really an honor and
really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put out an issue with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hated the winter and I hated the
cold and I hated the rain and all the hash
[SPEAKER_02]: in Holland couldn't make me want to stay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why after a year, I ended up
moving back to California, mainly chasing
[SPEAKER_02]: the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was quite an experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but then I went to L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: and had the most crazy experience because
I met a multimillionaire publisher who had
[SPEAKER_02]: actually contracted AIDS and cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was working on a book about medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he titled it A Question of Compassion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ironically, I named my place the San
Diego Cannabis Compassion Club.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the media, I always used to say
that it was it was not a question of
[SPEAKER_02]: capitalism.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more a question of compassion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, let somebody suffer if
you can help them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems rather, you know, mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he liked that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I met him and I was in his office
and I said, oh, a question of compassion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did you get that title?
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, oh, I stole it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, yeah, come here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he shows me this big computer and he
goes, yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he looks up the newspaper article.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, see you, San Diego Union Tribune,
somebody named Todd McCormick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, kid, you're supposed to
be here right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and it was like we just had this
meeting and he was just he he wanted me to
[SPEAKER_02]: write a book.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wanted me to make a grow video.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wanted me to go around the country
going to like lectures and teaching people
[SPEAKER_02]: how to grow their own medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he got the website growmedicine.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and that was what the whole concept
was going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me a quarter million dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went and looked for a place to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I happened to trip into the
Bel Air mansion that looked like a castle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just we had passed Prop 60,
Props 215.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was naive and thought it mattered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't understand federalism as well
at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't understand that it did not
create a positive conflict between the
[SPEAKER_02]: feds and the state of California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got some misinformation from a good
attorney that if I didn't sell pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: I really couldn't be prosecuted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't sell pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I was prosecuted because even
though they didn't have me for actually
[SPEAKER_02]: selling pot, they charged me with intent
to distribute.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they got into my head and they knew
that overwriting books and putting out
[SPEAKER_02]: movies and traveling around as a lecturer
that I really wanted to just sell pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the basis they prosecuted me
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Initially, they held me on a million
dollar bail for over 4,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friends at the time was Woody
Harrelson, the actor, and Larry Flint,
[SPEAKER_02]: the publisher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they arrested me at 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had Larry's attorneys at the police
station introducing me as my new attorney
[SPEAKER_02]: and trying to help me get out of the
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Woody posted my bond in cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was lowered to half a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Woody posted it in cash, which was
pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never would have expected to have that
kind of support.
[SPEAKER_02]: And went on to fight them for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fought them 97, 98, 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they kind of railroaded me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took away my medical necessity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They took away my defense.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said I couldn't raise, couldn't say
the word medical before the word
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: They redacted my book, How to Grow Medical
Marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really just like, they just,
the truth didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically they gave me the,
they faced a 10 year mandatory minimum if
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to trial and I was gonna lose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I could do a five year sentence and
retain my appeal rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time I was naive and I still
believe that appeal could win.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they wanted me to release my appeal
rights, plead guilty, and go in and plead
[SPEAKER_02]: to the judge for fucking, you know,
to be easy on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just not me, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wasn't gonna go grovel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't gonna denounce cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't gonna debrief.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wasn't gonna play their game.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I accepted the five year sentence with
the hopes that I could appeal the sentence
[SPEAKER_02]: did and I lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then while I was traveling to the
airport in December of 99, I got a traffic
[SPEAKER_02]: ticket and they used the traffic ticket to
revoke my half million dollar bond and
[SPEAKER_02]: pulled me back into jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started my five year prison sentence
because really they just wanted a pound of
[SPEAKER_02]: flesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't care how they got it,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I self surrendered on January 3rd,
2000 and started doing five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after a year and a half,
they sent my lawyer in to ask me if I
[SPEAKER_02]: would debrief, it means cooperate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, fuck no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I sat there for another three and a
half years, because if you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: cooperate, you do time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really boils down to it, that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just ate shit and sat in prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm glad I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't have been able to live myself
if I hadn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, it was difficult, but I'm grateful
at how it all worked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a line in a Grateful Dead song
where they say, sometimes you get shown
[SPEAKER_02]: the light in the greatest, sometimes you
get shown the light in the strangest of
[SPEAKER_02]: places if you look at it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly how I felt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though I was being prosecuted,
I had a lot of support and love from my
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were there when I got out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you never want to fuck up and find out
you don't have friends there for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to have something happen and find out
you're surrounded by people that care
[SPEAKER_02]: about you is really a beautiful
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm still grateful for that element of
it to this day, as weird as it may sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always felt like cancer was a
beautiful, beneficial experience that I
[SPEAKER_02]: had a hard time appreciating while I was
going through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm grateful that I went through it,
because I think it made me the person I am
[SPEAKER_02]: today and I'm proud of myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But would you want to see a little kid
have cancer, never mind over and over and
[SPEAKER_02]: over again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck no.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if somebody had a magic wand and said
they could wave it over my head,
[SPEAKER_02]: take away my cancer experience,
I would break the wand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a beautiful life story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way you've gone on to accept it
all just is almost inspirational.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess after you got out, at what point
did the idea of AG Seedco cross your mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a specific moment where you
thought, God, I've got to do something
[SPEAKER_01]: with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: When did it all start?
[SPEAKER_02]: My intention when I came home in the 90s
was to start a seed company because I had
[SPEAKER_02]: been collecting genetics in Amsterdam and
I had been collecting genetics from
[SPEAKER_02]: California for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a lot of great connections in
California for genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I came home, that was part of what
I was doing was growing up varieties and
[SPEAKER_02]: starting breeding and making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to convince my publisher that
I needed at the time like a quarter
[SPEAKER_02]: million dollar GCMS and a technician to
run it because I wasn't educated in how to
[SPEAKER_02]: run it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I needed the output.
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed the data that would come out of
it as I was working because I needed
[SPEAKER_02]: continual monitoring of my genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I saw them as little laboratories
and I wanted to look into the laboratory
[SPEAKER_02]: window and see what the chemistry was that
the lab technician was making on that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I feel that the carbolic acid
profiles build up and break down over the
[SPEAKER_02]: course of the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And instead of just taking it at one point
and looking at one peak and saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: there it is, I wanted to test daily if I
could afford it and look at it all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: past peak to rejuvenation and just take an
honest look.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the way that at the time the terpenes
were not part of the conversation,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just the way the carbolic acid built
up and broke down.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was working in Amsterdam and I had
the job, I became good friends with Robert
[SPEAKER_02]: Clark, who was a historian we all know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was working on hashish at the time
and he schooled me on so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I came home a student of Rob's and I
was very enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had first tried CBD in Amsterdam when he
gave me some cannabis that was CBD and had
[SPEAKER_02]: no THC because he wanted to see if it
helped my neck pain because he felt like
[SPEAKER_02]: my medical condition was obviously
legitimate and he just wanted my feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first time I ever used it was from
Rob.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he taught me so much about the
complexity of the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: the profiles, the resin glands.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was working on hashish and if you've
read hashish, it's just such a fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had the professor as my drinking
buddy almost nightly for quite a long time
[SPEAKER_02]: while I lived in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't count the amount of nights that we
spent together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And between spending time with him and old
Ed because he wanted to spend time with
[SPEAKER_02]: old Ed Holloway because Ed had come to
Holland before Rob did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ed was already legendary when he left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was one of the old timers.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't many guys like Greg that were
actually growing cannabis in the sixties
[SPEAKER_02]: that are still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ed turned 80 in 1996.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was fucking old and he was a really
smart guy, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was he was on the team of engineers
that broke the speed of sound out at
[SPEAKER_02]: Edwards Air Force Base in the late
fifties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he took an early retirement from
either General Dynamics or one of these
[SPEAKER_02]: big companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when in the early sixties,
his kids were coming back from the first
[SPEAKER_02]: tours of Vietnam and his wife,
he said, was drinking and she had what he
[SPEAKER_02]: called the empty nest syndrome because
their kids were gone at college and now at
[SPEAKER_02]: war.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he when his kids came home,
they brought him some Vietnamese and
[SPEAKER_02]: Cambodian cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ed wasn't a drinker and he fucking
loved the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he told me that after a few years,
he couldn't stand his wife's drinking
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he left her everything but a couple of
his favorite airplanes because he had
[SPEAKER_02]: owned his own airplanes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he started flying around, going to
military bases in places where cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: was indigenous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he could land and just say,
hey, I'm doing research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't question him because he
had clearance from his job that he still
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of worked for because he was an
engineer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he collected cannabis genetics through
the 60s until the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And old Ed then met Bernard Brunning when
Bernard started the Mellow Yellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ed was credited with teaching Bernard
and all these young hippies at the time
[SPEAKER_02]: how to grow seedless cannabis and how he
helped them improve the quality of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis they grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time they called him old Ed
because he was already in his 40s and 50s
[SPEAKER_02]: when they were still in their early 20s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I met him, he was 79 turned 80
and 96 when I was with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I left and came back to
California, we had a very good friendship.
[SPEAKER_02]: He left and he went to my house in Bel
Air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he went home to his family and got a
cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he didn't come back to the mansion
right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got raided.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he fortunately wasn't there when I got
raided.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we still were friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even after that, he didn't come back and
live with me while I was prosecuted,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did pick him up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did stay with me when I was in
various places in LA because one of his
[SPEAKER_02]: daughters lives outside of LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I go pick him up and hang out with the
old man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely adored him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would squeeze cannabis and hold it to
his nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'd give me countries of origin,
not names.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I loved spending time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started martial arts when I was 12 and
I've always appreciated our elders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see guys like Skunkman Sam and Greg
and old Ed and Rob and Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were the people I looked up to
when it came to information and
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an incredible story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so very enlightening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just mentioned Mel Frank there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, what was the first seeds
you ever got from Mel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny enough, a weird thing you say that
because in 1996, when I met him at the
[SPEAKER_02]: 96th Cannabis Cup, I told him I was coming
home in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would look him up when I got there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I came back and I got the place in
Bel Air, he was invited over, but he never
[SPEAKER_02]: made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he invited me over to pick up some of
these skunk seeds that he had made the
[SPEAKER_02]: summer before, which is this 1996 skunk
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I drove over there and I picked them up
and I drove home and I got busted like two
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I lost them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I go to prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get out of prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Years go by.
[SPEAKER_02]: I move out of LA and Jim would always
convince me to visit me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just always had hangout houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he would just make his way to come see
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I moved up here,
I have a really big house and he would
[SPEAKER_02]: come and stay with me and we'd go to the
cannabis cups and the other cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: events.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would always be buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get this idea, like the AG Seed Co
happened when the farm bill passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that, hey, seeds are legal
because all parts of the plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: contain less than three tenths of a
percent THC were now taken out of the CSA
[SPEAKER_02]: and seeds contain zero cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I saw an opportunity there as well as
maybe may take other people a little while
[SPEAKER_02]: to figure it out, but seeds are legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we passed Prop 64 here in
California, I'm legally growing the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone in the state of California over
the age of 21 doesn't even need a doctor's
[SPEAKER_02]: note.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can legally grow six plants,
cannabis, and you can get a good amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds off of six plants, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So technically you can legally grow your
seeds in somewhat ways because they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: federally illegal or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're much like heirloom tomato seeds
where it's, you know, you can grow tomato
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and then sell them on what we call
eBay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not really a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the same as with cannabis
seeds now, because I don't know of any
[SPEAKER_02]: prosecutions that are going specifically
for seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's no drug content.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not really manufactured.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're a product of nature to say
the very least.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a difficult case for a
prosecutor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think a prosecutor really
wants to prosecute somebody for like a few
[SPEAKER_02]: grams of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as you pay your taxes and
you're not, you know, getting caught
[SPEAKER_02]: selling kilos of butter hash out to the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't think it's that dangerous
to sell seeds anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots and lots of seed companies have
popped up, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you drive up what we have called
Interstate 5 up in Oregon, there are full
[SPEAKER_02]: size billboards with 1-800 number of
websites for seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's changing really big over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I contacted Jim, I was already in
contact with Jim, but I made a catalog and
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent it over to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like the dad he is, he corrected my
grammar and sent it back to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I only messed up like a comma and
something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I got like pretty much at 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, and I said to him,
I said, you know, man, you should let me
[SPEAKER_02]: sell your seeds, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to do anybody any good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sitting in your refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, come over and get some.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I drove all the way back down to L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I got there, I had a deja vu
because I hadn't visited him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it felt like a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, hey, man, how long you been living
in this house?
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, I moved into it just a couple of
years before you first visited it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was cute because at the time he had
some seeds on tape because, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: remember, you came up here to pick up
these exact seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went, wow, talk about life
interrupted.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because here we were 23 years
later and I was just picking up the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: to do the same thing I was going to do in
1997.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were still sitting in the
refrigerator for me, which was kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: touching thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it sounds weird, but like sometimes
it's the little things in life that just
[SPEAKER_02]: blow you away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he didn't particularly save those
seeds for me, but he still had some when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was able to come back and get some.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, he's just, I don't know,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely adore Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, I think, one of the nice,
coolest, kindest, humblest, best
[SPEAKER_02]: historians, best photographers.
[SPEAKER_02]: His cannabis photography back to the 70s
is stunning.
[SPEAKER_02]: His use of the camera is magnificent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know anybody with as good of
photos from the 1970s and early 80s of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis as Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_02]: His real name is Jim Goodwin, of course,
but, you know, so that's kind of how it
[SPEAKER_02]: all started really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't expect the skunk one seeds to
smell anything but sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I grew them, he gave me multiple,
he gave me 2010 seeds too that he made in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2010 and those did sell smell sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I stopped and started thinking
about the genetics, I kind of found it
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like not too particular because
him being friends with skunk man Sam and
[SPEAKER_02]: then both being old heads, he would have
most likely gave him seeds from the
[SPEAKER_02]: selections that would have been more like
what Jim would like rather than the newer
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, which was more fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of not surprised that it was more
Afghan dominant rather than the Acapulco
[SPEAKER_02]: gold slash Colombian gold, because as he
was doing his selections, I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a certain amount of time where
skunk one was evolving, we would say,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: From really stinky and acrid, probably a
lot more thiols than it has now to a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: less thiols and a lot more fruity kind of,
you know, that passion fruit kind of yummy
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes that you smell and you just want
to keep smelling.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's my opinion of the
evolution after talking to them both,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're kind of old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I've asked skunk man Sam what he
gave him, he said, I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, when you ask now,
you know, kind of, you know, they know
[SPEAKER_02]: they're skunk seeds, they know they're the
skunk one seeds, but we're along the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how old they were in
1988.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would easily think that they could
have predated Sam moving there in 85
[SPEAKER_02]: because by mid 88, he'd only been there
for like, let's say two and a half years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, part of 85, 86, 87, and now
you're into 88.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could have easily been seeds that he
had had that pre that goat went back to
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa Cruz before he went over there and
started doing more selections and
[SPEAKER_02]: redefining what became skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you understand the evolution of
species in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get exactly what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think it was like a light bulb
turning on and it's like, it doesn't work
[SPEAKER_02]: that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think we slowly moved away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Away from the thials.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think they're still present.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think they're present in minute
amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've considered that sort of thing
for a long time, but it's good to hear
[SPEAKER_01]: that validated by your similar thoughts on
it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was interested in asking you if you
could give us a little rundown of the
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk you offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I hear a lot of people in the past
few years talk about skunk as though it's
[SPEAKER_01]: cool because it's this good strain,
but it's also like one of those older ones
[SPEAKER_01]: which like tended to yield quite nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people these days are really
over the lower exotic plant yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that skunk could be something
for those type people?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people, I've sold quite a
few skunk seeds since I've released them.
[SPEAKER_02]: These seeds that are currently available
are the seeds that have only been
[SPEAKER_02]: reproduced twice since the 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in 1996 and again by me in 2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2020.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are old cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know another way to put
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't had any outside influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been inbred with themselves twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once in 96.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are old pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know another way to put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people who've been growing them
out love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have been talking about
finding skunk scent and taste and aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people want to shoot them down,
but I think it's like the haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more people that get the genetics the
more people are going to have to shut up
[SPEAKER_02]: and realize they're still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's the similar situation
with thiols present in the skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's impossible for me to believe
that these terpene and thiol combinations
[SPEAKER_02]: that were existing 30 years ago just
disappeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that they disappeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that we slowly bred away for
them in favor of higher cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: combinations with sweeter, more aromatic
scents.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we did that, it made our gardens
easier to hide because now it took on a
[SPEAKER_02]: sweet floral fragrance rather than a
stinky, skunky, nasty, what's that dead
[SPEAKER_02]: shit in your backyard fragrance?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that made a big difference in the way
that we were able to cultivate cannabis in
[SPEAKER_02]: urban communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of people don't get
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until the 90s and beyond when carbon
filters became the norm, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: were stinking up their rooms in their
neighborhoods trying to grow this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend once, we used to sleep over all
the time, he used to say to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: bro, now when I smell a skunk,
he's like, I like it because it reminds me
[SPEAKER_03]: of your bedroom and your garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, that's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we were teenagers, we used to sit
up in my bedroom and smoke weed because my
[SPEAKER_02]: grandma used to let us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was the hangout spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what it's like when you're 14,
15, 16 years old, you got nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's funny how you start to like
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now when I smell skunk, I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the side of the road, it reminds me of
old weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the skunk I have still reminds me of
old weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still thiles present in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just tell anybody that doesn't believe
it, just freaking grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell me after you've flowered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting because we don't see
thiles in any other mixture other than on
[SPEAKER_01]: their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's like, you know, people talk as
if there's one roadkill skunk and then
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing else like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think we'll ever see it mixed with
other things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, the RKS that I got from
Jaime in Alaska to me is just very Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a decent smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've taken high quality photos of it and
shared them.
[SPEAKER_02]: People loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My girlfriend likes to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's peppery.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm a hazehead.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just not overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have two of them and I sold a small
batch of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people that have grown them have
agreed with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people are still condemning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you can't have them like it's the holy
grail or something silly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you still see these skunk problems in
hemp fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I say problems like the
overwhelming scent of skunk or something
[SPEAKER_02]: rancid or acrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's still thiles in high numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, these people that are
growing large amounts of low THC cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: are also having neighbors complain about
the smell of skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just not from a small batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from fucking hemp fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that just tells me they're present.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a matter of us breeding them up
if we really want them back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say this, though, you know, just like
there's a synergy between the terpenes and
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be more of a synergy between
the thiles and the cannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes that we know right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we perhaps are underestimating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might be worth it for people to take
the time to try to detect thiles and to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to bring back that funky musty,
stinky smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say it in two words, because I feel like
it's already very present in the skunk one
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds that I'm offering and that I have
and that people are reporting the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you could do more with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if somebody were to take tens of
thousands of these seeds or thousands of
[SPEAKER_02]: these seeds and start really going through
them, you're going to find the Einstein's,
[SPEAKER_02]: the real genius plants in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to find the terpene
combinations that are one in a thousand or
[SPEAKER_02]: one in a whatever, you know, one in
whatever your lottery ticket ends up
[SPEAKER_02]: being.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have the ability to clone it
and carry on those genetics, maybe the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole community could share them,
because I have a feeling, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of times when these good plants pop
up, they may fall into the hands of people
[SPEAKER_02]: that are not making cuttings, are not
making seeds, are not sharing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a lot of my great friends in
Northern California hand me one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: best buds I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I say, can I get a cutting?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they say, oh, dude, that's the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have cuttings of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do like, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, dude, I had a hundred of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're not home to take care of
the cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the way they do their they did
their thing back in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, they leave and they have to go sell
their weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets cold up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no point of being up where you
don't have electricity and you have
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor plumbing in the winter if you
don't have to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of my friends used to go up,
open up their places in the spring,
[SPEAKER_02]: crop out, leave in the fall and spend
their summers down their winters down in L
[SPEAKER_02]: .A.
[SPEAKER_02]: and Southern Cal, selling their pot and
enjoying the beach and taking some time to
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves before they went and work their
ass off and prayed the hill helicopters
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't find them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the life of many of my friends
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one of your earlier answers,
you mentioned how you're a friend with
[SPEAKER_01]: Woody Harrelson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harrelson, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen on your Instagram,
you've also, you know, you've been in
[SPEAKER_01]: photos with Tommy Chong and Willie Nelson
and Hugh Hefner.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's quite quite a good mixture you
got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what I'm interested in is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all stoner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hugh Hefner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hugh Hefner gave the money to found normal
in 1970.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keith Strope presented his idea to the
Playboy Foundation and have liked it,
[SPEAKER_02]: gave him five grand and then gave him 50
and then funded him through the early 70s
[SPEAKER_02]: and used to even let normal use the
Playboy Mansion for their parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I met Hef, it was after I got
raided and I was in the news a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he met me, he shook my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wouldn't let it go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he started telling me about his
involvement with normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I know I'm friends with Keith.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, let's have him out for dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, and he invited me and Keith
over for dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went and we sat in the backyard and
smoked weed together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he talked to me about how he first
smoked cannabis in the 1950s when the
[SPEAKER_02]: beats, the beat, the beats brought it to
him, the beat next, the pre hippies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Allen Ginsbergs and those poets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he ate cookies because he couldn't
smoke weed comfortably around a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: people that were in the magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had cookies made and he would
secretly eat cannabis edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was his trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was amazing experience, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I met him 97, I guess,
and then started going.
[SPEAKER_02]: He allowed me to come over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the first time I had dinner with
him was in 98.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he let me come to all the Playboy
parties, 98, 99, which was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really quite touching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a picture of him and the
woman that was his assistant on the wall
[SPEAKER_02]: because Joni was her name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Joni took a liking to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unbelievably, she came down with
cancer in 1999.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during the summer of 99, I was the one
bringing her medicine and spending time
[SPEAKER_02]: with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she passed away in September.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I attended a funeral at the Playboy
Mansion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I spent my last weekend at the Playboy
Mansion in 1999 to 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I was for the New Year's Eve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had a self, I didn't even tell
Hef I had to go to prison because I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have the heart to ruin this evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just felt so bad about projecting my
sadness onto my friends that only the few
[SPEAKER_02]: people I was there with actually knew that
I had to go to prison on Monday because I
[SPEAKER_02]: just didn't want to ruin anybody's New
Year's Eve.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's fucking 1999, 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to be a wet blanket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I got out of prison, actually,
I had the opportunity to use the Playboy
[SPEAKER_02]: Mansion to raise money for the
legalization effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I produced parties at the Playboy
Mansion in 2007, 2008, and 2009.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a total honor.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2009, I even received a lifetime
achievement award or a lifetime dedication
[SPEAKER_02]: award from Marijuana Policy Project on
stage at the Playboy Mansion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my mom was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I let my mom come to the fucking Playboy
party.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was in a Playboy party.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a Marijuana Policy Project party at
the Playboy Mansion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was one of the producers of the
party.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I couldn't invite anybody I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was pretty funny to have my mom at
Hef's house while I get a fucking lifetime
[SPEAKER_02]: achievement award.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been so strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you said earlier, the truth is much
stranger than fiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first party, I had Joe Rogan MC'd,
blues traveler played.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the gentleman named DJ Poo,
who's one of my best friends to this day,
[SPEAKER_02]: who made the movie Friday and produced all
the albums with Snoop Dogg and Ice Cube,
[SPEAKER_02]: he DJed for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was my DJ at my party because I didn't
know anyone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I asked DJ Poo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my second year, Perry Fowle of Jane's
Addiction played for me because back in
[SPEAKER_02]: the 90s, we were on this thing called
Spitfire Tour together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even crazier than that, in July of
1999, I got to open up Woodstock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to walk out on stage at 11.35 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: on Friday, the 23rd of July and say,
welcome to Woodstock.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name's Todd McCormick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with Spitfire Tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talked about legalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got to do that Friday with oh,
come on, Andy Dick, and then Kennedy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she got booed off stage and I had to
do 20 minutes at Woodstock, improvised
[SPEAKER_02]: because the other girl that was supposed
to speak made it two minutes and she got
[SPEAKER_02]: booed off the stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people at Woodstock were going,
they were screaming, show your tits,
[SPEAKER_02]: show your tits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was the girl that was the DJ from
MTV.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, I will not show you my
boobies.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fucking a moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I looked at her like, do you want me
to get the mic?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was kind of MC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our little set.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she went like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went and got the mic and everybody
started cheering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, and my manager's like
yelling, keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have another 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, who wants 20 more minutes
of me?
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody started cheering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to go out and do 20 more minutes
of like, let's end the drug war,
[SPEAKER_03]: which wasn't really hard for me to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, me talking about cannabis is
really quite fluid, but it was quite the
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next day I got to do it with
Mickey Hart of The Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and Mickey Hart and this girl,
Julia Butterfly was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mickey Hart and Rosie Perez, she was there
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: She spoke about AIDS activism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mickey Hart spoke about deforestation and
why we have to stop deforesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually pretty blown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the fuck, I grew up listening to
Woodstock on my mom's albums.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here I was like meeting Michael Lang
and fucking wearing it all access pass and
[SPEAKER_03]: going out on stage as myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking about weed and nobody knew who I
was, which was really quite strange,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, because I'm not a musician.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not famous and any on any level.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I showed a short video of me getting
busted and a little bit of history of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I started talking and people just
clicked and they loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole little thing went over
really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But while I was being prosecuted,
I really turned it into a soap box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, I toured around to
almost all, not all of them, but quite a
[SPEAKER_02]: few of the major universities speaking
about legalizing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We created this group called Spitfire,
which was actors, musicians and activists.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the idea of Zach De La Rocha of
Rage Against the Machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had the idea of like putting rock
stars and activists together and going to
[SPEAKER_02]: colleges because then the kids would show
up and listen to the rock stars and maybe,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, get a little bit taken away from
the activists.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I toured with Woody Harrelson,
Chris Novoselic of Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_02]: He spoke about censorship and music.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amy Ray of the Indigo Girls.
[SPEAKER_02]: She spoke about gay and lesbian rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kennedy, she spoke about conservative
issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedys.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just fucking dynamic and spoke
about everything that blew our mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had quite a few people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Andy Diff was on tour with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mickey Hart joined us for an event.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really quite cool because the women
that put it together was normally a music
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she would produce concerts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she knew all these like red hot jilly.
[SPEAKER_02]: She knew everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she could just put us like,
you know, what the fuck am I doing touring
[SPEAKER_02]: around with a guy from Nirvana?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And me and Chris became good friends and
still friends, still friends last time I
[SPEAKER_02]: checked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so I think the world of him
really, he does this thing called Fear
[SPEAKER_02]: Vote and he's trying to get ranked choice
voting passed in North America where your
[SPEAKER_02]: vote always counts, meaning that you pick
your favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if your first one doesn't win,
all your votes go to yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your second choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just creates a situation where
every vote counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The politicians are scared shit of it
because it's not just 50-50 at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you can't be an asshole because
if the person you're, you would get the
[SPEAKER_02]: votes from as their second choice if you
don't do good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the work he does politically,
but it was fucking dynamic and I got to do
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of fun shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got out of prison, I was really
more determined to be an activist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Than I was ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I met up with some guys from Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made the first documentary called The
Union, The Business Behind Getting High.
[SPEAKER_02]: That did really well for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got the opportunity to produce
Playboy parties and that went really well
[SPEAKER_02]: for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I rented a hundred thousand
square feet at the Los Angeles Convention
[SPEAKER_02]: Center in 2009 and I held the first THC
Expo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had almost 300 companies and I had over
40,000 people show up that first Saturday
[SPEAKER_02]: that the fire marshal almost shut me down
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really quite amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tommy Chong is somebody I met in the
neighborhood of LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I moved to Bel Air, I started meeting
celebrities and it's kind of strange like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, but you just meet your neighbors and
if you are friendly with them,
[SPEAKER_02]: you never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make friends in the strangest places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Tommy and I became kind of buddies,
like shared numbers and would talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tommy was very supportive of me before
I went to prison because he felt like what
[SPEAKER_02]: the prosecution was just fucking horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they prosecuted him for bongs
while I was in prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tommy and I went through the same halfway
house within a few months of each other
[SPEAKER_02]: and stayed in touch after we got out of
prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was helpful with the Playboy
parties in the way that he was trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: help me connect with other celebrities
because we were just trying to get them to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to speak up and get involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're not rich like Nike.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't just hire Michael Jordan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to like sit down with Kareem
Abdul-Dubar and try to like guilt him into
[SPEAKER_02]: saying good things about me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he's got medical cannabis,
even though he uses medical cannabis for
[SPEAKER_02]: his own headaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: True story, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the funny part is realistically,
the party wasn't the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the networking that was important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it gave us like a, hey,
can I talk to you about our activism?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you donate or would you help out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tommy was always down to help out,
but he never wanted to come to the parties
[SPEAKER_02]: because he hated being like signature mode
and he just hated it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he always came to the pre-planning
parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was really more like touching to me
that he was like, he cared.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a great, great person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of adore Tommy Chong, but I called
him up one day and he has an electric hot
[SPEAKER_02]: rod.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I was high, I'm always high,
but I said, hey Tommy, do you still have
[SPEAKER_02]: your electric hot rod?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, hey, can I borrow it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he got real quiet for a good minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, yeah, yeah, I suppose you
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, where is it you want?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you want to go, Todd?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, oh, Tommy, I'm not trying to go
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rented the LA Convention Center and I'm
going to hold like the first indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis convention on the large scale
here in North America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to put your car on display
because I'm doing this whole hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: education.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for the environment thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love what you're doing with your
electric hot rod.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it's like the environmental side of
you that nobody knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he drives a blacked out Prius.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's not a flashy dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not wearing Rolexes and fucking gold
watches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's not that dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like environmentalist, like
politically cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say when you meet your heroes,
you're often disappointed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get to meet Tommy, you'll be
nothing but blown away because he's just
[SPEAKER_02]: such a good person.
[SPEAKER_02]: His family's so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: His kids are so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he let me borrow his car, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hooked me up with Hippie Motors and
they delivered the car to the LA
[SPEAKER_02]: Convention Center.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came down that day to see what I
was up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I opened the doors and the place got
flooded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was so proud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got countless photos of him giving me
hugs and being happier than anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it felt like vindication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like here we are standing here as a
demographic that can't be ignored.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it felt good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a real powerful moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Woody flew out from Hawaii just to come to
my event.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really quite touching.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends have been great friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel nothing but blessed for the people
I've had in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, so fortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not just because they're famous,
just because they're such good people on
[SPEAKER_02]: such a spectrum of doing good things in
the community on different levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did my second documentary with
the same guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did the Culture High, which included
really a great cast.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 2012, I happened to be getting the
Cannabis Culture Award from Ben Dronkers
[SPEAKER_02]: with Richard Branson and Dr. Lester
Grinstein.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used the opportunity to ask Richard
Branson if he would consider being in our
[SPEAKER_02]: second documentary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he said yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when he saw the film,
he liked it so much that he took it on his
[SPEAKER_02]: own accord and launched it for us on
October 1st, 2014, which was pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible when he wrote this beautiful
blog about legalizing cannabis and what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going on with the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it was really amazing because
you can't get a billionaire to do anything
[SPEAKER_02]: he doesn't want to do if he doesn't want
to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to have that purity was just
incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of because of that,
he helped us get a lot of international
[SPEAKER_02]: press.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was picked up by Netflix and
it was shown in 70 countries in 15
[SPEAKER_02]: languages for three years with various
transcriptions and voiceovers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, I don't know, this whole way
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then unfortunately, when Jack died in
2010, his publisher contacted me and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, you're it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to put the book back out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, we only had the 11th
edition done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put together the 12th edition of the
book and I reached out to a bunch of our
[SPEAKER_02]: friends like Woody and Tommy and Vivian
McPeak of Hempfest and Debbie Goldsberry
[SPEAKER_02]: of Cannes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked them to write memorials to
Jack, Steve Hager of High Times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Steve Bloom, I think I got in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Malcolm McKinnon as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to go through the list,
but they were all really nice to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Tommy, when I wrote to him and
asked them to write a memorial for Jack
[SPEAKER_02]: Herri, he didn't answer my email with a
yes or a no.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just wrote it and sent it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was his reply.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, it was touching because
Jack touched all our lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I used to say that he didn't just
touch our lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: He penetrated our lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was beautiful to know him and to be
so close to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm honored to still be close to all
of his kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish he was still here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love him very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the father I never had on a lot of
levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Jack was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I wish we still had him here
today for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he'd be really proud to see
legalization and the changes that have
[SPEAKER_02]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for Jack, it was not about
protecting the profits of farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about liberating the people that
were affected by the drug war and that
[SPEAKER_02]: were sitting in prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he made me promise that I would fight
as an activist until I was 84 or dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just feel like a lot of my passion and
determination came from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I miss him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was someone that really touched my life
and many others in such a positive way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of us early activists would
say that it was reading The Emperor Wears
[SPEAKER_02]: No Clothes that kicked us in the ass and
really motivated us to do something about
[SPEAKER_02]: the injustice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cannabis prohibition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in 2011, on a brighter note,
Seattle Hempfest turned 20 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I helped Vivian McPeak put together a
20-chapter book called Protestable,
[SPEAKER_02]: which kind of stands for protest and
festival.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we wanted to highlight all the work
that Seattle Hempfest had done to work to
[SPEAKER_02]: legalize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a hell of a journey to be
really blunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm proud of where we are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad to see the liberation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to see cannabis stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe in cannabinoids that it will
help society like it's helped me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish more people had access to
cannabis because I believe that if they
[SPEAKER_02]: did, society would be a much more
beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And less people would be addicted to
pharmaceuticals and alcohol and various
[SPEAKER_02]: substances that you just don't need if you
have good herb in your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, hell of a journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like even selling seeds is a
form of activism because I've lived in the
[SPEAKER_02]: same place for 11 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only been selling seeds for two and a
half.
[SPEAKER_02]: My life hasn't really changed since I
started selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really not about the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really just about trying to do good
for a community that's meant a lot to me
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of helped me survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think I would be where I
am today if it wasn't for cannabis or the
[SPEAKER_02]: insightful doctors that I had that were
willing to give me cannabis over opiates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just really grateful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabis is my form of appreciation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the best way I can honor it is
to spread the seeds around and give other
[SPEAKER_02]: people the opportunity of growing and
experiencing the varieties that have come
[SPEAKER_02]: through me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't invent cannabis, so I can
breed it together all I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not going to be one of these guys
that thinks he's cool or a fucking rock
[SPEAKER_02]: star breeder or any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody should do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just grateful to be the bridge
between these old growers, these old
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders, and a new generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a powerful recount there of your life
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible, to say the least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks so much for sharing the very
personal relationship you have with Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really inspiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had just a small number of questions
left, including our rapid fire ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're sort of on the tail end of it
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been fun talking to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: COVID's kept us in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to go to coffee shops and meet
strangers and talk to them for hours and
[SPEAKER_02]: become friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't been out of the house in a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's me and my girlfriend working all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of nice to have been talking
to you and going over this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't realize I haven't talked about
Jack in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my own surprise is in this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But thanks for entertaining it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope that people take something from
it, to say the least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I'm sure they will.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great from my position.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I could probably guess the answer
to this question, but I haven't asked you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What style of growing do you like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you a soil, organics guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I organic pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get LED lights and I get drip run to
waste irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use Dosatrons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I use a Roots Organics 707 as a
medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a very good company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put out a very good product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use some of Arian's greenhouse powder
feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like his bio line and his mineral line,
both very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use those in addition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really spray much on my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like extracts and I don't want anything
on the flowers other than water.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as growing tips, I would say that a
long time ago I started using ionized
[SPEAKER_02]: water, which is electronically ionized for
its acidity or alkalinity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can use this water to either
de-grease or basically debug.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't leave anything behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been recommending to my friends
that they buy these water ionizers and
[SPEAKER_02]: they start to use like high alkaline water
in order to rinse off powder and they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: do an acidic water to deal with bugs
because acid rain showed us that we kill
[SPEAKER_02]: the insects, but acid rain also kills the
insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you use an acidic water,
you can actually do it without harming the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The alkaline water though, I am very
hesitant to spray on flowering plants
[SPEAKER_02]: because the high alkalinity will emulsify
the oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to use it more sparingly than
the acidic water, but it works great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if anybody's still deep,
this deep and new listening, I recommend
[SPEAKER_02]: using hemp seed oil as a solvent to
dissolve the trichrome heads on the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis flowers that people grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years ago, I was sitting home rather
stoned and I was using a Merinal and I had
[SPEAKER_02]: used an AB epoxy that day, which is,
you know, two parts resin that makes a
[SPEAKER_02]: hard bind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was thinking, shit, synthetic
molecules suspended in sesame oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if I used organic cannabinoids and
suspended them in hemp seed oil?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went and I scooped up some resin
powder and I put it in some hemp seed oil
[SPEAKER_02]: that I had heating up in a frying pan and
it melted into the hemp seed oil and
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylated and I put it on muffins
like it was a butter and I got really
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started playing with grinding up the
cannabis or just using my, because I have
[SPEAKER_02]: seed screens, you know, 60 mesh and 150
mesh and bunch in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would collect my resin powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you just put resin powder in a jar
of hemp seed oil and you agitated a
[SPEAKER_02]: little, the hemp seed oil being an oil
will break down the trichrome,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is also an oil, and it will release
the acids and the terpenes into the oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can take like a stainless
steel strainer or whatever you want,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can actually strain the hemp seed
oil of any of the thicker waxes that
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't dissolve with the hemp seed oil as
easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what you have left is phyto
cannabinoid infused non-decarboxylated and
[SPEAKER_02]: all the terpenes in the hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can do this in your refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes like 10 to 20 days sometimes for
the oil to break down the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once it does, it's so much better than
like an alcohol-based ethanol extract
[SPEAKER_02]: because alcohol doesn't evaporate off to
like 170 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time it does, it's evaporated
away most of the more mono-terpenes and it
[SPEAKER_02]: has decarboxylated the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had this realization that if we could
consume higher amounts of phyto
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids without decarboxylating them,
we might find that it's a better medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: for a lot of people who are not trying to
get like loopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you have a little kid that's
having seizures or like me, a little kid
[SPEAKER_02]: at the time that was going through chemo,
you probably don't want them all stoned
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can actually give him phyto
cannabinoids in hemp seed oil,
[SPEAKER_02]: which in itself has a perfect balance of
essential fatty acids, then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: actually medicate the trichomes without
drugging the child for lack of better
[SPEAKER_02]: terminology, but people would get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be very beneficial because
cancer patients have shown that using like
[SPEAKER_02]: a thousand milligrams of decarboxylated
THC was beneficial for the
[SPEAKER_02]: anti-inflammatory effects of like reducing
tumor sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my thought is that you can actually
take thousands of milligrams of phyto
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids that are not decarboxylated
and have the anti-inflammation properties
[SPEAKER_02]: without being completely sleeping for the
next 48 hours, which is nice if you're,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if you're dying, you want to be
awake for most of the rest of your life,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and not completely drugged out
and loopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really recommend that people start
looking at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, home growing is blowing up now
that it's legal and people have the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability of, of making their own medicine
instead of going out and buying it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, $80 an eighth in a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can have big branches of it for
practically nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, once they have an abundance
of cannabis, starting to look at hemp seed
[SPEAKER_02]: oil and preserving it is much better
because if you make jars of phyto
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid infused hemp seed oil,
you can keep that in cold storage for a
[SPEAKER_02]: very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those phyto cannabinoids and terpenes
will remain very viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the oil smells amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some flower terpene combinations smell so
good with the nutty scent of hemp seed
oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my little bit of advice to anyone who's
still listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to give that a try
myself actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've spoken a lot about some of the more
old school strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would be keen to hear what are
your thoughts specifically on the new
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, you know, the hype exotic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're a fan of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you not a fan of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And will we ever see any of it blended in
with the some of your lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big pothead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I probably smoked four joints
while we've been sitting here talking,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I love pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my complaints about the pot that
has been floating around prior to me
[SPEAKER_02]: starting AG is that it's all very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that is, you know,
it's not good for the community to the
[SPEAKER_02]: degree in which there's a lot more
diversity in the genetics that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced and we're seeing in the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to affect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that in a way, I don't think the
high is as good as it could be on many
[SPEAKER_02]: levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I unfortunately think that,
you know, unless you grow your own
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, you kind of don't understand
what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's so much that happens
negatively to cannabis in post-harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really handling that ruin smells pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people get it and they don't dry
it correctly and they lose some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes in a flash cure or a flash dry,
they bottle it up or it was too moist and
[SPEAKER_02]: it kind of gets that funky little smell
that doesn't go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not handled properly, the variety
itself isn't going to matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've joked with people that I can go
pick hemp and cure it and dry it properly
[SPEAKER_02]: and it'll smoke and taste and smell better
than some of the stuff I get from
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because if you put the time into
retaining the terpenes and the oil content
[SPEAKER_02]: and doing that slow dry and slow cure,
because a lot of people don't understand
[SPEAKER_02]: even what's a cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the flower is covered with oil and
think of it like varnish on a piece of
[SPEAKER_02]: wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put varnish on a piece of wood and
you leave the piece of wood in the sun,
[SPEAKER_02]: the wood soaks up the varnish and there's
no protective layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it rains on it, it kind of doesn't
really repel it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you take that same varnish piece of
wood and you put it in the shade and that
[SPEAKER_02]: coat of oil doesn't soak in but it
thickens, it then becomes a protectant to
[SPEAKER_02]: the wood and you can pour water on it and
it just runs off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happens on a microscopic level on
cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people allow that thin covering
of oil residue to that waxiness to harden
[SPEAKER_02]: up, it protects the humidity that's left,
should be less than 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then the bud has body, it has flavor,
it has terpenes present and it's a really
[SPEAKER_02]: good smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like fresh pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like smoking weed a week after I cut it
down and I can barely get it to burn,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it burns perfect because there's so
much oil content.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I also like pot that I've let sit
in the freaking, you know, canna troll for
[SPEAKER_02]: eight months or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally I have a lot of old weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have RKS from last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked some of it earlier today and I
still like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a year, it's September last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's a year and a month old.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I end up with bags of weed and then
they turn brown after they oxidize because
[SPEAKER_02]: the lights cut through them and it's
freaking hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you cure it well and those oils are
still present, the quality of it lasts a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of how you're going to feel
cannabis is determined by how well it was
[SPEAKER_02]: handled and how well it was cured before
it got to your plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so I think if everybody,
if you had every clone that all these
[SPEAKER_02]: people would grow and all the new stuff,
I bet you'd grow great weed with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you'd grow it and you might leave it
a little longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might bring it into late stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might let the little, you know,
little pistols wither away and turn into
[SPEAKER_02]: little resin globs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you might treat it a little
differently than the grower that you got
[SPEAKER_02]: it from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might like it a little,
you might on the other side, you might
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest it a little early, might like the
high a little lighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that dial a high is something a lot of
people don't realize either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like if you harvest early,
you get a different sensation from the
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you harvest it late stage and you
can take things like haze and let it go
[SPEAKER_02]: really late stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really trippy, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could take like Afghanis and
harvest them early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like week six, week seven, and they're not
heavy body highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really almost kind of hazy where
they're like light and trippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to teach people that there's so
much more than one dimensional cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: has been kind of tough because a lot of
people don't, they just don't see the
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you were saying,
they think there's one, there's one RKS.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one skunk and it's like,
no, man, it was a body of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, I don't even know what
region, but, but when I talked to Rob
[SPEAKER_02]: Clark and I talked to Skunkman Sam,
you know, Skunkman Sam has gone through
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan and collected seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know many other people that have
been there and done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and he has the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what the fuck, you know, take his
experience and you know, it's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when all those Afghans started coming
over, it was this region that produced
[SPEAKER_02]: these, these plants that were like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that a lot of people gonna
find them again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that if, you know,
if ever this world goes to peace and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, maybe we would find a lot of these
absolutely amazing Hindu Kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: Indian varieties, Chinese varieties,
Afghan, Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these, this is the birthplace of
cannabis people.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where we need to go back and start
looking around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the Himalayas, Nepal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, every time I see people that are
in foreign countries like this and they
[SPEAKER_02]: contact me for seeds, I'm like,
no, no, no, you should be going out and
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And geographically collecting those so you
know where they came from, what region,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not gonna give people up,
but make them available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring them out of the, bring them to
market, you know, because that's what we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to have happen again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I would love to be able to buy
seeds from Thailand tomorrow on Amazon and
[SPEAKER_02]: then actually come from Thailand,
you know, or some seeds from Columbia or
[SPEAKER_02]: some from Michoacan or Acapulco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, you know, it'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be thrilled.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only sad part is that I think there's
been a lot of, you know, European seed
[SPEAKER_02]: merchant influence in almost all the
cannabis producing regions around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, almost all of it has
been contaminated with good intention
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we move on to our final questions,
we have a few fan submitted questions that
[SPEAKER_01]: I think are interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first one is, how far do you plan
on taking the Northern Lights lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you see yourself going to like an
F5 and F6 sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a follow up, would you ever release
the famous Northern Light as an S1?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe they're referring to Pura
Syndica.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Pura Syndica.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's funny is Greg told me that
he didn't send Pura Syndica to Neville and
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna release it because it's
Greg's wishes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like I'm just like,
you know, I was on the phone with Greg
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier today, you know, whatever you want
me to do is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I feel like I'm more of a
conduit than I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm trusted and I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm grateful that these people like me and
I'm grateful that they've entrusted me
[SPEAKER_02]: with the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know another way to put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to release Pura Syndica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I released, you know, instead of just
hybrids, I kind of wanted people to have
[SPEAKER_02]: the ability to have these things isolated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as an F2 is the only way I can do it
realistically, other than S1 and S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them kind of takes away the male
ability of people to breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really not trying to stifle other
people's ability to work with these
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to enable it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do, you know, something that gets
confused though is taking things F2,
[SPEAKER_02]: F3, F4, F5 does not necessarily make them
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not necessarily make them more
stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: According to Rob in marijuana botany,
it creates more really more variation
[SPEAKER_02]: within the prodigies, the further you get
into this inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're always, you know, cannabis is an
obligant out-crosser, just like humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't want to be inbred with its
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wants to be out-crossed if you really
want to make good things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely going to make the genetics
I have available to people as I have been
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, F2 in the haze,
the skunk and the NL, but I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: selling hybrids of my own since I started.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the first things I started
selling were the crosses with on haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to continue to be making,
you know, I'm just so into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm going to constantly release the
genetics because, you know, you only live
[SPEAKER_02]: so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'd like to, you know,
leave as big of a mark on the planet as I
[SPEAKER_02]: can in a positive way before I check out,
which I will inevitably do at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, trying to get it out there
is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, as long as I'm improving
what I'm doing, I'm going to keep doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but like trying to, you know,
these people, they're like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: F99 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like cut out with the bullshit
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I'm happy with the
really good F1 and consistency and
[SPEAKER_02]: uniformity, like, you know, head over
heels for the serious seeds offerings that
[SPEAKER_02]: Simon puts out because they're true F1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and he'll always put out awesome
weed because they're true F1s and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, and I'll make, I'll always be making
F1s and S1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it's appropriate, like it is
right now, I'll be making F2s,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't see myself, you know,
I don't know, you know, once you've,
[SPEAKER_02]: once you have, I, I'll make original
hayseeds again, when I run low on the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount I've already made, if that makes
sense, but there's no need for me to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to replicate it now while I still have
pretty good quantity of original hayseeds
[SPEAKER_02]: for 2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I will in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know I have dreams of,
of, you know, I've, you know, I want all
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants, all the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a gardener, you know, I, I,
you know, people like, how can you have
[SPEAKER_03]: 4,000 plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I was like, so easy, like I was
partying all the time too.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had actually been focused,
I would have had 40,000 plants in that
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you just, you want all the
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to go through all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to try all of them, you know,
and what's funny is I would have thrown
[SPEAKER_02]: 90% of those plants away and only taken
the 10% that I really liked if I had left
[SPEAKER_02]: to my own devices and allowed to continue
on what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go through shit tons of plants that
throw shit tons of plants away that I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I won't replicate anything that
I don't fall in love with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so if it, and testing to me is not as
important as falling in love with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, if, if it doesn't, you know,
if it doesn't appeal to the human,
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't care if it appeals to the
machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not doing this to have fast
quarter mile times or the highest THC
[SPEAKER_02]: levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think a lot of that's missing
the point entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, very comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sort of segues nicely into the next
question, which is if you had to give a
[SPEAKER_01]: generalized answer, where would you like
to see the future of breeding going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Quality over quantity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's my goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think that we're going to see
the bottleneck kind of come off and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to see cannabis varieties,
you know, from all weeks of its potential
[SPEAKER_02]: start to surface as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more and more and more people are
going to realize that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot more, you know, to cannabis
than just, you know, quick thick buds that
[SPEAKER_02]: are full of resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's nuances to these
terpenes and these, you know, subtle
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid combinations.
[SPEAKER_02]: That are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Mel Frank told me one of his
favorite varieties that he grew and he
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked, he got tested and he came back at
like sub nine percent THC and he was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't expect that, you know, but the way
it smelled, the way it tasted,
[SPEAKER_02]: the way it made him feel felt great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's that, you know,
if that makes sense, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, really, I guess it isn't just THC at
the end of the conversation that matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's did you enjoy it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you didn't enjoy it, you're
probably not going to smoke any more of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you didn't enjoy it, you'd probably
be quick to roll up another second or
[SPEAKER_02]: third joint, do a second or third dab,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he quality over quantity for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Final fan submitted question we have is
how did you develop your cloning tech with
[SPEAKER_01]: the domes and the fluorescent lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you get that from someone else?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was old tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so I don't use domes downstairs
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a humidity controlled room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I monitor my PPD levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep my mother room at around 72 to 75
degrees Fahrenheit and I keep my humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: around 70, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you keep your humidity levels at
high, the plants don't wither.
[SPEAKER_02]: The domes are when I was living in L.A.,
it's a lot more dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you were looking at that rack of
shelves that was from Select Strains when
[SPEAKER_02]: I started my nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of the clone racks from my
nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: But L.A.'s a really dry place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in order to compensate for the dryness,
I can't humidify the whole room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had hardwood floors and you don't
want to humidify a room with hardwood
[SPEAKER_02]: floors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just use domes and they work rather
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cloning is easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my problem has been I've had too
green of a thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's gotten me in trouble over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got out of prison in 2004 and in between
all the activism that I explained,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got prosecuted in 2006, 2009 and also
2013 through 2017 for cultivating
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was raided in 2006, 2009 and 2012 and I
wouldn't cooperate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got prosecuted every single time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's no other way to do it,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's been a pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why kind of now I'm kind of
doing what I'm doing because I'm able to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of grow on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is all about quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about quantity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's and I kind of feel like I'm doing
a service for the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds weird, but it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I don't have I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already where I want to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already doing what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like I said, my life hasn't changed
much in the time I've started the seed
[SPEAKER_02]: company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in many cases, I'm using the
same table, same equipment that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: using before I had the seed company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'll just continue this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I could see in the future trying
to sell authentic genetics to a bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: company so that I could, you know,
get like my own winery and have my own
[SPEAKER_02]: crew and have greenhouses and be able to
on a much larger scale, be able to breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be my dream and be able to then
sell the, you know, the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds that I make through my,
you know, sold company because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's a part of me that
doesn't want to be a secretary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't enjoy the business side of it
as much as I just enjoy growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where my heart is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where my passion is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like writing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like creating content, educating,
you know, sitting there, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sending invoices and packing seeds is
rather a burden, but I'm grateful for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not exactly what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be when I grew up, you know,
but it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dealing with it for the time being.
[SPEAKER_02]: My eyes hurt from doing emails,
but it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're a man who wants to be among
the plants, not the computer screens I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, we're on to our final five
quick questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we wrap this one up, we'd love to
ask everyone these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one is, what's the single
most memorable experience with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: you've ever had?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was probably getting my mom that first
time in the car because it was so what the
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck, you know, it was like, I just didn't
ever, I never, I never felt that way
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Giddy and hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everything was funny and I didn't
have any pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't nauseous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, when you're going through
cancer, you're feeling pretty low,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like you're depressed,
you're physically ache, you're mentally
[SPEAKER_02]: strained, you're worried, you're anxious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be able to get high, I can't
underestimate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, it was a huge difference,
you know, and that's probably why I became
[SPEAKER_02]: such a passionate advocate and activist
because it made a really deep impact on my
[SPEAKER_02]: life and my health and my wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel grateful to it because of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
was there ever a time when maybe all your
[SPEAKER_01]: peers or your friends are really hyping
something up?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're getting really excited for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you finally try and you're like,
this is it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is runs?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's cute.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, Skittles was one of those
two, you know, I'm old.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I first got handed a Skittles bud,
I was like, guys, I smell skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, because I don't know some
of the, because I've had the ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with some of these old genetic
insects in their pure form, I kind of can
[SPEAKER_02]: smell them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see the primary colors, if that
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can smell the primary colors coming
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you can't really hide it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's happened more than once.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of the stuff that's come
out in the last, you know, cookies,
[SPEAKER_02]: please, you know, like a lot of the stuff
that's come out has been like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I like cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll smoke cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes not so great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Harrah, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I used to love Jack Harrah when
we first got it from Sensei Seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: when it was really hazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they changed it in 1996.
[SPEAKER_02]: It crossed it with the skunk, kind of
imitated the SSH.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was their version of SSH.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Jack Flash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a heavier version that came out
around 1996 from Sensei Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they kind of replaced Jack Harrah with
Jack Flash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the Jack Harrah that we now
refer to 1997 onward is really Jack Flash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really like a super silver
haze-ish, because it's really a haze
[SPEAKER_02]: crossed with skunk, which is what super
silver haze was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Neville's haze crossed with skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a similar recipe done a little
differently with similar plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, and it's funny because I like the
original Jack Harrah and I like the
[SPEAKER_02]: original Neville's haze more than I like
the super silver haze or the Jack Flash.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Jack Frost, XJ39, a lot of these Jack
crosses that we see now are not very hazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't, you know, Jack, his kids are
using the name and they're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: create a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not trying to exploit an old
friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, I have haze, so I can
make really hazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people talk about Jack Harrah,
really they're smelling a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: haze, but I have the whole pie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can make stuff that's way hazier than
the Jack Harrah hazy hybrids that are
[SPEAKER_02]: floating around right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like different, if that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm definitely going to be bringing way
more haze hybrids back in the years to
[SPEAKER_02]: come because it's my fancy and my
fascination and because I have the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exciting to see that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could only pick one for the rest
of your life, what would you pick,
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor or outdoor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like bird shitting on my flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's very sanitary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem with growing outdoors is
that you're susceptible to Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: She, you know, she gives, you can work so
hard and so true and so valiantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she just comes along and has that
really damp, you know, August or a really
[SPEAKER_02]: dry one, or, you know, fucking fires and
that you get fall out and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: or some kid next door is freaking playing
with some seeds and he pops some nails.
[SPEAKER_02]: And next thing you knew, you've got
fertilized flowers that you didn't expect
[SPEAKER_02]: to have because pollen travels really
easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's a lot of drawbacks to
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think outdoor will mostly be used for
extracts because it can be cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that small batch outdoor can be
awesome because there's nothing like the
[SPEAKER_02]: sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my favorite is mixed light indoor
greenhouse because my greenhouse also has
[SPEAKER_02]: led supplementation and I have,
you know, VPD control and heat and the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to cool it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, I'm Mother Nature at
that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the environment fucks up, it's my
fault, not hers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, you know, surfing the wave as
she skidded to me on hot days or dry days
[SPEAKER_02]: or rainy days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just readjust the equalizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my greenhouse and try to stay in my
parameters and keep my plants happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to have a roof over my plant's
head and I like avoiding the winds and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, but I still grow indoors for
practical reasons because I got to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: mother plants and I got to keep clones and
you're not going to do that in the
[SPEAKER_02]: sunshine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also, I like indoor flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think they're great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gives me an ability to kind of see
the expressions of the phenotypes in a
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled environment where everything's
equal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, where when you're outside,
you know, one can get a little more sun or
[SPEAKER_02]: what could be in a little sweet spot,
but when it's indoors, it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all sweet spots or you're not
setting up your environment correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for testing reasons, I'll always be an
indoor grower, you know, for, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse, I'll always have a greenhouse
too, but I'll always, yeah, but outdoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I like putting plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done it many times, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's like roll and dice with
mother nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you'll get a good harvest,
but if she's mad, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm interested to know if I'm going to
drop you off on a desert Island and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can only take three strains with you for
the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: What three are you going to take?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it'd be Hayes for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be now Northern Lights,
probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: NL2 or purest Indica would have to be one
of those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the purest Indica, but then I
wouldn't have an Afghan to make the NL2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then third, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for the diversity of it,
it would be something similar to skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: one, because I like the tropicalness of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I say skunk one, I like the sweet
version of skunk one, as well as the acrid
[SPEAKER_02]: version I found in the Mel Frank's old
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of, I like the fruity tropical
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I had Hayes, skunk one,
even the sweet skunk one, and either the
[SPEAKER_02]: purest Indica or the NL2, I'd be pretty
happy because at that point I would have
[SPEAKER_02]: the gassy, I would have the fruity and I
have the spicy and I would be thrilled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I could make all sorts of great
shit because, and I'd need a few more
[SPEAKER_02]: lifetimes on the Island just because of
all the hybrids I'd want to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then time to test them, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then time to make hash with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Covering all the bases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And onto our final question, one I love to
ask everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could get in a time machine and go
back in time, anywhere you wanted,
[SPEAKER_01]: any time, presumably to collect either
seeds or a cutting, where would you go and
[SPEAKER_01]: what would you be collecting?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's heavy, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came home from Amsterdam with over
50,000 seeds and they were stolen from me
[SPEAKER_02]: when I got raided and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's tough because I had such a
diversity in genetics at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could have my own seeds because
it sounds really weird to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it hurt to lose them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me up to that point a lifetime of
collecting and then they took them all and
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, that hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could still see them in front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's partly why people listening,
partly how I got the deal from Peter is,
[SPEAKER_02]: he offered me 10 grand and he offered me,
I'm calling you right now, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: He offered me 10 grand and 8% of my book
and I turned them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had mailed back some seeds and
when I mailed them back, he was there with
[SPEAKER_02]: me when I opened the packages,
the boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had boxes too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent him goodies as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the statue of limitations is as
long as I'm long up, but I started pulling
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds out instead of hash and grass,
which is what he wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started pulling seeds out, packages of
1,000, all neatly marked with the
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was shocked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he grabbed a bag of seeds,
he was like, how much is a seed worth?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I don't know, five bucks,
10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, this little baggie is worth
10 grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was like a pile and a half of,
there was a huge amount of in front of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, how many seeds are there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent an excess of 50,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, no wonder you said no to my
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, what are you going to do
with those?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, hopefully keep them,
you know, but I want to start,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I want to start a seed company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, no, you have to keep them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, you have to grow them,
every one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was just like, would you take a
quarter million?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would that, I'll give you a credit card
too, but like, let's get you started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he literally turned to my girlfriend
and he was like, do you still have the
[SPEAKER_02]: keys to my car?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we've used this car.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: She said yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, let's bring them to the bank
before he changes his mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he got up in a robe.
[SPEAKER_02]: With fucking shower shoes, little fucking
fuzzies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he was gay.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a bird running around on his
shoulders, shitting on his white robe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had us drive him down to the Wells
Fargo bank in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we walked in, this dude's wearing a
robe and got bed head for days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we go in there and the manager runs up
to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, Mr. McWilliams, how are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like some organic milk?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have it in the fridge for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he whisked us there to the
manager.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I want to put a quarter million
dollars in his bank account.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to need a company card.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do you need?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I can't think of much more
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, we'll get back to you if we
need more stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like my life changed in a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, and that's kind of how it happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I immediately started looking for
a place to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found the castle, which was utterly
ridiculous, but had a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I moved into it and I had a fucking,
I literally had a card with no limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter was like, very encouraging.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was very wealthy at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, he thought he was dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, unfortunately he died two and a
half years after we met.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just, he was living like his life
was ending.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had no limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bought fucking diamond lights and
fucking built the tables, brought
[SPEAKER_02]: electricians in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking, everything was fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put my ballast in my elevator shaft
because I had this like 70 foot elevator
[SPEAKER_02]: shaft that went from the ground floor all
the way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put massive fans in my attic and I
pulled the air all the way through fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: air from my garage, which was like a six
car garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had 38 lights in one room and I used to
pull all the air through up into my
[SPEAKER_02]: elevator shaft, up the elevator shaft and
through out of the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: The place was incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was located directly across from
something called the stone canyon
[SPEAKER_02]: reservoir.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it created this little humid zone in
the canyon I lived in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't even have to use domes when I
made clones, it was like perfect VPD all
[SPEAKER_02]: the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you could put any plant you wanted
outside and it loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had plants going up my staircases all
over my patios in the courtyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took this Hayes plant that was like,
I'd say almost 16 feet tall and dragged it
[SPEAKER_02]: into my elevator with a twisty fluorescent
light bulb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant was like half bent over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you got in the elevator,
this Hayes plant was like really big
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves, but super thin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, it was weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a big bear hugging you,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it was just stuffed in the corner
and the stem was like bent all the way,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the way over at an angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I put a little table in it where
you could do like single bong hits as you
[SPEAKER_02]: took elevator rides.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a kid's fantasy is really what it
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for a stoner, a psychedelic pot
grower, it was fucking great while it
[SPEAKER_02]: lasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, I don't regret it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never planned for it to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope nobody listening thinks that I had
some stupid dream of moving to Bel Air and
[SPEAKER_02]: growing fucking thousands of plants in a
fucking mansion, but it just, it's what
[SPEAKER_02]: happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes when you're letting life take
you, takes you some strange places.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the theme of this
interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's taken us to some strange places,
but nevertheless, incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledgeable, insightful, very grateful
to have been able to hear all your
[SPEAKER_01]: insights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's just about the end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have any comments or shout outs
you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we've talked about a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was really nice, Jordan,
to sit and talk with you, go over this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I hope it's inspirational to
people listening, you know, if anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's been the point of my life
is to inspire others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been very inspired.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was great to have this inspiring
conversation with you and thank you for
[SPEAKER_02]: taking the time and I hope people enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the longest conversation I've ever
had on a podcast, but I've never gone over
[SPEAKER_02]: this much material and, you know,
for the history books.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you have it friends,
part two of two with the legend,
[SPEAKER_01]: Todd McCormick of AGC Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge shout out and thank you again for
taking the time to stop by, share all your
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge and thoughts on various topics
we discussed and a little bit of an idea
[SPEAKER_01]: for what might come in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: As usual, we want to give another quick
shout out to our fantastic sponsors.
