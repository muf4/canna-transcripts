[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you enjoy this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into it
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty gang we're back for another one
and on this episode We are very grateful
[SPEAKER_01]: to have none other than John hunt from
purple scientific Joining us to talk all
[SPEAKER_01]: about the purple pro today a big thank you
and welcome to John for joining us
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to be on the podcast Thank you
so much for joining us first question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to ask you tell me a little bit
about you What was your first experience
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow first experience with cannabis was
probably like fifth or sixth grade here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the states One of my friends older
brothers had some and we ended up on like
[SPEAKER_00]: a Friday or Saturday night in grade school
Getting completely blasted and staying at
[SPEAKER_00]: his house and watching movies and pretty
much ever since then it was a Not always a
[SPEAKER_00]: daily part, but definitely something that
had been been regular throughout the years
[SPEAKER_00]: grade school high school college And even
into now with you know being an adult But
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that was the that was the first
true experience that actually like seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: it smelling it smoking it all that stuff
which shit that would have been like 93 or
[SPEAKER_00]: 94 something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a long time ago That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you happen to remember?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was like the first kind bud you got
in terms of like a strain name or like
[SPEAKER_01]: what was sort of going around at the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So not in grade school really I think it
was kind of hit or miss on whatever we
[SPEAKER_00]: could find being that that young and
finding stuff out I will say that once I
[SPEAKER_00]: got out of college or out of high school
and into college in Baltimore on the East
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast There was definitely some some
things hazes and and sours and diesels and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that with that would come
around Not all the time, but every so
[SPEAKER_00]: often and there definitely would be kind
of like a heads up that there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some good smoke Coming through
those would be the first ones which was
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like, you know 2000 to 2003 and
there I mean in in high school being in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of the states in Missouri.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a ton I do remember,
you know at one point it was like driving
[SPEAKER_00]: 45 minutes each way to pick up a bag that
that stems and seeds in it and Stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that from from way back in the day So
probably the opposite of kind bud in in
[SPEAKER_00]: high school compared to what I was able to
find being in college on the East Coast
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, I'm jealous those East Coast guys
talk very loyally about some of the hazes
[SPEAKER_01]: they got back in the day That's that's
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know you've had significant industry
experience Do you want to give us a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of an idea of how you sort of came to
be working with Purple Scientific and a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit on your background?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Yeah, I mean I so I live in
Denver, Colorado and since 2008 2009 I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been involved with the medical industry
here in Colorado I lived in a lovely
[SPEAKER_00]: little place called Aspen and helped get
the first patient collective together and
[SPEAKER_00]: had a Grove facility there that we
operated out of for a while Then moved to
[SPEAKER_00]: Durango and started a dispensary there and
had a big Grove facility and that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: worked its way from being in the mountains
to moving down to Denver so in 2012 when
[SPEAKER_00]: we moved to Denver I worked on various
different projects breeding projects Grove
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities And then in 2014 I was hired to
kind of start Staff train and set up the
[SPEAKER_00]: first recreational testing facility in
Colorado, which was called Steep Hill,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado And through that work of about
eight to nine months That took me into a
[SPEAKER_00]: different aspect with purchasing
dispensaries here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a shop in Denver We had a shop
in Colorado Springs Also at Grove
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities in each one of those cities had
a production lab there It was in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Springs as well and that was pretty much
like 2014 all the way through 2019 And
[SPEAKER_00]: currently I still am involved with a place
that's in Arkansas and just finished up a
[SPEAKER_00]: long part of a place that's in Portland,
Maine So it's been different aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's working on training staff or
staffing up or designing facilities or
[SPEAKER_00]: overseeing Grove facilities and
dispensaries And that kind of brought it
[SPEAKER_00]: to purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am from st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis Missouri where purple is
headquarters and the guys that founded
[SPEAKER_00]: purple found me through some friends and
we talked about that and I am the person
[SPEAKER_00]: who did all the beta testing So we took
the first couple purple devices and worked
[SPEAKER_00]: them through our facility in Denver and in
Colorado Springs And all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities that I worked with after the
beta testing got a device as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Arkansas Maine Washington Alaska and
all the different places that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: working in so when I got out of the
Colorado industry Purple was looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: global salesperson and also needed
somebody that was more Cannabis saturated
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess as opposed to it being science and
engineering they wanted to have an aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: that was kind of Core culture cannabis and
that's where I fit in and I've been with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I started with them in 2019 I took
a little bit of time off last year because
[SPEAKER_00]: we had our second kid and then was back at
it again with this year and we've Done
[SPEAKER_00]: everything from the US to Europe to Canada
to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just finished up in Thailand I think
it's safe to say that I'm hoping at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have something in Australia,
but we we kind of focus globally on how
[SPEAKER_00]: many countries we can get it into and
Obviously my background of cultivation and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and nutrients and all the
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how we use it on the sales
aspect One to teach people why they could
[SPEAKER_00]: have a device and also how how best to use
the device and that's Gotten me to where
[SPEAKER_00]: we are today, which is a long strange trip
for sure Wow, what an incredibly extensive
[SPEAKER_01]: range of history you have there and
congrats on the new child recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting You you segue perfectly
and to what I wanted to sort of start with
[SPEAKER_01]: which was how long has the unit been in
development for and what was the sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: process around that like from your
perspective at least So the two gentlemen
[SPEAKER_00]: that started the company They worked with
a different outfit that used near infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: spectroscopy and and I can from here on
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll say an IRS But near infrared
spectroscopy is the actual sensor and what
[SPEAKER_00]: makes the unit work so in layperson terms
There's a tungsten bulb that blinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reflects light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sensor that captures that
reflection An infrared light is not
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we get to see with the
human eye so there's a reflection and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a pattern that gets picked up by this
sensor and because of that reflection and
[SPEAKER_00]: what that sensor picks up that's how it's
able to delineate what Potency moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: content extracts flowers, etc and all that
kind of stuff So there was a company in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015 and 2016 that was using near infrared
spectroscopy and it was hellaciously
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive and had to be kind of kept on a
tabletop and Vibrations and walking didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: work well with it And the two guys that
started purple worked at that company and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of watched it fail and why it failed
one price point To application and also I
[SPEAKER_00]: think a big part of it is not being as
mobile As most people would want it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: so in 2017 they started working on the
purple device Which is about the size of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hockey puck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does fit in a normal pocket or a cargo
pocket It fits in a backpack, etc and the
[SPEAKER_00]: development was at least when I got
Brought in I was contacted because they
[SPEAKER_00]: knew friends of mine in st.
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis and they needed to try to get this
thing on cannabis and they had been
[SPEAKER_00]: working on data models and all of the
engineering and cloud space and and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually make it work with a Device that
was small enough and an app on the phone
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean I was they had done some
testing with cannabis But I was the first
[SPEAKER_00]: person to kind of like really Kick the
tires and do things so we brought it in
[SPEAKER_00]: and within the first week we were trying
to do a hundred tests on it Wrote up some
[SPEAKER_00]: SOPs, you know any flower that would come
out we would test all of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics It also would go to regulated
testing in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would have those lab results that
would come back And that's what I did is I
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of supplied purple with this is what
this lab has said and this is what we
[SPEAKER_00]: found out And then we started getting into
you know, how much more we could do with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously harvested cured flower is great
But there's there's a lot of knowledge in
[SPEAKER_00]: a facility to be able to check something
In week two a flower week for a flower
[SPEAKER_00]: week six a flower and getting into like
phenol hunts and breeding and Keeper
[SPEAKER_00]: selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, you know, how much more data
can we get and and I told purple at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point I was like, you know We have to pay
for our data right now through regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: lab and that could cost us 60 to 80 grand
a year The fact that I can have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: other data that's somewhat free at a
certain point with unlimited testing
[SPEAKER_00]: Allows me to understand certain things
about the facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know We would we could figure out
when we needed to change bulbs We could
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out that in the winter time when it
was colder out We would have a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: higher potency than when the summertime
and it was super hot and we hadn't changed
[SPEAKER_00]: filters in the the heating and air
conditioning units and you can get into
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Hot cold hot corners cold
corners how your irrigation system is
[SPEAKER_00]: working So, you know We noticed plants at
the back of the table weren't getting as
[SPEAKER_00]: much water or plaits at the front of the
table closest to the reservoir We're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a ton of water and we could you
know kind of equate what we could see in
[SPEAKER_00]: The facility with what the potency was
doing and those things were were feedbacks
[SPEAKER_00]: that got back to purple and we had it in I
think at one point we were doing Almost a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred tests a week in four different
states on four different facilities But it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a blessing that some of those
facilities had the same genetics Somehow
[SPEAKER_00]: that they found in their state and put
them in the facility to try to grow Good
[SPEAKER_00]: crops at every one that would have the
same genetic whether it was lemon G or
[SPEAKER_00]: orange mints or cookies and cream Rude boy
OG like a lot of the things that people
[SPEAKER_00]: really wanted to smoke at that time,
which was 2018 to 2020 Kind of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: after the rise of the Jungle Boys and the
orange cookies and a bunch of other things
[SPEAKER_00]: that had occurred on the West Coast Things
had migrated around the country So that
[SPEAKER_00]: was the development in 2019 it went into
actually like public sales and that's when
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of started with them is as the
global sales director was Because all that
[SPEAKER_00]: background in beta testing it was then
well You know I can talk to the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that want to get this whether they're
home-growing or a facility and as I say
[SPEAKER_00]: You know whether it's black white or gray
market the more data you can have the
[SPEAKER_00]: better for any business owner and that's
kind of where it went from development to
[SPEAKER_00]: what it does now and I mean, I think there
are probably over a hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: Different test results in the database It
is ran on a cloud-based system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does work on your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unit can go anywhere So, you know I've
tested stuff in the middle of a field and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tested stuff in a basement and I've
tested stuff In a facility and I've taken
[SPEAKER_00]: it everywhere when I travel at least for
work We always have a device somewhere and
[SPEAKER_00]: now that we can do extracts It's kind of
the same thing that we're testing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin and a lot of hashish and other
things that are happening But I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know, is it At least two and a
half devoted years of development but
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to that they had another two years
of understanding near infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: spectroscopy and kind of how that was a
benefit and here in the states The FDA the
[SPEAKER_00]: Food and Drug Administration has endorsed
near infrared spectroscopy for many
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the amount of hops and beer the amount
of moisture and cat litter the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: so many near infrared spectroscopy Can
literally do anything from counting to
[SPEAKER_00]: reflection?
[SPEAKER_00]: To what we use in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a big thing So most John Deere
tractors have near infrared spectroscopy
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere within them And that's how they
let you know that if you know the tire
[SPEAKER_00]: treads get low or something else is
happening with the device So it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: trained on a lot of different things and
in the states that was kind of the the
[SPEAKER_00]: thought from the science background is
that one it is used in production and two
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a great way to train this device to
Do it for cannabis people that is
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable at that point Yeah,
brilliant what a range of different
[SPEAKER_01]: avenues we could choose to discuss it in I
Totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of infrared spectroscopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it in many different
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a phenomenal technology I
would love to talk about how the unit is
[SPEAKER_01]: set apart from other units because
Whenever I read people discussing the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple, I think that some of the maybe
Points they raised which they think maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: is why they wouldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're they're not correct Most
of them I think there may be quoting
[SPEAKER_01]: aspects of a different unit that they
don't like So for example, I've heard a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people say the purple doesn't give
you real results It's just matching it to
[SPEAKER_01]: a database and I'm like, no, that's that's
not true There's like a white paper online
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can read through it and explains
how it actually works What are some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that set the unit apart from some
of its competitors in your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Though term white paper is definitely from
you know, the science world which I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think Civilians lay people non science
people understand but a white paper is a
[SPEAKER_00]: document that's written goes into peer
review is fact-checked and then after that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's able to be published and it's
Supposed to be rooted in fact for people
[SPEAKER_00]: to know that so that's one thing that we
do at purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little different We do work with
labs all over the country in the states
[SPEAKER_00]: and soon we'll be working with a couple
labs that are in Europe and the white
[SPEAKER_00]: paper that you're referencing I think
talks about there is a variance within the
[SPEAKER_00]: device and there's also a variance of the
device next to UH PLC HP LC's GC's and
[SPEAKER_00]: other equipment that is found in a
regulated testing lab So the variance on
[SPEAKER_00]: the device itself is actually a 10% of the
readout value Which means that if the
[SPEAKER_00]: device reads 20, you're really looking at
like 18 to 24 now contrasting that
[SPEAKER_00]: variance To an HP LC or other device
variances most of them are looking at like
[SPEAKER_00]: a 20% variance and some of that comes down
to calibration techniques and use
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques and how they Dissolve and
homogenize things before it goes into the
[SPEAKER_00]: HP LC or into the UH PLC So with the
purple you grind up the flower the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: sits right on the sensor the light blinks
And it takes a graph of that light when
[SPEAKER_00]: you send something to a regulated lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a person that homogenizes that
Into a solvent and then that gets sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: into the device at a certain point to be
read so there's some other things that
[SPEAKER_00]: happen when you're Diluting or liquefying
something to then have it ran through a
[SPEAKER_00]: different type of system as opposed to
near-infrared So I think that's some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the misconception that people understand
is that a regulated lab is regulated by
[SPEAKER_00]: that state There is no set thing,
you know, like here in the states We talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about it a lot with cars like if you take
your car to an admissions place And they
[SPEAKER_00]: check the emissions all across the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same emissions check That is not
the case in cannabis testing what what's
[SPEAKER_00]: tested in Oklahoma could be different than
what's tested in Colorado can be different
[SPEAKER_00]: than what's tested in Missouri and so I
think the white paper is what we kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: do to Have a little bit of an anchor in
science that allows people to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes This is how the device itself works
and on CBD were less than 1% away from an
[SPEAKER_00]: HP LC and with THC because the number Is
larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at 1.9 percent either way and we
also work with different labs almost every
[SPEAKER_00]: month to calibrate our machine with theirs
and also now we're seeing a lot of labs
[SPEAKER_00]: that want to calibrate their machine with
ours because in the science world
[SPEAKER_00]: near-infrared spectroscopy has a little
bit more of a Stable aspect because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't use solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to homogenize things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a Constant sample that is
put on there and with the purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you grind up the weed You put it in
the sample holder does it you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of people that as soon as
they test that they put that into a bowl
[SPEAKER_00]: and and smoke it so it's not damaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not thrown away That's another thing
I think with the regulated labs that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of changes a little bit is that when you
send them a sample and they do all that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can never really see that sample again
or use it again and I also think a big
[SPEAKER_00]: misconception especially in the states
which I see kind of seeping into other
[SPEAKER_00]: markets right now is that people say
there's no way that that's Right and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like you were saying that it
matched this to a database There's a graph
[SPEAKER_00]: on every single sample that comes out that
is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes There are a hundred thousand other
graphs that we know But every time you
[SPEAKER_00]: calibrate that machine and every time you
put in a new sample That graph is unique
[SPEAKER_00]: from peaks and valleys and where spikes
are and how it all works And I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's also just a lot of people don't
understand near-infrared as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: HPLCs or grass chromatology and all the
other different aspects that happen And
[SPEAKER_00]: you know three years ago regulated labs
could put their foot down and say that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a 30% and everybody would say yeah it
is I think a lot of people know now that
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated labs are gonna say it's 36%
because the client wants to say it's 36%
[SPEAKER_00]: and There's not really a bias with us
We're not in the room running the purple
[SPEAKER_00]: pro for the people like the purple pro is
ran by that person It gives them a number
[SPEAKER_00]: that is unbiased and also I mean,
you know There's not people paying us a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred grand a year to run all of their
samples and I think When you have labs
[SPEAKER_00]: that are for profit, there's a little bit
of human air and bias that kind of comes
[SPEAKER_00]: into some of that So I think that's that's
part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I'll tell you like I tell
everybody You know, you can you can hit up
[SPEAKER_00]: my DM you can hit up my email I talk about
this all day with people but a lot of it
[SPEAKER_00]: is believing is seeing it so I see a lot
of test results from labs and I see a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of test results from purples and I still
to this day I don't think there's a single
[SPEAKER_00]: human that can tell me a 33% THC is
different than a 26% THC in a blind taste
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I see why they do it for sales But
I don't think that there's a human palette
[SPEAKER_00]: they can tell me the difference within 4
to 6% on any now a 12% in the 28% I get it
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people can tell the
difference I have yet to see somebody that
[SPEAKER_00]: could tell me this one is the 32 and this
one is the 28 or something like that Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: some interesting discussion points there
for sure and we'll dive into that a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more I did want to ask you specifically
this was one of the questions I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: ask because Full disclosure to everyone
listening, you know The the crew at purple
[SPEAKER_01]: were kind enough to send me a unit to play
around with and test out so that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about it and I think it's a great
unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence why we're having this chat I found
pretty quickly that some of my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: buds were not testing above like 23% You
know, they were they're in that sweet spot
[SPEAKER_01]: in my mind, which was like sort of 20 to
23 Most of my favorite buds are around
[SPEAKER_01]: there Some of my favorite sativas are
maybe 18 19 a little less but still in
[SPEAKER_01]: that same realm and it got me wondering
You know like what you said a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: 36% tests you read, you know, I just I
can't accept that as truth to be honest So
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to ask you specifically and and
sorry I should add I had that exact same
[SPEAKER_01]: thought you mentioned like when I'm doing
these tests There's no one in the room
[SPEAKER_01]: knows I'm doing these like there's no
reason for me to suspect any bias on
[SPEAKER_01]: purple's part because You like you don't
know who's doing what at any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it made me think You must have seen a
lot of purple tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the highest bud?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've seen tested on purple in terms of
the actual percentage it registered And
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you think is like because you
know, you see labs saying 36 or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the highest percentage you would
just accept as a believable figure before
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have reservations anything could be
that high Yeah, great questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, you know on our flower model
right now, which is about to be updated if
[SPEAKER_00]: it does register over 30% it says Greater
than 30 so we don't do anything
[SPEAKER_00]: technically over 30 I have seen some some
flowers in the past year that have hit
[SPEAKER_00]: that over 30 mark Now I didn't analyze any
samples to see if they had been rolled in
[SPEAKER_00]: key for not I you know, I'm not like
they're showing me a bud It's mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody screenshotting their result and
sending it to us So at that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think whatever they put on that sensor
probably did register over 30 and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: to your point about your favorite buds and
The effect and the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole different universe of
terpenes that kind of interacts with how
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabinoids and the terpenoids work
together and I think that's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: different discussion on My certain things
feel certain ways right like that mercy
[SPEAKER_00]: level of above point three or below point
three and and how that works with Indica's
[SPEAKER_00]: and sativas That's a whole different thing
that I get into a lot when we talk we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to breeders And I think you're right like
most sativas probably register in that 18
[SPEAKER_00]: to 20 22 percent range but they have a
whole different terpene profile that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it a different effect on on a person and I
also think the same about a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica's I think and this is my complete
personal opinion But unfortunately to me
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the stuff that people are smoking
nowadays is a hybrid of some sort There's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a lot of true Indica gene or true
Sativa gene in a lot of the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: people get that they grow so, you know,
there's a lot of seeds being made There's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of genetics out there It's almost
like dogs where I would say 93 percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: them are all mutts of some sort there may
not be pure breads anymore and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that is where the the terpene effect comes
in and and changes a lot of stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: myself I really like citruses and you know
limonene and and all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I enjoy when I smoke and that
gives me a certain effect whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 percent a 22 percent or 28 percent and
I guess the highest value that I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: and and again, this is just after seeing I
Mean I I can probably say in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen at least a quarter of a million
results I may even be able to say I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen a half a million results on different
stuff just because of my work I mean when
[SPEAKER_00]: it when there's stuff that's in that 27 28
range usually if I get to actually see the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, I'm like that's really good,
but and it's mostly because of the green
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb or Cultivator that made it knows
what they're doing with the recipe and
[SPEAKER_00]: their environment I think you could give
that same genetic to somebody else and
[SPEAKER_00]: they would never touch 27.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably hit 22 23 But you can
noticeably see when bud is really good and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can also see like a lot of the
PGR and the stuff that isn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: as as grown Because of a green thumb and
it's more because of what they're thrown
[SPEAKER_00]: in the water I don't see all those PGR is
really topping the charts on a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff now the bud looks great and it's
Super dense feels like a golf ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's what a lot of people make it
into on like that West Coast feel That
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, you know, I would say 24 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that there's probably gonna be
plants that could hit that 30 mark or 30
[SPEAKER_00]: plus mark I know that Hasheesh and
concentrates and you know loud resins and
[SPEAKER_00]: all this different stuff are Hitting,
you know 80 plus 95 plus 99 whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call it on the distillate I mean,
I think there's there's obviously an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in flower potential to be higher
because concentrate numbers are
[SPEAKER_00]: continually getting more stable at a
higher level But me personally,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say most of the stuff that I see a
30 plus percent result I would assume is
[SPEAKER_00]: in that 27 28 range and unfortunately,
I hear all kinds of backdoor stories about
[SPEAKER_00]: You know They take the sample off the
plant from the best plant and they you
[SPEAKER_00]: know run it in the trim bin and rolled
around and keep and send it off to the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: and hitting 34s or the lab is able to let
them know when they haven't Calibrated the
[SPEAKER_00]: device and it's probably best to get in
some samples before we run calibration
[SPEAKER_00]: next week I think that's where the whole
money and the greed and the for-profit
[SPEAKER_00]: messes up a lot of stuff But yeah,
I mean I my personal I you know My sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: spot that I tell everybody is if I if I
can find the right terpene percentage and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's 25 to 27 I you know I would I would
purchase and smoke that weed all day long
[SPEAKER_00]: till the cows come home because I know
that That's the sweet spot for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's different There's some people
that like the florals and the berry
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors some people like the citrus
flavors, you know Anything I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: has that gassy musky kind of East Coast
diesel top to it You know that could be in
[SPEAKER_00]: that 19 to 21 range, but that terpene
profile is gonna give you the effect that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want I think that's that's a
difference on You know how far you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into these genes which you guys at the
podcast do a lot of which is Awesome,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think that you know, everybody
wanting to know a number it's hard to work
[SPEAKER_00]: that number but I Mean, yeah, I would say
the top is you know that 27 to 29 is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume most of the top stuff is
and I think most people sweet spot is you
[SPEAKER_00]: know 23 to 26 that's when you see and I
would say just by means and meetings and
[SPEAKER_00]: how math works That's the most of the weed
that you see you see some great stuff on
[SPEAKER_00]: one end of the bell curve You see some
really bad stuff on the other end and the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that's in the middle is what you're
gonna see the most of Yeah, what a great
[SPEAKER_01]: answer that's um, that's that echoes many
of the real-life experiences I've had I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got a buddy shout out to the garden he he
saw the purple unit you guys gave me and
[SPEAKER_01]: he quickly bought his own and He tested
these his best buds and this guy's a
[SPEAKER_01]: really good grower and it came out at 27%
And I was like, well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's the new highest percentage
I've seen but I believe it because I've
[SPEAKER_01]: tried his bud and it's as you said It's
it's in that top tier where you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting is when I first started
thinking About the unit in theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wondered is this gonna feed the paradigm
of people chasing numbers and then quite
[SPEAKER_01]: shortly after I actually got the unit for
me At least it was the opposite it largely
[SPEAKER_01]: confirmed what I already knew which was
that some of my favorite strains I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: think they were the most potent it was
more about the effect that I enjoyed and
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me it might sound a bit
counterintuitive, but I sort of felt like
[SPEAKER_01]: it it Affirmed to me that I'm not chasing
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The things I like is the things that I
smoke and I say hey This is great and the
[SPEAKER_01]: number never really mattered Do you feel
like that's one of the ways which purple
[SPEAKER_01]: will change the market because I thought
there is a big discussion in the community
[SPEAKER_01]: at the moment about how Not so much like
me and you the real like, you know down
[SPEAKER_01]: the rabbit hole really hectic advocate but
the more average consumer who does walk
[SPEAKER_01]: into a dispensary and just sees numbers,
you know, do you think that we might be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to Change some of the mindset through
showing people that some of the buds they
[SPEAKER_01]: really like may not actually be like 30%
For example, and so like numbers are
[SPEAKER_00]: important, but they're not the be all end
all Yeah, I mean, I think that's at least
[SPEAKER_00]: what we see here There's a lot of states
that start out and the higher percentage
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is sold at a higher price So I
feel like as a customer you're already
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck in that box, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you gonna buy one gram of 20%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna buy two gram of 15%?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean the the decision-making process
at the counter to pace buy something a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary is already kind of slanted that
way unfortunately, and if you knew that
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers weren't a hundred percent true
Maybe that would change your buying
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that within I Would say within
like 30 to 36 months of any state starting
[SPEAKER_00]: you see things start to change from a
supply and demand status, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's more harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more flowers There's more things
available to purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the pricing starts to change and
people have sampled many different things
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's always funny when you
hear about a lot of blue dream or green
[SPEAKER_00]: crack and certain genetics that here in
the states Kind of get like that new
[SPEAKER_00]: starter whatever bad rap You start to
notice that those are the ones that fall
[SPEAKER_00]: in that middle of the road on the potency
But they have the effect that people want
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that that's where the
education comes in is that there are a Lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of brands and companies that are going to
educate customers that it's not about the
[SPEAKER_00]: number it's about the effect and I usually
try to win training or speaking with bud
[SPEAKER_00]: tenders and dispensaries, you know,
it's just like everything else like when
[SPEAKER_00]: you eat Sour cream and onion chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really like sour cream and onion
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the fact that it's the best
potato It's the fact that you like the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profile and I tell a lot of
people, you know I I would tell them to
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase on their nose more than on the
number itself you like how Something
[SPEAKER_00]: smells check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't matter if it's a 20% or a 27%
or a 13% If you like the if you like the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor, you're gonna enjoy that and
there's also this, you know It kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like looms in the background But the
tolerance changes to right as you have
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure to more cannabis your tolerance
changes So anything can knock your socks
[SPEAKER_00]: off when you start but after you know 30
to 36 months of regularly using cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: your tolerance goes up a little bit and
you're purchasing starts to change Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always need something that's at least
20% but smells like gas Well, that may not
[SPEAKER_00]: always be on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got this other one That's 20% but it
smells like cherries and I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that the education of the
customer also changes but unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still a lot of places that sell
based on the number and If the number was
[SPEAKER_00]: backed by some stable concrete
understanding I think it'd be different
[SPEAKER_00]: like when you go and buy a 32 ounce soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always supposed to be 32 ounces some
places May put a lot more ice in it so you
[SPEAKER_00]: get less liquid some places may not put
ice in it So you get more liquid but that
[SPEAKER_00]: cups always 32 ounces, you know,
you could buy a 34% in Oklahoma It's not
[SPEAKER_00]: the same as a 34% in California and it's
not the same as a 34% in Oregon and
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately That's what you know kind of
messes up the buying experience for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people But I would agree that I think
with the purple a lot of people think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be about the number and I and I tell
people that all the time like I get it if
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys want to know the Highest number
and also as a person that knows the device
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get the highest number then
there's a certain way to do that You got
[SPEAKER_00]: to pick the flower on the top with the
most light Penetration and grind that up
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's got to be a cola and you can get
the biggest number But if you want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: real about it, you want to homogenize that
plant So take some lower submittal some
[SPEAKER_00]: tops grind it all up mix it all together
and test that that's gonna give you the
[SPEAKER_00]: average of the plant not what the best one
is now as a grower I always want to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: the best cola that's on the best plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're doing it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the that's the filet mignon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best cut But at a certain point
you run out of that and then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking ground beef and all the hot dogs
and everything else that come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant So might as well know what your
numbers are for the whole thing But I do
[SPEAKER_00]: think that most people to get the purple
that are like yourself or me It's not
[SPEAKER_00]: about trying to get to that 30 plus number
It's about all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like these genetics and this is
what they're coming out at but if I did
[SPEAKER_00]: this in my grow room Could I get 2% higher
or could I get a percent higher?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that educates a lot of
people but I hope it goes away from the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers and I'm a guy that sells a device
that gives you a number so, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's very Contradictory to what I do for
my living but as a cannabis advocate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think numbers are cool for
everybody to understand the data I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's the foundation of the
triangle, you know I think the terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: and the genetics and everything else that
happened I think the potency and that data
[SPEAKER_00]: is something that people need to know and
a lot of people Don't have access to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's that's where it comes
into play But I would agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I don't think numbers are going to be
that important five ten years from now I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's gonna be terpene numbers that
are important or flavonoid numbers that
[SPEAKER_00]: are important or whatever technology comes
out next that can do more To understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant those will continue to be
important at that point Yeah, what a
[SPEAKER_01]: brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I did want to ask you there is a very
healthy community of users who I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know how to phrase this they sort of are
developing their own SOPs for how to test
[SPEAKER_01]: the product it's like, you know,
the hardcore purple fans and Shout out to
[SPEAKER_01]: my buddy plant based 978 Massey.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the one who actually introduced me
to the unit He bought it and he was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey man, this is a cool device Have you
seen it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what sort of stimulated us to
get in touch But he gave me some tips and
[SPEAKER_01]: he said or you know, I when I test samples
I grind them up I put them in the like the
[SPEAKER_01]: little black overlay Holder that you put
on top of the unit to mount it And then he
[SPEAKER_01]: says before I test it, you know I I take
that black unit off and I quickly Give the
[SPEAKER_01]: sensor clean and then I put the black
overlay back on top for people who have
[SPEAKER_01]: the unit They'll know exactly what we're
talking about right now and and it got me
[SPEAKER_01]: Realizing that there are you know people
trying to figure out like the most optimal
[SPEAKER_01]: way to test the samples Do you have a
certain little protocol you run through
[SPEAKER_01]: for how you test the sample and would you
be willing to share?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll run through what I would say I tell
people to do For there's one for home
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and there's one for obviously a
larger facility So on the home growing
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect, but I tell most people to do is
one So the device comes with you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about a black overlay We call that
the sample holder and it lays on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the device and make sure that your sample
is right on the sensor And we say a third
[SPEAKER_00]: of a gram to half of a gram What I will
tell you to do is first on sample prep.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just put a video up on our social media
But you actually want to grind the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis with the funnel pointing up A lot
of people put the funnel right on that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and grind it and it doesn't get as
fine as it needs to So you actually grind
[SPEAKER_00]: with the funnel on the grinder and give
it, you know, five six seven turns get it
[SPEAKER_00]: real fine Then you're gonna put that into
the overlay like you're talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample holder And then I take my pinky and
I just push it down on the top a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit And what that does is it makes sure
that the whole sensor is in contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis now prior to doing This I have
suggested to some people you can use an
[SPEAKER_00]: iso alcohol wipe and give the sensor a
little wipe if you don't want true cross
[SPEAKER_00]: contamination It does come with a brush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just scrub it off if you'd like
but Going into you know science as opposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to non science and as I say it I'm like
there's the science grower and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's the non science grower So for the
science grower, I tell them to calibrate
[SPEAKER_00]: it after they do the ISO wipe every time
go ahead and calibrate It takes another 15
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds, but you know, it's calibrated
It's on a white reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna hit it with an ISO wipe Then
I'm gonna put on the puck which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: calibration puck calibrate it take that
off put on the sample holder Grind it
[SPEAKER_00]: upside down put it in there tap it with
the pinky Put the thing on it and hit run
[SPEAKER_00]: and that would be one complete test right
there now after I run it that one time
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll then run that same sample probably
two or three times and then I'll have Most
[SPEAKER_00]: likely at least two of the same numbers I
may have three different numbers depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on how it all works With our variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm saying is you could get a 20 a
21 and a 19 Well, your average is 20 at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to do those in technically for
science talk It needs to be five seven
[SPEAKER_00]: nine, etc in the cannabis world I tell a
lot of people as long as you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: three You're doing more than one and I
understand everybody's in a hustle to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get stuff done So that would be the
home growing aspect on the large facility
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect We're gonna have them grind up all
their samples and keep them on pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: paper and label all those pieces of paper
And then they're doing an ISO wipe and
[SPEAKER_00]: like every fifth or every tenth test.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna do a calibration again But
after every sample they're gonna do an ISO
[SPEAKER_00]: wipe or some of you use like, you know an
ISO spray bottle and spray it down Same
[SPEAKER_00]: type of thing though before you start
calibrate it your fifth or your tenth or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever Start working in a calibration
step and then you know that the unit has
[SPEAKER_00]: been calibrated after a certain amount of
tests all the time But the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: would come into play we would tell them in
large facilities that you run or want to
[SPEAKER_00]: run each sample Five times record those
five in your database.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can go back and see what it is
And even at that point I get into the an
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect We have a note section in the app
which you know about but we get into some
[SPEAKER_00]: of that coding You know what room number
what row what table what genetic and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to kind of get them into a
standardized aspect so Purple as a company
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have an SOP that we give out with
the device But if you ever contact us
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what you want To have done
with the device we can get in to an SOP
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're talking about
homogenizing crops and doing it that way
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to go at the biggest number
Like I've said before you take the best
[SPEAKER_00]: coal on the top of the biggest plant that
has the most light overlay That's always
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be your biggest potency number And
then you know if you want to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: least potency number which some people are
into Go into your lowers and take some of
[SPEAKER_00]: your popcorn and grind those up and check
those out And then you'll have your top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the mountain and your valley you can kind
of understand how your canopy works within
[SPEAKER_00]: itself But I mean, yeah, if anybody has
any questions that they want to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling sample prep how to use the device
for certain stuff We're always available
[SPEAKER_00]: for those talks and I think you're right
though There there are people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple sample holders So, you know,
they're only going to use the sample
[SPEAKER_00]: holder with one genetic and then take that
off And a lot of the large facilities do
[SPEAKER_00]: that as well They'll buy, you know two
devices and five sample holders and a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of different grinders and there's
somebody cleaning the grinder and doing an
[SPEAKER_00]: ice So wash on that before they do another
one that happens a lot in the lab setting
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, we can even get into how you
got to rinse it out with Three different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of water and all that BS and stuff
that obviously is more scientific But
[SPEAKER_00]: we've dealt with that person in a white
coat all the way down to you know Myself
[SPEAKER_00]: in barefoot with long hair in my own
garden trying to test out what I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do But yeah any of those will work And
depending on what you want to do we we can
[SPEAKER_00]: advise how that may be better or worse On
what you're trying to do for an SOP Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to clarify because you sort of
touched on it Do you know of dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: or grow ops that use the purple as their
primary testing unit and like don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: engage in like say HPLC or GCMS anymore or
you think it's it's more of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: companion tool for other things as well
Well, so I know in the States you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: use third-party regulated testing for your
labeling So I can't say that anybody has
[SPEAKER_00]: replaced that in the regulated lab I do
know in the gray and the black market
[SPEAKER_00]: there are people that are using a purple
and not sending stuff out to testing labs
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore and I do know in the white market
here that there are Probably at least 20
[SPEAKER_00]: off the top of my head that are using it
internally because it's cheaper So they
[SPEAKER_00]: can every harvest, you know, they're only
gonna send the sampling that has to get
[SPEAKER_00]: sampled because it's gonna cost them $400
they're still running a bunch of tests and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably before harvest and after before
harvest At harvest and in the cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our device does measure moisture
content and water activity So here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, there's a term called the
Colorado crunch But if you leave any weed
[SPEAKER_00]: out here, it gets super dry because we're
at six thousand eight thousand feet and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no humidity I mean today I think
outside of my house is like ten percent
[SPEAKER_00]: eight percent humidity So there's a lot of
people that are checking throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: cure Not necessarily for the potency to
rise as it will in curing anyways,
[SPEAKER_00]: but more on that moisture content when
they get down to that 10 to 12 They know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's perfectly cured and they want to
start putting it in their cans To seal it
[SPEAKER_00]: up or putting it in their containers or
their jars or whatever So there are a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of dispensaries in the states currently
that use it as a companion to potency
[SPEAKER_00]: testing Or what we would call like a full
lab test.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to do potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to do microbiobials heavy metals
pesticides Turpenes are not mandatory
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a whole different conversation
But yeah, I mean, there's a lot of them in
[SPEAKER_00]: fact of those 20 I think four or five of
them are multi-state operators that
[SPEAKER_00]: probably amount to 50 plus facilities
across the country and I know that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a device in every one of their facilities
because that's part of what I deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: for work That's fantastic I love that and
you just you've touched on concentrates
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, but you've just mentioned
terpenes now I've heard rumors that
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes are going to be something which
will be able to be tested in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you able to test?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us any more about that or is it under
lock and key?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's somewhat lock and key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So We we have an extract model that will
come out with the same device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a software update We also
have a new update coming on the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: which will be about potency and other
things that it can do In the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I can say is that
Unfortunately, the terpene testing will
[SPEAKER_00]: not happen with near infrared spectroscopy
because of the viscosity And the liquid of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes does not reflect that well So it
would be a different device.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people can Understand
with that sentence that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things being looked at I think there are
things that could be developed But
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, it won't be the purple pro
that would do the terpenes It would be a
[SPEAKER_00]: different thing that would have to do the
terpenes and same when we get into Heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals and pesticides like when you're
working on parts per billion with
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides and the regulated testing That
reflection isn't really there But I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: say, you know as a full-blown turp head
that I am and what I love to do There's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of talks on how a new device or new
technology would be able to do terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know, it's not under lock and key
that much because I'll talk about it But
[SPEAKER_00]: it is under lock and key that it won't be
the purple pro and I don't know how fast
[SPEAKER_00]: that will occur either Mostly because
technologies to measure terpenes Have not
[SPEAKER_00]: been found to be mobile and small enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean like The purple pro itself is
about the size of a hockey puck The
[SPEAKER_00]: coaster that you put your drink on if it
was an inch and a half tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about that size And so there's some
limitations with technology to do terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're still trying to work out So I
think if I can say that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: work it out I know something's hopefully
coming at some point in the in the future,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it won't be the near future That's
great to hear I know a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_01]: very much keen to hear more about that I
am I wanted to ask you about one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most interesting things from a private
discussion We had last time we spoke was
[SPEAKER_01]: how you were talking to me about how the
unit can be used for phenohunting And as
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who does a lot of phenohunting and
a bit of breeding myself I was really keen
[SPEAKER_01]: to hear more because that sounds like
revolutionary What sort of role do you see
[SPEAKER_01]: the unit playing and how have people used
it to aid in their phenohunts that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of?
[SPEAKER_00]: So The biggest the biggest way I can
describe it in phenohunting is that and
[SPEAKER_00]: and from a breeding life and project and I
mean I've been involved with Tens and tens
[SPEAKER_00]: I can maybe say a hundred but definitely
over fifty different breeding projects in
[SPEAKER_00]: my previous stuff with purple I've worked
on probably ten or twelve But with
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunting obviously we're looking for a
keeper or we're looking for multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers And before it used to be a couple
different, you know little columns that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to check Yeah, it has bag
appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it matures fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it has weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it has good color but in
phenohunting there weren't a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that were actually Able to access data on
potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing with the the purple pro
was alright You just finished a phenohunt
[SPEAKER_00]: and these are the ten that you wanted to
keep based on the other criteria let's
[SPEAKER_00]: test them and get you a number to see
where they at and Mostly like we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about at the beginning of this Most of the
people are finding out that the ones they
[SPEAKER_00]: really like are, you know 20 to 24 and so
they probably had some 28 29s and 27s that
[SPEAKER_00]: they threw away because maybe it didn't
have back appeal Maybe it wasn't color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it didn't yield the most and I will
say specifically not yielding as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: other parents Does have some indication on
potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why it is but less buds
usually means more potency and more buds
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes means less potency for some
reason Within how the plant does all of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we started in 2019 and
that was on a phenohunt that I ran with a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of genetics from an orange mince
line that we created With a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_00]: really great stuff from the female side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point we were like,
alright Well now obviously when we run a
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunt we're gonna have to keep all
these seeds and we're gonna have to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: every one and test them to figure out
which one is the keeper because If we're
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing away high potency, who knows what
else we're throwing away with The ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that we didn't keep because you're only
keeping 10 out of 200 or 5 out of 100 or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever So the next round that we went
through was with an outside source and a
[SPEAKER_00]: very good friend of mine that's here in
the states and what we started doing is we
[SPEAKER_00]: started testing samples in week 2 week 4
week 6 week 8 and what we could see is
[SPEAKER_00]: with the purple pro device you can start
to see CBG translate into THC and CBD so
[SPEAKER_00]: week 2 there's not a lot going on and
we're I mean literally Drying out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a couple leaves grinding them up
doing it whatever by the time we got to
[SPEAKER_00]: week 4 We started to see little bits of
THC showing up throughout the phenohunt by
[SPEAKER_00]: week 6 we were able to see most of them
But also how the numbers correlated,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like hey, you know seed number
17 Is that 6% already in week 6 but seed
[SPEAKER_00]: number 10 is only a 2 Well, do we want to
keep the 2 is the 2 magically gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, you know by week 6 week 8 you're
starting to see real numbers by week 8 if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to go into 10 and 12 and all that
stuff with your sativas You start to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of other stuff going down So now
through those projects what what we have
[SPEAKER_00]: understood and the last application that
we did was we did a 400 seed hunt with a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding company and By week 6 we were
able to get them from 400 seeds down to
[SPEAKER_00]: 150 seeds So what this did was save on
water save on nutrients save on labor save
[SPEAKER_00]: on light space and by week 8 we were down
to like about 60 or 70 seeds total of the
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 and then they wanted to grow those out
through completion and by saving space
[SPEAKER_00]: labor nutrients and everything else They
were able to take a previous phenohunt
[SPEAKER_00]: that they had done and started to work
those seeds faster So the room that had
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 seeds and now only has 60 or 70 seeds
has room for Your gen 3 of whatever line
[SPEAKER_00]: to be tested and grown out by the 10 that
you're trying to keep there my cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: background I was like Well, you know more
importantly than anything if we can just
[SPEAKER_00]: save you on water and labor and you go
from 400 seeds to 80 seeds That's fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's what we need to do So I don't
think there's you know a huge way to
[SPEAKER_00]: change a lot of that stuff But that's
that's how it goes on how it can work in
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunting is that not only can we save
actual dollars but we're able to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the projects as fast as possible
so that you can work on things faster and
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find a real keeper with a potency
now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you you look at a lot Of those seed
packaging and they have a potency number
[SPEAKER_00]: on them And also they say how fast they're
gonna mature I mean if they haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: tested and they don't know a lot of those
numbers Don't don't have they don't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just put on there to fill space
Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Had one last question for you before we
wrap up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I wanted to ask you because I think
anyone who's got a purple will probably
[SPEAKER_01]: have discovered this same thing There are
a bunch of really weird high production
[SPEAKER_01]: quality smear ads for purple online and
it's and it's so it's so weird because
[SPEAKER_01]: like you can tell it's like Bullshit,
but it seems like there's so much money
[SPEAKER_01]: been put into making these ads or maybe
I'm giving them too much credit But it's
[SPEAKER_01]: so odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will ask is this is this one of the tea
bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: Videos that's from Canada because that's
one of the ones I hear about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, it made me think is this some
disgruntled employees?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's and and the claims they make
a ludicrous like there's ones on YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's like someone's like I owned a
dispensary and bought ten pounds of CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: bud because the purple said it was THC and
it's and it's just these weird shit We
[SPEAKER_01]: like well wouldn't you like that's just on
you mate?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a stupid statement to make right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm interested in is it seems
like it's very much like a Targeted
[SPEAKER_01]: campaign and maybe from like a company
like a competitor or something like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very off-putting like what's the deal with
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So originally what had happened Is that in
Canada there was a podcast of video cast
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had put some Lipton iced tea or
something on the device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously we We spent years testing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't put You know grass from your lawn
and a bunch of other stuff on there So
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a video of putting some Lipton
tea on there and it read out that it had
[SPEAKER_00]: THC in it and I guess you know from from
our science core They're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, if you know it's Lipton iced tea,
you know that I mean that doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that you're trying to test Cannabis
and see what's up with that or hemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know one of the two so that that video
definitely went I would say somewhat viral
[SPEAKER_00]: and it wasn't from any Competitor there is
there is no disgruntled employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: We only have like six employees total So
it's not that aspect, but I do know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are people that make other devices
They grab that video and kind of ran with
[SPEAKER_00]: it And I do know that there are some
competitors that I'll never waste time
[SPEAKER_00]: naming But they they have put a lot of
money into it And I think you know in
[SPEAKER_00]: internally a purple what I tell everybody
I'm like, hey people are trying to hack
[SPEAKER_00]: you down and people are trying to do that
Obviously something's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, we have thousands of
devices out across the whole entire globe
[SPEAKER_00]: that are doing something But every now and
then you have one of those little that'll
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up The funniest one about the one that
you mentioned about buying the 10 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: of CBD is that in Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently there's 50 different coffee
shops just in Amsterdam that use it
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout their purchasing process every
single day for that exact reason that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to buy CBD so about a year ago
there was an influx of this hemp and CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: flower that they were trying to sell to
coffee shops in Amsterdam and our European
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor who does an unbelievable job
Started coming in and they're like no
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll test it for you now We'll test it
for you and that eventually made every
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee shop pretty much buy one and all of
that CBD heavy hemp flower Then started to
[SPEAKER_00]: migrate down to Spain because they were
trying to sell it to coffee shops in
[SPEAKER_00]: Barcelona everywhere else So those people
that own those businesses and the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that own the businesses in Amsterdam talk
all the time So a lot of the places in
[SPEAKER_00]: Barcelona all have a purple as well before
they buy anything They test it on there
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's because there's nowhere else to
test anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Amsterdam, there's no regulated labs
in Spain There's no regulated labs in
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no regulated labs They use the
purple pro not as like a mandatory
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated lab, but they do use it for
their purchasing power So they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, man, you know, this is only 8% I'm
not paying you the same As the guy that
[SPEAKER_00]: just brought us the 16% but I will I will
tell you, you know the the I think it is
[SPEAKER_00]: it is funny that they're considered smear
ads or etc Because a lot of the people
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to me about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like dude, I saw this crazy video Like
what's up with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you work at purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is the perfect time for me to
tell you about the purple pro now So I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's backfired in that realm But the
tea bag when is is a funny one just
[SPEAKER_00]: because like I tell people it's not if you
put a cucumber on there Like what did you
[SPEAKER_00]: did you smoke the cucumber?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know What it is it's about human
logic and then it's about device logic And
[SPEAKER_00]: the device is not supposed to tell you
what everything is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna tell you what a banana
plant is It's gonna tell you what what
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or hemp is because that's
obviously what it's been developed to do
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is it is a it is a really funny
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say probably once every two weeks
Somebody that I'm speaking with wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask me about it and and same thing like
with what you just brought up I'm like I
[SPEAKER_00]: got no issue talking about it Like soon as
you get a purple pro in your hand You'll
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what you want to believe but I
will say there is some unbelievable
[SPEAKER_00]: production and editing that they've put
into those videos I mean, they they look
[SPEAKER_01]: like they're really nice videos for sure
Yeah, it's so It's so weird because it
[SPEAKER_01]: feels like to me is such a backfire like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The videos are so disingenuous it's
obvious from the word go and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: like yeah, it's just like Fuck get someone
from like PR on your team because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: not a good PR move for the the company
Trying to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just yeah, it's so unbelievable that
it makes you want to go get the purple and
[SPEAKER_00]: try it out I feel like it's it's so
far-fetched.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like I got to see this for
myself It's like when you watch a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy shit on TV and you're like,
there's no way it's that bad And then you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go grab it's it's it's an
interesting tactic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean I I hear about them I see
the funniest part is is that I mean I have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of friends in the cannabis industry
in the states and so I get sent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know DMs or texts They're all like
dude, you've seen this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the craziest I've ever seen I'm
like, yeah, man And then literally like
[SPEAKER_00]: the next thing is like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy wants to buy one of those I
forgot to hit you up last week and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like, alright, well, let's get him a
purple pro It's it's it is hilarious to
[SPEAKER_00]: me, but I would agree with you It's you
know, somebody's putting some time and
[SPEAKER_00]: effort into that I just don't think it's
working out the way they want to Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: hugely hugely.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that old saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Focus on building your castle rather than
knocking others down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah Glad to hear it did strike me
as a poor business decision on their part
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever, you know, it brings eyes to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it I think that pretty much runs over
most things I wanted to chat about with
[SPEAKER_01]: you today Was there anything you wanted to
touch on that we haven't mentioned so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I think the biggest thing,
you know from from my background and what
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to do Like, you know, if you're if
you're on the fence about trying to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: something Try some out and grow something
you got to kill a lot of plants before
[SPEAKER_00]: you're ever gonna grow 27% or 29% So,
you know The further the further you get
[SPEAKER_00]: down that journey the better the fruit
gets and you got to start the journey at
[SPEAKER_00]: some point so, you know, I hope everybody
can Can get as involved as they want to if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just a smoker then that's great,
too If you want to try to figure out if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a green thumb It's a whole
different rabbit hole that you can explore
[SPEAKER_00]: just like anything else in life You know,
there's gear and there's genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's what time of year is best and
there's outdoor and there's indoor But
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I mean, you know, I would say my
parting words are not necessarily just
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect But anything and everything you
can do to grow more cannabis on the planet
[SPEAKER_00]: is is kind of the goal on what all the
forefathers in this industry wanted to see
[SPEAKER_00]: happen So, you know put a seed in the
ground and see what you can do a Beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: sentiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again huge Thank you to John from
purple scientific for joining us today to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about the purple Pro and just as a
final one if people were keen to give the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple Pro a try What do you recommend
they do to make that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple different ways if you
just want to talk about it, you can hit me
[SPEAKER_00]: up on Instagram It's at Grammy Gatsby GRI
MEY GATSBY It'll come up, you know Hit me
[SPEAKER_00]: up drop me a DM if you want to talk about
what you're doing or how you think it may
[SPEAKER_00]: be best used If you are at the point where
you do want to just purchase one WWW get
[SPEAKER_00]: purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no e on purple comm is where we
sell them You know, I hope that at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point we'll have some people down in
Australia that will be selling them and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can come down there and visit but I mean
anywhere that you're are wherever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: listening if you Want to talk about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know if you do want to purchase one
we can get you taken care of somewhere But
[SPEAKER_00]: that'd be the the easiest way to try to
grab one if you want to and you know If
[SPEAKER_00]: there's four or five people listening and
that are all buddies You guys can all go
[SPEAKER_00]: in and grab one and see how it works or
test it out And I mean it's it comes in a
[SPEAKER_00]: in a Pelican case hard case with
everything in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pass it around You know here in
the States croptober is coming So there's
[SPEAKER_00]: about to be a lot of flowers to test in
the next couple months, which I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: stoked to see Jump on her if you're
interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been enjoying mine a lot So once
again big shout out John.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have it friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely go check out the purple pro on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a look at the unit and see if it
interests you As always a huge shout out
[SPEAKER_01]: to our sponsors seeds here now simply
souvenirs Copic biological systems pulse
[SPEAKER_01]: sensors and the one and only patreon gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love you guys so much That's about it
for this one friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you for the next one Oh You You
You You
