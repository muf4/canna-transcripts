[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back, my friends, for part two of
the epic chat we had with Mean Gene of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino, talking all things breeding,
history, trends for the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you can expect going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further ado, let's get started.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: RKS Rosam, that is a question for the
ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, what a brilliant answer as to
how to sort of work a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone, including myself,
will need to re-listen to that once or
[SPEAKER_00]: twice because there's just gold in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking of working a line,
I've always been very fond since being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to try your cherry pie S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's got to be one of the most
intoxicating flavor profiles there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always followed the cherry west
and just in general, your cherry work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that there's a lot of really
cool projects you've been doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: be it like, you know, the cherry west back
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing the collab with Bio Vortex,
the cherry lime dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were chatting to him with about that
and that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I even noticed that you did a sunset
sherbet cherry limeade cross, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: also cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any immediate plans for what
you want to kind of do with your cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any ideas where you want to go in the
future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know a lot of people beyond
myself are really into them and follow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, so I have some different
things that I've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I even this year I took a,
you know, the lime and the cherry limeade
[SPEAKER_01]: is the PK black lime, which was the
brother of the lime one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I made the cherry limeade with
that mail, I also put that on the lime
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have various lime lines that
come out of that, but I just call lime
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of black lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this year I took a lime,
a really nice lime F5 and I put that on
[SPEAKER_01]: the cherry clone again to remake a cherry
limeade F1, which is the same thing I did
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the cherry lime pop, which was
when I used the lime pop mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was a lime F2 instead of an F5.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what Biovortex started with for
his project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went ahead and did a different
one and it'll be a little bit different
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, the lime pop was what
it was and the mail I used this time is
[SPEAKER_01]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the F1 lime mail that I used to make
cherry limeade was its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you do that, you pick a
different mail of the same strain and you
[SPEAKER_01]: put it on the same mother, you get a
completely different cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, you know, it's not just like you
take lime and cherry, you cross them
[SPEAKER_01]: together and you get the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you use a different mail,
you get a completely new thing with some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the same traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went ahead and I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a lot of cherry lime cross gelato,
gelato 33.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed kind of silly when I made it,
but I tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I grew them, I was like,
wow, this really worked out nice because
[SPEAKER_01]: it was, they had really pretty color,
which, you know, who cares, but still
[SPEAKER_01]: they're pretty and nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made it a little bit more substantial
and dense than a lot of the cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: limeades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though the cherry limeade has that in
it, they're not all super heavy and dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And easy to trim, but the gelato really
brought that to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cherry limeade still kept a lot of its
turps in there that really popped out and
[SPEAKER_01]: made it sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas gelato is more kind of like a kind
of the 33 is kind of like a fruit loopy
[SPEAKER_01]: ice cream thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so I took that and I did that on
a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the cherry limeade gelato,
I put it on the cherry mom again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll reinforce that cherry-ness,
but the lime will start to get lost a
[SPEAKER_01]: little.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the lime in those, in the cherry
limeade crosses because it brings some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that citronella, lemongrass, lime peel
kind of stuff, which the cherry already
[SPEAKER_01]: had some of it, but it's more like star,
more like lemon starburst candy kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the cherry, so the cherry,
the cherry west back cross was cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: limeade cross cherry west cross cherry
west.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that male got put on the cherry west
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then out of that, that got put on the
cherry west again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have quite a few seeds now of the
cherry west back cross three instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: one, which was the last release.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll probably come out of that and go
back to it again, which is eventually just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of making that cherry west clone by
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you could have taken cherry
west, the original males from that seed
[SPEAKER_01]: and put it on the clone and taken those
forward, except the cherry limeade,
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked better in the cross because it had
more of the crazy far out turps that the
[SPEAKER_01]: cherry west 10 clone had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas a lot of the sisters of the cherry
west 10 and the cherry west cross,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were more of a plain cherry pie thing
and like regular cherry pie and as exotic
[SPEAKER_01]: as regular cherry pie is and people really
like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like the cherry pie weirdo that I
have from clone, which is a lot more rose
[SPEAKER_01]: oil and that starburst candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thing going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to, I like to use that to lock
down the cherry west in seed form,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cherry limeade instead, because the
males, I feel like the cherry west 10 was
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like a one and whatever 50 throw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rest, some of the rest were a
little more dumbed down, regular cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: pie turps, which are a little more musky
and deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dark, which are cool and tasty,
but not the unique thing I was trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring out of both those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I liked the cherry lime better as
to, as a starting place for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I've been doing with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so I'll probably put out like,
I might put out some cherry west back
[SPEAKER_01]: cross three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might just wait and put out the back
cross four or the back cross back cross
[SPEAKER_01]: one F twos or the back cross three F twos,
just depending, you know, we'll try them
[SPEAKER_01]: and see which ones kind of are the coolest
or, you know, do them all if they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool and different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you saw was the cherry west back
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we smoked when you were here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was funny because we kind of took
the one we thought was the worst and we
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked that and I was like, shit,
this shit's still good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you guys wouldn't even be that
stoned because you had a heavy tolerance
[SPEAKER_01]: and I didn't as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was sitting there super ripped
and I was like, look, I'm probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: only one high here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you guys were like, dude,
that's stony.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, all right, cool,
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see, you know, like out of that,
since it was the one that didn't look like
[SPEAKER_01]: it was the best, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so there's those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did, you know, I kind of,
I want to find like a cherry lime made
[SPEAKER_01]: that can actually make like water hash,
bubble hash, because it is so greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only really make, you can really
only make oil with like butane or CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just doesn't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, I want to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see the same turps on a more
solid resin head so that you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: different stuff with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I crossed it like with, with Chrome's
white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I crossed it with Katsu Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I crossed it with Black Dog and I
crossed it with Purple Snow Bubba from
[SPEAKER_01]: CSI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in an attempt to see if I can
go in a direction where I get the cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: lime made turps on a more solid resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see if that works out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think if there's other stuff
I did, but those, I think that's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: what, what I really have going now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, I did cherry lime made
cross with the cherry clone again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took the F5 cherry lime made and put
that on the cherry clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was watching Game of Thrones and
they had the guy who was the fire guy and
[SPEAKER_01]: they called him the pie romancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, ooh, cherry pie romancer,
cherry pie, cherry pie romancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to fucking call it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I slapped that on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I knew, I knew it came out of a
funny, it's hard to name things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, but also, you know, that's a funny
thing cause it's fire and there's pie in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was like one thing that I have and
I'm going to keep working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other cherry stuff, cherry lime made,
I have a lot of F6s that I need to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through different directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go back to the oldest ones
while they're still viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can make lots of them to put into
storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you kind of successful with your
newer ones, you don't want to abandon the
[SPEAKER_01]: old ones cause that's where you found the
good shit, you know, in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to make more of those before
they get old and maybe find new crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the wild strawberry clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one I call cherry lime four from
back cause that was cherry lime four,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was my original F1 keeper of cherry
lime made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I hit that with seeds from in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I popped those, I got one
that just has the craziest turps and it
[SPEAKER_01]: got some balls in my debt, but it didn't
seed itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm doing a bunch of crosses
with that and seeing if I can kind of get
[SPEAKER_01]: that to go in a direction where it'll
straighten out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one's like really, really crazy
lemongrass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to describe citronella chemical
with some of the starburst from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cherry, but mostly just very limey,
but the special part of the cherry without
[SPEAKER_01]: any of the berry cherry smell to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think that's kind of,
you know, that's kind of where those are
[SPEAKER_01]: at at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of like still hunting
through and trying different stuff with
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always have different, you know,
outcrosses I did with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's a lot of neat stuff
that pops out of those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it sounds like there's a variety
of different avenues people can go down if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're interested in exploring the cherry
work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that name, the cherry
pyromancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nice little pun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed in that question, you referenced
having done some work with gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had picked up on that as well,
looking through your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was wondering, do you like the
results you see having used the gelato
[SPEAKER_00]: mother in some crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: And does this give any sort of credence to
the idea that maybe some of the hype boys
[SPEAKER_00]: one day will see a Runts cross from me and
Gene?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I took that gelato 33 cherry
limeade and I grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got the Runts clone and I grew
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the Runts when I grew it,
it kind of had a cool shape to it where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of bud to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the leaf's kind of separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked a lot like my old dirt perp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I lost that years ago, kind of a
narrow bud that wants to kind of hug
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you take the leaves off of it,
it's just kind of the buds left there and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not hairy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had really pretty color even in the
middle of the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, of course, now everybody knows
gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows Skittles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm of the opinion that if we would
have had all this same quote unquote hype
[SPEAKER_01]: shit in the mid 90s, we would have been
like, this is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like so and so's shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I feel like any time you win,
everybody says you're full of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like an aspect of underdog
stuff that happens where as soon as a
[SPEAKER_01]: strain is popular, it's really hard for
people to not say it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like like ChemDog maybe and OG have
been able to kind of be big and popular
[SPEAKER_01]: purely for the reason that they're like
straight up probably the most knock you in
[SPEAKER_01]: the head shit that anybody has access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody who's really into those sees
anything that's not as potent and goes,
[SPEAKER_01]: ah, that shit's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you smoke the most potent weed all
the time, anything that's not the most
[SPEAKER_01]: potent weed doesn't really do much to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for me, I'm like, well, I don't
really want to just smoke one kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't even really want to smoke
ChemD, Chem 91 and Ghost OG every day,
[SPEAKER_01]: all day, all the time, because then when I
smoke other shit, I won't really get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went through the same thing when we
started smoking hash all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'd smoke a joint and we'd be
like, yeah, I'm fucking just don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: bother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just smoke some fucking hash because
this isn't doing nothing to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I kind of like to keep what I'm
smoking varied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that way, when I smoke something
that's super potent, I really get fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: ripped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I can notice it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've smoked the most potent shit every day
all day that I have available.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a certain point, every time you
smoke, you don't really get high anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you kind of go, oh, this is the
one thing that no matter what,
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets me high every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like, yeah, kinda, but not like
you would be if you smoked Urkel for a
[SPEAKER_01]: week and then you smoked some fucking OG
or Chem 91 or Chem D, then you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: ooh, fuck, okay, I'm fucking rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to switch shit up and even be on
the high of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to taste the same weed every
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only a couple kinds of weed that I
like so much because they make me happy
[SPEAKER_01]: and I like how they taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I get really into them where I wanna
smoke them all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to have, I don't mind that
there's a Runtz or a Gelato or a Cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: Pie or whatever it is because for me,
it's like, those are all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: things that to me are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they are something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking, I love pizza or burgers and
fries or sushi or fries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love fucking whatever nice, light Thai
food, Japanese food, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there might be something that I like
better than everything else or only two
[SPEAKER_01]: things, but I don't really wanna eat that
shit every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that I got access to a lot
of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like my favorite song.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wanna just listen to it all the
time or pretty soon I'm like, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, it's kinda played out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way I think of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like all the variety and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, yeah, I got the Runtz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking bred it with the Gelato,
Cherry, Limeade.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see if it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bred it with the Sky Cuddler Double Kush
because I thought that would be odd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there might be stuff that comes out of
it that isn't like what a normal Runtz
[SPEAKER_01]: cross would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like a Kush that's kind of a
weird Kush with a Runtz.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, okay, well be kinda neat if
you get like a gnarly stony OG bud that
[SPEAKER_01]: smells a little bit like Gelato or
something or something that you wouldn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: it unlocks something that you didn't get
out of either parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried it, see what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've always done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if there's something that people say
is really good and like I have friends who
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it and they're like, oh no dude,
it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, yeah, it's not just fucking,
it's not just some bullshit that's
[SPEAKER_01]: popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I like to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If one of my friends says like they're
into it, I'm like, cool, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make some crosses and if they're good,
they're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if not, they just go in a fucking pile
of all the other shit I never do anything
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it every, I do it every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever is something that's around that
people say is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, huh, I wonder how it breeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder how it looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder what it looks like when I grow
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or when I, you know, like what's it like
the way I dry it or handle it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like is it good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it not good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, let's see what it does
because you know, originally like I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: like OG and we even had types of weed that
were so similar to OG back in the old
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were like, I don't know,
you smoke it, it's really fucking strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really feel that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just feel really fucking stoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get giggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really get any kind of,
you know, like it doesn't give you a lift.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, it's fucking, holy shit,
that's potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't really ever like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that became really popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started smoking tons of fucking
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden it was like,
okay, this shit's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I liked those kinds of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, what one person likes
doesn't mean that's the best for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to try to keep everything going
and make something out of stuff when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes around, if I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially like if it does good in
like blind competitions with real heads,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like the Eagle Clash or the
Emerald Cup or whatever, where people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know the name, but everybody's like,
damn, this one's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be that fucking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be that fucking bad if it's,
if this is blind, it ain't the Mylar bag
[SPEAKER_01]: selling it to people in a jar when there's
no name on it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it makes me curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do stuff with everything,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Agent Orange crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Runtz crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got fucking Big Bud crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got Northern Lights crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you name it, whatever came around
that at the time was something that people
[SPEAKER_01]: thought were cool and people who I respect
thought it was good dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fucking hit it with some Pauling,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good philosophy to have for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure all the hypebeasts will be
thrilled to hear that they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get the Runtz Gelato Cherry
Limeade combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Sky Cuddler one also sounds like
it could be a cool little hybrid in the
[SPEAKER_00]: works there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on that same topic of catering to
everyone, I was so stoked to see that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting some nice sativas in the
mix recently when I noticed that you put
[SPEAKER_00]: up that post about having pollinated a C5
plant you had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got me thinking, are you planning
on, you know, working or maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing some of the older sort of haze
hybrids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that although there are a
lot of people who say that they're super
[SPEAKER_00]: sick of, you know, the Amsterdam turf
profile, like that meme you put up
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly embodied it where you are kind
of alluding to that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a more nuanced side of the haze
terpenes, which people can sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: discredit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your plans for this hybrid?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you want to do some more sativa
work going forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the thing about sativas was for
me, my thing was always I wanted to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to make plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to be able to make seeds that
somebody that somebody like, I'm a funny
[SPEAKER_01]: person like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't have a whole lot of stuff
that I like just for the sake of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to do things for other people's
enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I really like to make plants that I
think someone else is going to like to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I always kind of did stuff
that I knew like people, cause I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: used to, you know, be on the internet and
nobody knew that I had anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know anybody outside my little
circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like, okay, well I think
so and so, you know, they know this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and we all thought it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I'm going to work on it and then,
you know, see if we can get some people to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow some of this and that'll be fun to
see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to make something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's going to grow that I'm just going
to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, that's kind of the fun of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're going to make music.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make music that people are
going to want to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make food that when you feed
people, they'll think it's good food,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I always kind of just was doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at a certain point I realized
that I do like just for myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: I do really like the highs on some of the
Sativa stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had some Swazi and some stuff
people gave me and way back in the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: we had like a tie that would completely
like be like half male, half female,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the weed was really tasty on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd say, fuck it and put,
you know, one way over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And grow them and have a, you know,
a couple of joints off a little plan or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my buddy had some Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: He brought back from Mexico and grew it
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh, that's, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they grew terribly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just like, you know,
it's just a novelty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I realized at a point, okay,
I do like to have a little bag of this
[SPEAKER_01]: Swazi or a little bag of whatever it is,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I've grown some Swazi,
some Congolese and I, I, I, I realized
[SPEAKER_01]: that you don't have to grow plants to have
a crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow plants just to have one
little shitty plant and a little pot off
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere to the side and just take that
and you wind up with a little bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every once in a while you're like,
ah, I'm gonna smoke the weird weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you take five bong hits of the really
weird weed with the high ceiling and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really fucking high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's different than anything else,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives you, it gives you cool,
gives you cool vibes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not just smoking the same Afghani
based stuff that is good for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things, but doesn't necessarily give you
the real fucking lift of being tripped out
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I, I got the C5,
I got the A5, I tried the weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both have a really cool high.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant itself smells like lemon peels,
which I think is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bud really has that kind of
Amsterdam, haze when you have that
[SPEAKER_01]: turpentine like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sharp and like turpentine and
gnarly like, so like the, like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Pakistani CSI has like where it's more
earthy too is a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so I, you know, I went ahead
and crossed it with stuff that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of potential for
different terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we'll see if it goes
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to have a lot of those
seeds, but enough to try some out,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm more interested in working with
like this Malawi I have and this
[SPEAKER_01]: Congolese.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Congolese is kind of in that ballpark,
but it has more of a deep grassy thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: it that you would think you wouldn't like
if you don't like those types.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of just nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have any Hermes in them and
they were straight from straight from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Congo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like they were, they were good for
that kind of a, like a land race heirloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: African thing and really hardy in a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, just, I want to play
with some different things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not the, it's not the main
direction I want to go, but I really would
[SPEAKER_01]: like to get my hands on the old haze type
that I saw in the nineties where it was
[SPEAKER_01]: just so tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was more like a, I don't know,
like a, I don't know, really hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: describe, but more like cedar incense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're just like, damn, that is so
enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, more like how like as funny as
it is, like opium straight off of a,
[SPEAKER_01]: off of the head of a poppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you smoke that, how it's just,
we're just like, wow, so that's just made
[SPEAKER_01]: to be smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not like smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a whole, whole different
thing, you know, which is what a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the best weed strains are like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, you can't believe it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to dig into those kinds of
things more.
[SPEAKER_01]: The A5 and the C5 are really famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville, you know, like you can't downplay
his, his legacy and you know, like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Lights I was talking about
earlier probably was straight from Neville
[SPEAKER_01]: based on the packaging and the labeling
and shit timeframe.
[SPEAKER_01]: The C5 was really cold resistant,
really moisture resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The A5 has a taste that I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody who's chasing those as
being really amazing, like definitely try
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good answer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess as a followup kind of based on
how you said you'd love to get some like
[SPEAKER_00]: real haze and maybe as a larger extension,
this applies to the roadkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that there are really many,
if any growers who are, shall we say like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hidden up away in the hills or
the mountains still holding onto some
[SPEAKER_00]: super old cultivar from years gone by and
like the, you know, late eighties or
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think maybe not so likely
because even those people who are tucked
[SPEAKER_00]: away still come into town every so often
and they get exposed to the new stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: they probably dropped it at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think real heads have certain plants
that they're just in love with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they keep them no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they maybe share them with
a couple of people who know how good they
[SPEAKER_01]: are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there's probably a lot of
stuff out there that you'll never hear
[SPEAKER_01]: about because I think in general,
you know, like even me, like I,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes I don't even understand why I
have any interest with like really
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and sharing seeds and like the
whole scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I even, you know,
just trying to keep up with the social
[SPEAKER_01]: interactions and the way everything goes
and, you know, the whole scene,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm relatively new to compared to a
lot of people who have been more
[SPEAKER_01]: interested into it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had a certain naivety with the
whole scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, initially, like I met
people who were super into seeds and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, I never, you know, I don't know
anybody who's really into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends are like hardcore, you know,
old school dope growers who they,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they get the good thing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get the good thing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they have something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a little seeds here and there
and stuff and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was people who were super
into it and I was like, whoa, these people
[SPEAKER_01]: really into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over time you realize,
well, yeah, the reason why they're into it
[SPEAKER_01]: is because of the way the scene is laid
out where you can manipulate people so
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily by being Mr. Seed guy or whatever
little role that they're playing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: scene, you know, and then after a while
you're like, oh, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: y'all don't even really, I don't even know
if you really like any of this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know if you have any
interest in the biology or the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect beyond the clout and all this other
kind of bullshit that like surrounds
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that is, you know, an opportunity
to gain any kind of like that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: energy like, you know, there's some people
who are really, they really love cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew up from when they were a little
kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh, you know, my dad or my
uncle and my grandpa or whatever was in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I learned about the paint and I
learned about the transmission and I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned about the engine and I know
everything about all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, probably at a car show,
there's probably like maybe half of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people are like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just random.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how 10%, 90% I don't fucking
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people who are there too,
who just heard that if you have fast
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking balling cars, there's people will
think you're fucking cool and you can just
[SPEAKER_01]: be, you know, into that and it's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, and then there's even,
you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's how it is with weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people who are just into
it to try to fucking milk it for what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is and wouldn't have really done any of it
when it was when nobody was looking,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole scene is just, it's a trippy
thing to learn, like to see how shit is
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that and really kind of see it and
then go, okay, well, there's probably a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people who are smarter than me,
who aren't as naive and gullible in
[SPEAKER_01]: general, who just look for a fucking
second and go, oh, this is all douche
[SPEAKER_01]: bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these people are just full of
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there's, that's probably
scares off a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't get to meet somebody like
Bodie or, you know, there's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: people who think Bodie is just like the
rest of everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't know him, if you know Bodie,
you're like, no, Bodie's the cool dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just happens to be in the mix,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even like me compared to Bodie,
I'm probably fucking 20% more douche baggy
[SPEAKER_01]: than Bodie is, or, you know, like,
there's just like a certain, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain thing that I think is probably
really off putting to a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are really into just having the shit they
like to where you'll just never hear from
[SPEAKER_01]: them because they're just fucking cool,
you know, and they don't, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be, they're not going to get the
interest and thinking like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want somebody to grow my stuff because,
you know, like no, nothing ever happens
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put all this time into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like what happened to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, just so fucking excited that
there's people who are into fucking seats,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that I was just like,
whoa, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like all said and done,
you're like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a better feeling for a better feel
for how things are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people who are really like into
plants and they really, really like to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a lot of people who just
want to say, you know, they're the guy who
[SPEAKER_01]: found the RKS and sell a thousand packs
for a fucking bunch of money before they
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking, you know, whatever, just the,
that's just to kind of sum it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's a million versions of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it, but it, but it is, you know,
the guy who's sitting there who really has
[SPEAKER_01]: some shit that really smells like a dead
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's probably like, yeah, but I already
have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the fuck do I want to give it to
anybody for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't need anybody to give me a pat
on the back for having the real skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, like me, I do a lot of things
because I want to like be able to hand
[SPEAKER_01]: something to somebody and have that
interaction of like, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're, we're looking through stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that, you know, but a lot of
people, they don't have any, there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: incentive there for them because they're
just chill and they, they are good on
[SPEAKER_01]: doing whatever they're doing and they got
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I want to make something really
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sit there with somebody and go,
is it really good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we, are we having fun?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is it a good time to, you know,
but that, that's not how everybody is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, uh, I think there's probably a
ton of stuff and then those people just
[SPEAKER_01]: are never going to come out of the
woodwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a, in a sense, it's, it's
unfortunate for the plants themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's no way to really,
that's not really sustainable as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how are, how are those plants going
to survive past the person who that's
[SPEAKER_01]: their end on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, like it's their
prerogative.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need to give them to anybody
for preservation or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, but I, I am of the
belief that there's people who have crazy,
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy stuff and they're holding that
original clone you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the crazy seeds that everybody
wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just like, yeah, what do you
know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I know a lot of people, I have a lot
of friends who are who are really weeded
[SPEAKER_01]: out and who, you know, you talk to them
about something they don't, they don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have no idea of this whole scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know, you know, like I,
at one point I thought there was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe like bog and sub cool and greenhouse
and Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think that's probably at one point
that was, you know, I thought that was,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I didn't know there was all
these people who were on the forums and I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know there was any such thing as a
forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the forums were gone by the time
I even heard of them pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and you know, I think we,
I think we get to see a little slice,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the people who want to come out and
have the interaction for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them, like I said,
some people are like Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want everybody to have cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get a kick out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They spend a lot of time doing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they want to make something of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and then there's people who
will just straight up fucking,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, say they made OG when they
didn't and made fucking whatever when they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're only there to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I don't even think there's
anything wrong with any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not on a scale of, of,
of, like I was saying earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: who are you hurting?
[SPEAKER_01]: The very worst of the weed guys,
you know, maybe they're kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: charlatans, but I mean, you know,
shit, they're not matching up meth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably half of those charlatans
probably were a little while ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Oh God.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit of real wisdom right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed in your answer that you
mentioned Bog, who sadly passed away
[SPEAKER_00]: recently and he's a guy who was really
influential both in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing knowledge, but also his work,
you know, it shows up in a lot of various
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if any of your current lines
you have for sale have his genetics in
[SPEAKER_00]: them, but I do know that you've grown out
a bunch of his work and have posted about
[SPEAKER_00]: it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there any of his strains that
particularly stood out to you as like some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the more favorites from him?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't actually grown out,
um, a lot of his stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had a clone which came to me as
Bubba D.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I realized after a long time,
after knowing his, his sour bubble from
[SPEAKER_01]: him, given me the, the flower when I met
him, cause he, sometimes he'll just,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you see him at a cup, he'll just like
give you a gram of flour or, or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or like, you know, a piece of bubble hash
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one time when I was there,
he, he gave me a bag of flour and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, it was like a gram or two and I
pulled it out and I was like, this is so
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got it home and I realized this is
the same as Bubba D.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I realized when I thought
about it, I went sour bubble, Bubba D,
[SPEAKER_01]: sour D, Bubba, bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty likely that this was a sour
bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody called it Bubba D,
you know, just because of the two,
[SPEAKER_01]: the two words, you know, it's like they go
together and the weed was so similar and I
[SPEAKER_01]: never knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was always like, I don't know how
this could be a sour diesel cross,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially cause I bred it a little bit
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there was no, you know,
sour pops out some trippy weird,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, kind of larpy Fox taily stuff when you
breed with sour, uh, initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that what I had as Bubba D
was really a sour bubble clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that was one that was
around here for a while and people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some people around here are kind
of wrecking that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I got sour strawberry from
them and I think I got, uh, maybe boggle
[SPEAKER_01]: gum and or one of those ones like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one of the bubble gum ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got the sour bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew the sour strawberry and I told
the story on a thing a little while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew the sour strawberry and I didn't
really mean to do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to see what a half pack
looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was going to, if I liked it a lot,
I was going to get a couple of packs to
[SPEAKER_01]: look through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which I didn't, you know, I should
have, but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's a good lesson for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people that if you want some seeds,
get the damn seeds and put them in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fridge because whether you're an older
guy, like, like bog or you're a younger
[SPEAKER_01]: guy, like, uh, you know, it doesn't,
don't just think that these people who
[SPEAKER_01]: make these seeds will always have the same
stock or they'll continue making seeds or
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll always be around for you to get
seeds from.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want something, you should get it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause this has happened, you know,
there's something that happens a lot and
[SPEAKER_01]: people go, ah, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have gotten one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, the seeds, honestly,
the thing with bog was not being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get his seeds is the very least of the
loss that, you know, everybody has to take
[SPEAKER_01]: with, with, uh, him leaving because he's,
uh, he's just a really cool guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, you know, I didn't really know
him and I sat with them and he told me
[SPEAKER_01]: about how he had, he was riding in this
car, I think with, with Shanti Baba,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was somebody like, legendary like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're riding on the Autobahn and this
car with a fucking 700 horsepower,
[SPEAKER_01]: some fucking Jag, fucking V12 or some
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're fucking, we're going
for fucking hundred miles and 120 miles an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, telling these stories and
I'm like, wow, this guy's a character,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was just cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he was telling me these old stories
of being in Europe and different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I wish I, I wish I could
remember the stories more clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what he did leave me with the
impression, he left me with the impression
[SPEAKER_01]: that he was just a really, uh,
um, just a nice guy, really, really a real
[SPEAKER_01]: guy and had done real stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and you know, was, was,
uh, he was a one of a kind guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't, you know, and, and everybody
I've talked to was like, Oh, you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he was the coolest guy you could
talk to with the shows and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would go to the smallest shows and
the biggest shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was, you know, the most
approachable guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a really good, um, he was a really
good role model.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like for, for people in general,
and especially for people like on the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: scene, he was not, uh, he was not a,
um, pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't a douchey dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just like, uh, did what he liked to
do and came to do his thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, I thought he was
really, uh, really kind of a remarkable
[SPEAKER_01]: guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but anyway, I, I got the, uh,
I got the sour strawberry and I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew my half pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have a half pack of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still have the other pack that I
can't put a finger on exactly what it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think it's boggle gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was interested in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he was like, this is straight,
the straight bubble gum in the bubble gum
[SPEAKER_01]: sense, as opposed to the sour bubble,
which he had bred to be more cushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so, um, I grew those sour
strawberries out and I, what happened was
[SPEAKER_01]: I missed a male in a, in a five and a half
inch pot in a flat of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just looked, I had looked through
them, looked through them, looked through
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was probably like one where I was
like, ah, it's unsexed, but it looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: a girl or whatever, you know, classic
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, by the time I saw it was a
male, it had a couple of balls that had
[SPEAKER_01]: popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wound up with these few stray seeds
and one of the thing that was in the flat
[SPEAKER_01]: with that, um, um, there was a plant or
two, um, of this, uh, animal cookies cross
[SPEAKER_01]: animal cookies cross cherry West.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that cherry West was like one of
the ones that I was talking about where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not, um, not crazy and exotic,
no turpentine, no, no fruit punch,
[SPEAKER_01]: no watermelon, no floral.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like, uh, one of the more
normal of the cherry West, like what they
[SPEAKER_01]: usually are, which is more like what I
call black cherry, which was just this
[SPEAKER_01]: deep cherry kind of, um, very flavored
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so it was basically like animal
cookies, but in seed, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, um, super frosty, really,
really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my buddies in the Bay called it the
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a picture like way back on my
feet somewhere of theirs from indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's real pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I found these couple of seats,
um, and, you know, I might still have a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of the original seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure I really should, you know,
hunt through to see, but anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: I took those and I bred them and,
uh, and I have to them and I happened to
[SPEAKER_01]: find just a gorgeous male in the F one and
put that on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two females that were my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them was more green and kind of
garlicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them was more purple and more
kind of cookie gene pool type stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've, those ones I've, uh,
I've gone through them and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: so, you know, kind of turned that into a
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like the sour bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, didn't the sour bubble added that,
that broadleaf gnarly little squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing, um, that they already had,
but it kind of accentuated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't take away from the resin
because it was really resinous too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it added kind of like a jelly thing
that made it so that overall they kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: have this like peanut butter and jelly
cookies thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but in a good way and, uh,
they're just gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made them have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: More like classic, uh, gnarly broadleaf
chunk bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, kind of like, kind of like Hindu look,
but, um, just really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of them get really dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and I was stoked because I have
the, I have other lines that are the same
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of cookie stuff, but the sour
strawberry gave it this other thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: is, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did a lot of those and I'm trying
to, you know, I have F threes of them now
[SPEAKER_01]: and hopefully they're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll probably make them into F fours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably clone some of the best of
the F threes and then, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: try to keep around to F maybe a pair of F
threes to make F fours, um, for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time, you know, to, to just have that be a
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have, you know, like I said,
I still have that, uh, half a pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: those sour strawberries left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can get those to crack,
I'll probably breed that with the sour
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry again, and try to make more
sour strawberries pure to have to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to dig into deeper, knowing now that I
like what came out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, I had a pack of sour bubble
and I had it for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 2019, I grew them and I was,
I kept the mail for a long time and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to seed them and I just kind of
didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they really started budding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I had only got like four
plants out of my pack, um, because I had
[SPEAKER_01]: kept them for a while and I hadn't had
them stored well for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I had left them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I planned to pop them for a whole
year and then I never got around to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally I put them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I screwed them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, I always saw bog at the
different, like he would come to the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer's market here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so like I was used to,
you know, seeing always his booth and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: just grab more, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I didn't grab any of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had that one pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only got so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got, I think I got a boy that I
really liked and I should have kept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I got a few girls and the girls
were just not quite what I wanted,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, as far as the smells that they had,
they were a little too plain, but I should
[SPEAKER_01]: have fucking seated them all because the
reality is that strain is playing anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some good ones that pop out
that have like a special liminess to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that contributed to like the sour dub,
but, um, just not getting what you want
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the few plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should just see them and then you'll
have so many that you can find what you
[SPEAKER_01]: want because all of a sudden you'll have,
you know, whatever fucking hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of F twos, you can look through
and get exactly what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just kind of, I kind of fucked them
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, now, you know, I kicked myself
cause I'm like, man, I would have had a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I had had them in bulk right now,
I could probably, um, I could probably,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, auction them off and,
and shoot the, shoot the proceeds over to
[SPEAKER_01]: Miss Bog and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I don't really have
anything to do that, but I do have the
[SPEAKER_01]: sour strawberry cross and, uh,
you know, I could do something with those
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm waiting to see how everything pans
out right now with their go fund me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it doesn't, if it's, if it goes
slower than it should, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can maybe maybe go on, go on and do
something online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, and then, uh, their niece
hit me up and she, she was kind of just
[SPEAKER_01]: filling me in on where everything stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I guess she had seen my post and,
um, I told her, you know, I go,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, if there's anything you guys need up
there, don't go without it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause everybody, everybody loves them and
they're, you know, we'll get it,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll get it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully they're, um, you know,
hopefully everything works out smoothly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if it, if there's any real
issues, we, you know, everybody will
[SPEAKER_01]: figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one cool thing about a bunch of
weed heads is they kind of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: they kind of all have a good idea that
everything can go wrong when you're not a
[SPEAKER_01]: square and you don't have a pension and
you don't have, you know, the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: come with being a square.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a little more
compassion amongst a bunch of weed heads
[SPEAKER_01]: and growers than there would be among
people who, who don't like understand that
[SPEAKER_02]: world, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's definitely some good
camaraderie within the community when
[SPEAKER_00]: people fall on hard times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, everyone check out the go
fund me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to this shortly after
the release, and by all means,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's any bog genetics you can scoop
up now would be a great time to add some
[SPEAKER_00]: good ones to the library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And funnily enough, I've actually grown
out and worked with some SourStoreberry
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids, a friend did, and they were all
fire too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm totally backing you on this
SourStoreberry cross sound and like a real
[SPEAKER_00]: winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you, we've spoken about a
plethora of different mythical and awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What seeds do you have in your vault that
are some of the most special to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably got more than just one,
but like some of the ones that come to
[SPEAKER_00]: mind when you think of like the really
special ones to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you plan to crack any of them
anytime soon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my craziest stuff is the stuff I was
talking about that I can't get to pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really glad I got them in the fridge
when I did, because I know they're alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they're not rancid and they're not
overheated and dehydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's live cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't have enough to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, the old, I have like big
blue cross big red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are old two Afghanis that I mixed
together because I could never get a good
[SPEAKER_01]: big blue male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't, I didn't know enough at the
time to realize that it's pretty likely
[SPEAKER_01]: that the big blue male, that there's a sex
link trait with the boys that the boys
[SPEAKER_01]: never grow very fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just how they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just thought I had the terrible luck
of always having small boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm like, no, dude, those were all
fine males.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just didn't know that the males of big
blue are small plants, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my theory anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's probably accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I crossed it with big red, the black
aphi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a real special plan of the big red
that was different than the rest that I
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed with the black aphi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those got grown out and were
incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't ever, by the time I tried to
plant them, they just wouldn't quite grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, they would, you put them in
water and after 24 hours, boom,
[SPEAKER_01]: the tail would be popping out and then it
just doesn't grow, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those went in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just need tissue culture,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: They need more than I can do for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have the original, P-O-G-N-L oil
can seeds that were the father side of the
[SPEAKER_01]: black lime that were made with a female
that was the sister of the father of black
[SPEAKER_01]: lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have the original black lime F1
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have a couple of the sisters of
black lime seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Black lime, the original plant that I
crossed with the P-O-G.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're basically the same thing as
black lime except instead of the black
[SPEAKER_01]: lime mother, it's like what I called black
cranberry and then one that looked like a
[SPEAKER_01]: NL.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, you know, those things those older
things that the black aphi cross Hindu,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Hindu cross black aphi, I mean,
and the Hindu cross Hindu cross black
[SPEAKER_01]: aphi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are right there in the top of what I
would get going if I knew I had a reliable
[SPEAKER_01]: person to do tissue culture, to pull out
cells and turn them into callus and turn
[SPEAKER_01]: them into roots and shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, there's the stuff
that's newer that's also really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as neat as those old things are
and as much potential there is and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that, the reason why I have what I have
now is because I made improvements on
[SPEAKER_01]: those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, as far as like Jaro is like you
can still get kind of the Hindu aphi type,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're way, you know, the plants are
five times bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're way more mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can still get the same kind of
weed out of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the reason why some of these
things didn't get planted originally was
[SPEAKER_01]: because they weren't practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had made hybrids with them that were
practical and still had all the same good
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I was saying earlier,
though, you get attached to the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: the originals and the provenance and the
purity and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why those things are real
special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have like some seeds I have
some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: My good, good friend, Moise, passed away
in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his dad was like a kind of a legendary
guy, a really, really good artist,
[SPEAKER_01]: a Frenchman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had got some seeds from me around
maybe 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had his own seeds that he had kept
for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he, you know, he's passed as well as
like the following year.
[SPEAKER_01]: After my buddy, and he was my buddy,
too, you know, and he had a big seed
[SPEAKER_01]: collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his, his wife found it a few years
later in a fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, Hey, I don't know who else would
really want this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there might even be some of your seeds
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she gave me that collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those are still viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I'm afraid to plant
them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took them out and repacked them and made
sure they were real dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually had some moisture in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that it would have ruined
all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I opened up the bags,
there was like literally like water in
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the bags that had probably been
there for two or three years at the least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I repacked them and I tried some of
them and I got a couple of them to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of plants that actually grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they wound up getting messed up
and I didn't get to get them to go all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they would have it was my fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had only tried a couple of ones and
there was a lot of them in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it made me know they were viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one in there called I forgot
there's one in there called BMW Bob Marley
[SPEAKER_01]: and the whalers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one there's a couple in there that
have like just a symbol and I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what it means.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple with initials and I don't
know what they mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one in there that have seeds that
are huge like they're almost as big as
[SPEAKER_01]: peas really you know they're like very big
big big seeds from some kind of an old
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghani I assume he always had really
tasty weed like when he would be rolling
[SPEAKER_01]: up weed we'd always want to check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So old school dude spent a lot of time in
in Goa in India and is just like really
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool dude and kind of you know you
know old school dude grew weed totally
[SPEAKER_01]: secretly and was just an artist and you
know had his little had a couple plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff and you know always had good
smoke and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are really special just because
of the story and who they're from and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that and then thinking of what else I'm
trying to think of if there's anything
[SPEAKER_01]: else that's really really crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you know there's stuff that I have
of course you know cherry limes limes root
[SPEAKER_01]: beers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all cool but those older ones
that I can't get to pop are actually the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that are the most special and you
know I've looked into a couple labs I've
[SPEAKER_01]: talked to a couple people and I'm just
trying to find somebody who won't kill him
[SPEAKER_01]: won't rip me off and you know and has the
right knowledge to do that kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a pretty standard technique but
there's a divide between people who do
[SPEAKER_01]: standard tissue culture for things like
orchids and who really have the right tech
[SPEAKER_01]: and for people who do who do stuff with
weed tissue culture because weed tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culture tends to be like Maristam and
maybe putting seeds into a media into into
[SPEAKER_01]: a media and getting them to sprout helping
them along but I'd really like to find
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who can just slice that seed down
the middle like a mushroom pull out a
[SPEAKER_01]: little chunk grow that callus and turn
that into plants and it's not that people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't do it but like I said there's a
little divide and I you know apologies to
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody if I talked about the shit on the
last one because uh I'm always talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about this shit because it's like the the
holy grail for everybody because people
[SPEAKER_01]: have there's a lot of seeds that won't
come up that still have the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of them so it's like a really
important thing I'm always hoping there's
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who is uh legit who you know
winds up getting into this shit because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty important for sure if anyone
has that knowledge or ability you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: man to hit up let's make it happen I have
to admit I was kind of trying to bait you
[SPEAKER_00]: with that question to talk about the seeds
I've seen on your Instagram page of the
[SPEAKER_00]: big sir it's an interesting one for me
because I find it really hard to get like
[SPEAKER_00]: good information on big sir it's sort of
like this mythical strain anyway what's
[SPEAKER_00]: your experience and if you had to guess
the genetics behind it what do you think's
[SPEAKER_01]: in it well interestingly enough I haven't
actually grown big sir holy weed I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing from big sir called Dolores and I
got it from some friends of mine up here
[SPEAKER_01]: who I trade seeds with and they are just
old-school people who like they grow
[SPEAKER_01]: something and they're like oh this is good
you know and they keep it or maybe they
[SPEAKER_01]: make some more move on to something else
and they've had stuff from you know from
[SPEAKER_01]: way back in the day they're they're old
school they're in their 60s you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: uh really nice people and you know they
told me hey we have this really cool
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexican do you want to grow some Mexican
and I was like well does it finish here
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were like yeah yeah no it's it's
really nice and I was like oh that's
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting I'm always interested in
Mexican stuff that's more fast and and can
[SPEAKER_01]: be grown here because there's a lot of
different climates in Mexico some of us
[SPEAKER_01]: some of Mexico is really mountainous and
you can't grow like crazy sativas you know
[SPEAKER_01]: so the Wahakans always been really popular
here from the 70s and um it was kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the best thing as far as I can tell before
the Afghani and Pakistani came in for this
[SPEAKER_01]: climate and um so they gave me these ones
and I grew them and what was really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting to me and my mom said the same
thing they're kind of the closest thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: the type of northern lights that we had
which I believe was not the one or the two
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was you know like the two cross
the five or something or whatever um I
[SPEAKER_01]: just think that the northern lights we had
had something else in it besides straight
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghani and growing these the way they
look when you grow a lot of them it almost
[SPEAKER_01]: makes me wonder like is this like a
relative of the type of Mexican that might
[SPEAKER_01]: have been in one of the kinds of northern
lights that was used by the seed bank
[SPEAKER_01]: because you know the northern lights was
like there was there was straight Afghani
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there was Afghani cross a
different Afghani and there was Afghani
[SPEAKER_01]: cross Hawaiian and there was Afghani cross
Mexican and I'm like well they're really
[SPEAKER_01]: really like really familiar um the way
they look the way the plant looks the way
[SPEAKER_01]: it grows the color of the weed the color
of the resin the type of resin the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're not particularly smelly in
any real outstanding way they kind of have
[SPEAKER_01]: like they're a little sweet they have
something to them not sweet enough to call
[SPEAKER_01]: fruity sweet keefy hashy you know um but I
was told that the Mexican used in the Big
[SPEAKER_01]: Sur holy weed is Dolores um and mine came
from Big Sur from people who have had it I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess since like the 70s um I mean that's
this that's the story and this isn't from
[SPEAKER_01]: people this is from people who are not in
the whole scene of um trying to show off
[SPEAKER_01]: any provenance or anything like that so
you know their story with me uh holds
[SPEAKER_01]: water because I'm like hey what are there
they're like oh this guy he's our friend
[SPEAKER_01]: you know he's had this Mexican since the
70s he really likes it um I'm like well do
[SPEAKER_01]: you know where it's from and they're like
yeah it's it's it's from Dolores and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like oh okay so you know Dolores Hidalgo
is this place that's in the mountains in
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico um it makes sense that what came
from there would have been something that
[SPEAKER_01]: probably would have finished a little bit
quicker than other stuff after they had
[SPEAKER_01]: selected it for their climate um I don't
know it's been in Big Sur for fucking 45
[SPEAKER_01]: years or whatever um and uh that's the
closest to what I have so this this year I
[SPEAKER_01]: made a whole bunch um there's two basic
types there's one that's more of like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what people would call an indica
where the buds are more easy to trim and
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is a little more squat in there
the buds are a little more round and fat
[SPEAKER_01]: and uh and when I first grew some of them
a couple years ago I went they seem like
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not the same type like maybe
they're pollution from some other line and
[SPEAKER_01]: so this year I did a bunch of them and
then I went ahead and got rid of the males
[SPEAKER_01]: that look like that type but I kept the
girls so that I could kind of get an idea
[SPEAKER_01]: of what they are and now at this point I
don't think they're a different type I
[SPEAKER_01]: think they're just a little bit better of
a of a bud shape and a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: squat of a plant but still the same thing
so if I make them again from the original
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds I'll probably split them into two
lines and do like open pollination with
[SPEAKER_01]: the tall slightly more leafy ones and do
an open pollination with the short more
[SPEAKER_01]: golf bally ones and um this time what I
did was I just did more of the taller ones
[SPEAKER_01]: because they were the ones that I related
more to being like the true what I
[SPEAKER_01]: expected from a from a Mexican type um and
uh they I think are probably the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are a little bit more um a little bit more
what I want and a little more like what
[SPEAKER_01]: our northern lights was the other ones are
a little bit um you know like uh like more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a squat little Christmas tree more you
know they're definitely not like you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: say they're like an Afghani type indica
type thing broadleaf they're not really
[SPEAKER_01]: but they just have a little bit they're a
little bit less um they're a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: less of a narrow leaf type and the the
ones that are the more narrow leaf type
[SPEAKER_01]: are still like more almost like kind of
like a og plant but the squat ones are
[SPEAKER_01]: more like a og shaped bud you know so um
they're really interesting and so you know
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a whole bunch of those and I asked
if I could um if I could share them and
[SPEAKER_01]: they were like yeah we know you know they
thought I was crazy for even you know
[SPEAKER_01]: wondering if I they're like yeah like what
do you mean I was like well can I like
[SPEAKER_01]: make stuff with them and and and you know
do do whatever with them and they're like
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah nobody cares it's like okay cool so I
think what I'm probably going to do I was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to give some of them to CSI so he
could look through them because he has a a
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool big sir holy weed cut um and
then I'll probably just try to spread them
[SPEAKER_01]: around a little bit and then you know
somebody will be able to kind of tell if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's any if there's any relation there
and maybe they're not just because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: you know um from the same place doesn't
mean that they have anything to do except
[SPEAKER_01]: it'd be kind of weird if there was Dolores
in the big sir holy weed and there was
[SPEAKER_01]: Dolores in big sir since the 70s and they
didn't have any relation um that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: really fucking strange so I think there's
a relation there but as far as big sir
[SPEAKER_01]: holy weed I don't I can't even remember
seeing it I think I've seen some of it
[SPEAKER_01]: before I've definitely talked to people a
lot about it because people said it was so
[SPEAKER_01]: good but um I have some from SoCal seeds
and then I think I have some possibly from
[SPEAKER_01]: coastal which are slightly different lines
and then I think Bodie has one a little
[SPEAKER_01]: different than what coastal has but I I
was interested in it but I've never
[SPEAKER_01]: actually done any of them so I can't say
like hands-on what they look like in any
[SPEAKER_01]: similarity or whatever but I will say the
Dolores I smoke and it has a very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting potency where it kind of makes
things seem like lightly absurd like you
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of get a chuckle out of everything
from it and when you like you can like
[SPEAKER_01]: stare at a wall and it's not like directly
visuals but you really look and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like am I is something happening is there
like am I getting a visual and you're like
[SPEAKER_01]: looking you go no it's normal but you
stare and you go I I feel like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: something I feel like I'm almost getting
like a visual here you know it's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: neat it's a cool um it's a cool kind of
high and I don't know if you're a super
[SPEAKER_01]: super heavy daily smoker like I used to
always be I don't know that you would
[SPEAKER_01]: notice that nuance of it but um it's
definitely not just your normal high it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely um there's definitely some you
know narrow leaf stuff going on there it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not a it's not a dull high at all it makes
you feel neat you know there's something
[SPEAKER_01]: to it so those are cool plants and they're
really hardy they don't mold um they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like to get pm unless you're really kind
of making them unhealthy uh they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: the sturdiest because they bud pretty
gnarly but like they're they're they're a
[SPEAKER_01]: really really good plant there's something
that I'll definitely uh I'll definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: try to spread around and I don't know how
many I have now but I think I have
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of them I think I have maybe
like 10 girls fully seated on the late
[SPEAKER_01]: side so they're not like corn on the cob
but they're like all around the outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bud there's a bunch of mature seed you
know so there's there's should be enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to um that after you know a couple years
there should be something that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: uh around you know what a great answer and
um a really interesting high by the sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: of it you mentioned in there wanting to
figure out you know if Dolores was the
[SPEAKER_00]: same or a part of the big sir at least and
it made me think back to a comment you
[SPEAKER_00]: made earlier about fire loss and like how
they allude relationships between strains
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff and I guess what I'm interested
in kind of discussing is obviously people
[SPEAKER_00]: have pretty valid concerns for not
trusting fire loss with genetic samples
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore but I do wonder do we have any
faith in the technology but you know if we
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of put aside personal feelings about
the people running the company and their
[SPEAKER_00]: intentions do you when something on fire
loss shows something else as a relative
[SPEAKER_01]: for example do you put any stock in that
anymore you know I do there's levels to
[SPEAKER_01]: what they can do so if it says something
is related it's very closely related if it
[SPEAKER_01]: says something is not related it might
still be very closely related and if it
[SPEAKER_01]: says something is the same it might just
be related meaning if you give them s1s
[SPEAKER_01]: from a plant they'll think they're all the
same plant but they're not if you give
[SPEAKER_01]: them something that's been bred apart for
a few generations they'll think it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: very closely related to anything even
though it really is so for example I have
[SPEAKER_01]: cherry limeade f3 in there right
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't show that it's related to og or
urkel or you know black lime reserve which
[SPEAKER_01]: is in there northern lights like I know
what's in there right but in their
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis they're like oh yeah it's not
related to anything closely I'm like well
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of urkel and a lot of og in
it I just know that you know and it just
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't show it so in that sense they
can't quite do what they kind of say they
[SPEAKER_01]: can do but at the same time it makes me
realize that if they tell you that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: related it's related you know what I mean
and they've shown relations that are easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to know through other avenues and then you
look at their thing and you go yep they
[SPEAKER_01]: know it there it is you know so you know I
it's a weird thing because it's like okay
[SPEAKER_01]: should you trust them and think that
everything they say is true and no but at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time I'm like I don't really see
what I lost by having my stuff in there I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't really gain much but with certain
samples I think you could you know there
[SPEAKER_01]: is something to gain I think it might be
worth putting in big sir holy weed and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting in Dolores but knowing what I know
it's likely that because big sir holy weed
[SPEAKER_01]: has been bred several times and Dolores
has been bred several times they probably
[SPEAKER_01]: won't show any relation even if they were
related because what they're good at
[SPEAKER_01]: showing is when things are sisters or
parents or progeny as soon as something's
[SPEAKER_01]: not a first cousin or a second cousin it
seems like they kind of can't see it and
[SPEAKER_01]: as soon as something is a full like as
soon as something is an s1 and there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: outside genetics then there's no outside
genetics so it's obviously the same but
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not true you know so they'll tell
you that ghost og Skywalker and every
[SPEAKER_01]: other og cut are all the same cut so when
you grow them you'll think oh well there
[SPEAKER_01]: must have just been some kind of you know
epigenetics or something happened where
[SPEAKER_01]: this got turned on and that got turned off
and then you know it caused this outward
[SPEAKER_01]: appearance of a mutation so that now it
seems like this one's different than this
[SPEAKER_01]: one but look there's the genetic test
they're both the same it's like no they're
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not they're not the same because
people have actually taken a couple s1s
[SPEAKER_01]: that they know they started themselves
from seed and sent them in and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like yep this is all all three of these
are one plant and they're like no I popped
[SPEAKER_01]: those and I know I didn't mix up the
samples and they're like yeah sorry I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess you you you mixed it up like I asked
them on there on one of their like on
[SPEAKER_01]: their Instagram one time I was like hey
like you know do you guys realize that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't tell the difference between plants
from seed that come from one parent with
[SPEAKER_01]: no outside influence and they were like no
we can tell the difference if we say it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the same it's the same and I was like you
can't though and they didn't want to admit
[SPEAKER_01]: that which to me was you know a
fundamental issue in scientific work like
[SPEAKER_01]: you know a scientist has to be able to go
oh there's an anomaly here okay well let's
[SPEAKER_01]: look into that as opposed to going no our
technique is sound it's like you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be able to throw everything away
that you thought right now everything you
[SPEAKER_01]: know if you want to be actual you know if
you want to be a real scientist you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to be able to be handed new
evidence and be able to throw away every
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking thing you knew yesterday and go
hmm we have a new understanding today
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what science is otherwise if you if
you just cling to thinking you're right
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's not what science is science
is based on so you know science science is
[SPEAKER_01]: is data driven you know and evidence
driven it's not based on you know just
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking that if it's if it's if it's like
this it's like this it's like no this
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence says it's not like this but
anyway you know so those are the issues
[SPEAKER_01]: that I see with their thing I see issues
with them ethically because of what they
[SPEAKER_01]: did they basically told the community this
this data is completely worthless and they
[SPEAKER_01]: told their investors this data is
completely priceless and one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things is a lie so either you're lying to
your investors or you're lying to the
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are paying you to do analysis
and you know I think they were not lying
[SPEAKER_01]: to the investors I think that they were
creating a data set that was actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable valuable thing because you know
we don't really know the other stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: they were doing besides that little galaxy
stuff they also could be putting things
[SPEAKER_01]: together and they said it's worthless
because we don't know about the plant so
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't have the plant you don't know
what it is but it's like so you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: already have a description of an OG like
they do have a description of what it is
[SPEAKER_01]: and when they can find these things that
pop up commonly they could find markers
[SPEAKER_01]: and they could do marker assisted breeding
and they could use that data to drive
[SPEAKER_01]: their breeding program which they
basically admitted was what they were
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna do and you know that's that seems
like some bullshit to me but at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time like I said I 'm not completely
against giving them something it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: that when you give them something they
should be saying hey you give us something
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're gonna pay us money and we're
gonna make money off what you give us too
[SPEAKER_01]: and for me I'm like yeah I mean I maybe
I'll give you something but I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to pay you because you guys are already
making money on the back end so fuck that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that's my take on their on their
operation I think a lot of people will
[SPEAKER_00]: rightly feel the same way as you and it's
kind of quite backroom shady practices or
[SPEAKER_00]: the trying to selling of the data they did
I think I heard or read somewhere probably
[SPEAKER_00]: read somewhere that like they tried to
sell the data set to a big ag company and
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the exact reasons you kind of
discussed the big ag were like this data
[SPEAKER_00]: is useless like it's incomplete but it's
just kind of funny that they might have
[SPEAKER_01]: like screwed over themselves in all
regards yeah I I mean I kind of feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's their story is that the data was
incomplete and worthless and that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what they said to cover their ass and once
again like I can't say that that's true or
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's untrue but I kind of feel like
if they had a pretty thorough analysis of
[SPEAKER_01]: all these different things I feel like
there's probably a way that they could
[SPEAKER_01]: have looked at commonalities between
certain things and seen a trend enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: know if they did a little research that oh
these are the strains that are powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew resistant and look they all have
this in common and these are the strains
[SPEAKER_01]: that are high THC and they all have this
in common these are just examples I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know that they would really need yes yeah
but I feel like if they collected that
[SPEAKER_01]: many plants and they say oh well you have
to have the plant to be able to know what
[SPEAKER_01]: these things mean I feel like you don't
really necessarily have to I think all you
[SPEAKER_01]: would really have to do is know the
outward features of the phenotypes of
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants and be able to see trends you
know what I mean to be able to say these
[SPEAKER_01]: are the genes that rule potency these are
the genes that rule high terpene content
[SPEAKER_01]: these are the genes that rule mold
resistance these are the genes that rule
[SPEAKER_01]: that control fast rooting these are the
genes that control the fastest maturing
[SPEAKER_01]: samples like those things aren't that hard
to find those things things out in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion, you know, to know like,
you know, I mean, I don't know how much of
[SPEAKER_01]: that they really got, but it's just,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like they're, even if it was
worthless to them, they could have made it
[SPEAKER_01]: worth something, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a, just a theory, but you know,
I mean, I feel like you could kind of go
[SPEAKER_01]: through and do a little research and go,
oh, what's good about this plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's good about that plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's good about this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: And put that all into your program and go,
oh, these all have this in common and
[SPEAKER_01]: look, hey, they have these markers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the thing they all share in
common.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that must be, it must be this gene or
it must be these, you know, 32 genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These control this when they're all here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is purple weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is mold proof weed or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's what, you know, that's what
other people went through and did.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went, okay, this is the gene that
controls THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they got rid of that and they
went, oh shit, that was also the gene that
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled mold resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you get rid of the THC to make
hemp, then you just destroyed mold
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now all these people who have this,
who, who, who spent this money to in their
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding program, to go, oh, well our hemp
will never have THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we went right around that gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even have that gene present in
this population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they grew it and they found out,
oh shit, that also adds mold resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had all this perfect hemp that all
rotted in the fields because they had
[SPEAKER_01]: completely eliminated it when they just
needed to figure out how to minimize THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: They eliminated THCA and all their crops
rotted, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, however, those guys went about getting
that data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine that Phylos could have
done the same thing with all the samples
[SPEAKER_01]: they had as they analyze them as well,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know, but it just seems
like that would be a practical thing to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with such a huge collection of various
genetics, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many samples they took
in, but it was a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a pretty big galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd definitely be some trends there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called concordance of like
traits or something, but definitely,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely still valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of on that same topic of being a bit
skeptical of sort of bigger ag,
[SPEAKER_00]: big companies in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember about four or five years ago
when REC in Cali rolled through,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was this big fear that like the big
sort of companies were going to come in
[SPEAKER_00]: and just build these huge facilities,
just pump out production, drive the prices
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, everyone was going to lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems as though over the past year or
two, we've seen kind of the opposite in
[SPEAKER_00]: the, I mean, at least in Canada,
for example, some of the biggest producers
[SPEAKER_00]: are just failing and just losing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the industry lost billions of
dollars over the past financial year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that there aren't any notably
big companies in the States who are just
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're all kind of producing lesser
quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that this is like an accurate
sort of portrayal of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think like the bigger companies are
going to generally continue to struggle to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce good quality product?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think that the small time
producers will have a chance to jump back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the game?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I probably shouldn't even really tell
them, but the people who had the big bucks
[SPEAKER_01]: and could afford to bully their way into
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they could have probably done all
right if they would have come in and
[SPEAKER_01]: understood that you need to have minimal
investment in infrastructure and minimal
[SPEAKER_01]: investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: In, you know, in various aspects,
but really focused on, okay, who can we
[SPEAKER_01]: get that can really grow weed that already
grows weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do they do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's invest in them and give them the
ability to grow more weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of rolled with it,
but instead what they kind of tried to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems, it seems like they came in and
they went, okay, we have money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was no shock to anybody,
but we have a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll come in and we will do everything
the way all these dumb asses should have
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing it, but they're all dumb dope
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't know how to do this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to come in here with a real
professional shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to build this $250 million
greenhouse complex and we're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of fucking random people and we're
just going to tell them how to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's just a plant and people grow
plants all the time and we're going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to be bigger and better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I think they just kind of
dropped the ball with that mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like, I mean, I'm not on the
inside, but it's nuts because I see the
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities that they built out and I'm
like, you know, guys, you could have just,
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of building those fucking,
you know, 150 greenhouses, you guys could
[SPEAKER_01]: have just built like four of them and got
a guy who's used to growing like a quarter
[SPEAKER_01]: of that and got him some good help where
he could just point, point fingers and
[SPEAKER_01]: tell them, tell the workers what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they could have, they could have
taken, you know, somebody's existing
[SPEAKER_01]: expertise and scaled it up by giving them
the ability to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that's kind of what the
little guys did because they had a better
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of how shit really works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it gave them the advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say little guys, I don't mean
little little guys, but I mean like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, jungle boys or whoever seems to
be kind of hanging in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems like, it's a really hard
thing to do if you're just going to come
[SPEAKER_01]: in from the outside and just have it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I thought I could tell you
that because I know what it was like to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I did a lot of dumb shit
when I started and you think you can try
[SPEAKER_01]: this and you know, you know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like, huh, okay,
well, that didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least I didn't invest 300 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: million dollars into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you do that, it's like,
well, how are you gonna, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody thought they'll just have
endless money to put into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they, you know, they don't have that
much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everything I think, in general,
the way everything works is everything's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of designed for the bigger people to
do the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they still have the advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they came in and did stuff so
miserably that they still fucked it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the way the way everything's set
up is like, if you're the big if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: the big company, if you're Walmart,
if you're Amazon, if you're Costco,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're whatever the biggest things are,
what's the easiest things in these times
[SPEAKER_01]: to really have be like, sustainable and
keep going, you know, like the bigger the
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at though, the way those
things operate, though, it's like they
[SPEAKER_01]: really figure out, okay, what are what are
we really trying to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of service are we bringing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like they figure it out,
and then they get it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure a lot of people tried and failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was probably a lot of competitors to
Amazon or to Walmart at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, maybe we'll see that maybe
there'll be this one company that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't, you know, fuck everything off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know, at this point,
it's looking like, you know, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: making it really hard for the little guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the little guy still understands what
it's like to do something that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what they're used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the big guys are maybe a little,
a little too comfortable with how they did
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, you know, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'm not in the inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know exactly what goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do I do see what goes right for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's usually, you know, a guy who's
good at doing 20 lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he goes, we're going to do 200 lights,
and I'm going to hire six guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, you know, they're able to
they're able to do it, they keep it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's able to work, you know,
as opposed to somebody who's used to
[SPEAKER_01]: running zero lights, and they decide
they're going to do 2600 lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, they just fucking it's
a it's a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy to have huge disasters
when you're trying to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's not like it's even regular
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this weird, massive horticulture,
in a sense, because it's you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or on a huge scale in these greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know, it's a weird,
it's a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the pressure in those operations
from pests and pathogens and stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's all, you know, it's motto
cropping, and there's a lot of room for a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of room for error.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, hopefully, the little guys
can continue to make it, it just seems
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's it's almost impossible for the
big guys to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they try to make it really,
really hard for the little guys to get
[SPEAKER_01]: their foot in the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like, it's just this kind
of kind of fucked up balance of stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but, you know, I hope I hope I
hope it's the little guys went out and the
[SPEAKER_01]: big guys can't make it, you know,
and that would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll you know, we'll see where it's
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really happy to see like, you know,
you're looking on something and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh, $250 million, greenhouses,
and they're just shutting them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to reopen them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wow, okay, sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, nobody needed that
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a weird, that was a weird play in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what are they going to produce out
of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just going to be a bunch of, you know,
it's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an operation to make really good
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's on such a big scale, it'll never
make really good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the same dudes who did that,
they should have just planted fucking 150
[SPEAKER_01]: acres of hemp and sold CBD all over the
world or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead they spend a million times as
much money and then they, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: frazzle out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a weird, it's silly, you know,
it's a funny thing to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think that the average grower
or consumer is in any better position
[SPEAKER_00]: after the changes brought in with
legalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could make, say, a couple of
small changes to the laws that would
[SPEAKER_00]: ideally improve, you know, the lives of
growers, is there any that immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: jumped to mind that you'd want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that for a long time,
there was the discussion about the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like the one acre per farm
sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any ideas like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my opinion of the whole thing is
that they already know how crazy the
[SPEAKER_01]: economy is fed by cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like if they would have made it so
that you can have weed stores,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you want a store, you have to sell
safe tested product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to sell at a store,
you have to have safe tested product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe make one little regulation
that it's illegal to sell something that
[SPEAKER_01]: has something that's toxic and make a
list, you know, so that there's some kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of recourse if it turns out that somebody,
oh, these people are selling all this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out, oh, it's poisoned or
whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I felt like if they would have just
kind of made it so that it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody can do what they want,
but it is capped.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like maybe if you want to grow
more than a hundred plants, you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a permit or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're going to produce more than
a hundred pounds a year, then you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a permit, but you can go ahead and
just produce that because it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much harmless, you know,
it's pretty low impact if you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: growing a ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you do want to grow a whole
lot of weed, then cool, get a permit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but basically like I,
I think, you know, this is just me
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing it out there and I'm not sitting
down in a, in a room and we're not writing
[SPEAKER_01]: it all down and figuring out what's really
the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think stuff could have been kind of
more just, just more vague like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: being that we already had a functioning
system of people growing weed and smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: weed and selling weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't hearing about people having a
bunch of bad experiences from bad weed or
[SPEAKER_01]: any of this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only stuff I can find that's really
bad about weed is prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get busted or the price gets
artificially inflated, which causes a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of crime because now there's too much
money in the business that wouldn't exist
[SPEAKER_01]: if it was legal because everything would
level out.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people wouldn't be doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people who have no
opportunities who find themselves in weird
[SPEAKER_01]: positions doing shady shit, they could
just fucking sell some weed instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, if you have a neighborhood
where people are all just hanging out,
[SPEAKER_01]: like shit, you can have a couple of people
selling sacks there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you might have somebody selling
this weed, this person selling that weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's a really great tool for an
economy because people want weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for them, does a lot of good
stuff, makes people feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like one is the same as all of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like selling hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where one person's hard drugs the
same as any other hard drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like people want a different
flavor of heroin or a different flavor of
[SPEAKER_01]: crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just are trying to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one person can lock down the whole
trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with weed, it's like, oh, well yeah,
that person might have locked down OG,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this guy doesn't like OG, he wants
sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this guy over here, he's selling
sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an economy, it's really a lot more,
it's like such a neat thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it exists for people, it can be
used for a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it's like, make it legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people do other shit that's already
a crime with it, maybe you'd have to add,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, okay, well, you're selling
unsafe weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no law for that because all weed's
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you make it legal, you go,
well, it has to be safe weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe make that some kind of offense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, like hey,
you robbed somebody for weed, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck, it's already illegal to rob
somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you fucking, you smoked weed and you
drove somebody off the road because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not used to it or you ate some crazy
edibles and passed out or some shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: which probably wouldn't happen,
but that's what people are afraid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sweet, it's already fucking illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no reason for just a drug to
carry a crime for the drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make all the dumb shit people do
that's illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's fucking illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only way you really have to do
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that they did everything with so
much regulation and everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: to me, it's just backwards from the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got a plant, let people grow the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when everybody was making tons of
money, it's funny because they go,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, we want to get our money from the
taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody goes, yeah, that's good,
the tax money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, well, when weed was illegal,
but everybody was making billions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars off of it in California,
because they say it's like a $10 billion
[SPEAKER_01]: business or something in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the state was realistically already
making probably a billion dollars just off
[SPEAKER_01]: of sales tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time there's a tax on all these
other things that are on all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different things, like you got different
taxes that go into, you got hotel taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got gas tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got tobacco tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess where the money comes from
that is getting taxed when you buy all
[SPEAKER_01]: these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming from a lot of weed trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they're like, oh yeah, we're doing
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made a billion dollars in California
off the weed trade this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, but you just, they say 8.7
billion that they didn't tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, well, if it was 10 billion
and you guys already had an 8% sales tax
[SPEAKER_01]: plus all these other random taxes that are
all worked into everything, some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: that are high, like the hotel rooms in San
Francisco is like 22% and shit hotel tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all these things that are producing
all this stuff, the money's all coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you guys are getting your billion
dollars, but you've always been getting
[SPEAKER_01]: the fucking billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the trade is 10 billion, billion
dollars and you guys have been getting 10%
[SPEAKER_01]: of everybody's money, not to mention
everybody who was, who has a business and
[SPEAKER_01]: has it like you got a restaurant,
the people coming into your restaurant,
[SPEAKER_01]: a bunch of them are spending weed money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the owner of that restaurant pays
income tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of these people who grow
weed and have money, they might be,
[SPEAKER_01]: they might have a, they might have another
business and that business is paying
[SPEAKER_01]: income tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all this stuff where there's all
this different shit going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by having a healthy economy,
they're making billions of dollars anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just want to be able to count it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's like, nobody realizes they were
already getting a billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're like, woohoo, we made a
billion dollars off of weed this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, same fucking old
billion dollars, except now there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of people who, you know,
are, you know, not, not, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I got to wonder about the
biggest, the biggest corporations and shit
[SPEAKER_01]: who are, do have these $250 million
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those people might be paying the
taxes on stuff now and on like the weed
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as they were in the game for a
little while and they lobby for shit to
[SPEAKER_01]: change and all this and those little
fucking rules and loopholes and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking fancy fucking attorneys and all
this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those people probably would have been just
like all the other rich people who don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really fucking pay taxes anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why give it to them?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and the rich people don't spend
money at the little businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rich people don't, the money doesn't
really fucking, you know, I was talking to
[SPEAKER_01]: the, talking about this the other night on
this with some buddies on a, on a zoom
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, like the money, the money from
little people who have their little weed
[SPEAKER_01]: or their little business or whatever they
do that are, you know, they, they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: make that much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That money goes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only does it go into the, not only do
they walk into the little liquor store,
[SPEAKER_01]: the little, the little general store,
the grocery store, the clothing store,
[SPEAKER_01]: the restaurant, all this different shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they also pay the money that goes
to the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, okay, it's going up to these
people who have more and the people who,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's also going to Walmart and
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these bigger corporations too,
but you don't see, you're not going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: Bezos or Gates or any of these really rich
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their money doesn't go to the little
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not taking their money and going
and shopping at the little store.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going and buying their clothes
at the little store.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not doing the money from up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never comes back down, but the money
from the bottom goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really want the shit to be healthy
on a small level and it'll feed the big
[SPEAKER_01]: level, you know, but the way the whole
system is set up is to favor those bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: players and their, their shit doesn't go
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just, it's not a, it's not a healthy
model and it's not a real form of
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a weird, it's a weird perverted
capitalism that's more, uh, predatory and
[SPEAKER_01]: like, it's more like, uh, more like barons
and peasants, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, hopefully we see that
hopefully the small guys can, can,
[SPEAKER_01]: can do well and it can shift a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see, you know, maybe it's one thing
where like they have the advantage and it
[SPEAKER_01]: pans out over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it can, but like, that's a,
that's a crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that there's any,
um, there's any point to trying to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, feed these, these, these,
uh, fat cats when they're not really,
[SPEAKER_01]: the money goes with them and it stays with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, uh, if the money comes from
the, from the little guys, the money goes
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes all around and it goes up to the
top too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's in my opinion, just on looking
at things and through history and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: been helpful and, uh, mechanically what
works, you know, the whole trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trickle down shit is total bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and having a small, having a
healthy economy on the, on the small,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, level and the little guys is where
things really go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just by leaving people to do whatever
they wanted with weed, like it was
[SPEAKER_01]: basically in two 15, if they would have
basically just stopped putting people in
[SPEAKER_01]: jail, um, and tell people you can't sell
poisonous weed pretty much would have
[SPEAKER_01]: solved the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe one day we'll get to that point,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that, if, if we got to that point,
that's when I would say, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, um, if you want to have a big
business, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you need to be regulated cause
you're big, but if you just got a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of weed, you should just be able to do
whatever the fuck you want with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what an insightful sort of,
uh, take on the whole situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we kind of look at, uh, one of the
people who the public sometimes forget are
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact, uh, one of the smaller guys we
reference jungle boys, they're certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: doing things right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, getting a little bigger,
but still smaller guys compared to the big
[SPEAKER_00]: ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to bring them up because recently
an interview came out with them where they
[SPEAKER_00]: said they don't cure their flower before
sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Ivan was pressed a little bit
about why that is, he says, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's because, um, the turps are
like at their most highest concentration
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're kind of most popping at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is, do you think that all
weeds should be cured?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you kind of understand this
underlying idea that he's presenting that
[SPEAKER_00]: like the most freshest the cannabis is
ever going to be is before a cure?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen some weed and I know
like, with like, um, some crazy narrow
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf stuff, like that would never be
anything they'd be growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's not practical and it's not so
much what people want, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think some of those things are
better after they sit and cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think for people who just want
really loud, stinky weed with the most
[SPEAKER_01]: turps and the brightest color and kind of
what people want in the market,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people do want fresh weed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am of the opinion that when your
weed is, when your weed is dry,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I don't put weed away when it's a
little wet and burp it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like to me, that always winds up
fermenting the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've done it side by side,
lots of different ways on accident,
[SPEAKER_01]: on purpose, jars, bags, tubs, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, you dry the weed so that it
takes a while to get dry and you keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it gets done to me, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I, I, uh, I believe that
the drying process is the cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, that takes between two and
three weeks, ideally about three weeks to
[SPEAKER_01]: really be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point it should be all the way
dry and you put it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think it ever gets any better
unless maybe it's like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: odd, odd type, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as if you're growing like OG
and cookies, derivatives and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: things, I think, you know, that it,
that it should be, it should be hanging up
[SPEAKER_01]: until it is dry throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that at that point you should be able
to put it away and it should be sticky and
[SPEAKER_01]: dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the stems should be snappy and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The weed should be sticky and it should be
dry weed, as dry as you want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you seal it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's done, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how, um, that's how it comes
out best for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way that it smells like what
it's supposed to smell like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tastes like what it's supposed to
taste like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that is its identity captured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you want it OG?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, smell this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, damn, that's fucking
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you put it away when it's a little
moist and you burp it and shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll just, you're just going to make it
smell like dough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just going to get,
um, fermented and there's going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, funk and it's not, you're going
to lose, it's, it's going to lose its
[SPEAKER_01]: sharpness, you know, in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I asked that question
actually is because I noticed while
[SPEAKER_00]: reading the Sky Cut Lakush description,
you mentioned that it has a long shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of got me thinking about the
two polar ends of the spectrum where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you've got Ivan saying it's best
at the start, but then you're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing this idea that these genetics
are designed to kind of retain the turps
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going to have a longer shelf life
and a stability in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's kind of an accurate
take on the situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as like a bit of a follow-up,
do you think that it might benefit shops
[SPEAKER_00]: or sellers to think about this and try to
stock like one of each so they've got like
[SPEAKER_00]: both the short and long-term covered?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, there's certain things like,
you know, I say like the Sky Cut Lakush
[SPEAKER_01]: has Sky Cut Lakush, Jaro, Root Beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have good shelf life because of the
type of resin that they have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The resin stays in the resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it is on the weed, but it's where it
is and it stays there and it's solid and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like Cherry Limeade,
when it sits, the resin is so oily and the
[SPEAKER_01]: resin heads have such a thin membrane that
it actually, the weed itself will soak up
[SPEAKER_01]: the resin because it's wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not wet, but the oil is so thin and
runny in a sense, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That it wants to soak into the weed and so
it turns the weed dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like there's anything wrong with
it, but it's like you look at Cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: Limeade fresh, and it's not every plant,
but most of them, you look at it fresh and
[SPEAKER_01]: it looks incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have it for three or four
weeks and you're like, oh, it looks really
[SPEAKER_01]: dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it almost looks like what other weed
looks like if you were to go to fuck up
[SPEAKER_01]: and go, oops, I spilled some oil on it or,
you know, somebody was being a goofball
[SPEAKER_01]: and dipped it in fucking, you know,
like the first step of moon rocks or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, it's greasy and dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're really, if you really know
what's up with it, then you just look at
[SPEAKER_01]: it and you go, ooh, damn crazy,
you know, like that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can appreciate it, but people want
a certain type of product presented to
[SPEAKER_01]: them when they buy a jar or a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't really fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a smoker, if I give you some year
old Cherry Limeade and it's all greased
[SPEAKER_01]: out, you're like, ooh, damn, okay,
this is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you roll it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, shit, how's that so
tasty?
[SPEAKER_01]: So technically it has a great shelf life
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Sky Cuddler Kush, you'll look at
it when it's fresh and you'll look at it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a month and it'll be the exact same
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not that it gets better a month
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that it doesn't get worse
looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I say it has good shelf
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like it's improving, but it's not
going down the tubes visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the Cherry Limeade isn't going down
the tubes as far as what you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to smoke it and it's going to
be dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people are going to look at it and be
like, eh, it's dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not shiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does it look like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to be educated to know that,
oh, that's because it's approaching five
[SPEAKER_01]: and 6% terpenes on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the type of terpenes it has are the
type that want to basically soak into
[SPEAKER_01]: anything it's next to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it breaks its self down with this
very fine oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually is a sign of its quality
that it looks so terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's no way to explain that to
somebody who just grabbed a jar and looks
[SPEAKER_01]: inside and goes, well, these guys sell me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want this anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely a thing to shelf
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's even discussed in marijuana
botany back in the 80s, like some weed
[SPEAKER_01]: lasts and looks pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some weed drops its resin easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you handle it, a lot of the resin
winds up at the bottom of the bag and it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't look as pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some holds onto its resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's different qualities to the way
resin is on a plant that make it good for
[SPEAKER_01]: some things and not as good for others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Cherry Limeade, the shelf life on it
flavor wise is amazing, but the color gets
[SPEAKER_01]: dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you wanted to sell pre-rolls,
you sell pre-rolls of Cherry Limeade.
[SPEAKER_01]: People get a pre-roll and it goes through
the whole system and they get away later
[SPEAKER_01]: and they smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, damn, this is still really
bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas some of the stuff that might look
pretty at that point, it doesn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: it hasn't maintained its funk like
something with so much terpenes would,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Cherry Limeade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to kind of know what product
you're trying to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to make, you know,
you want to make tomato sauce,
[SPEAKER_01]: you use a sauce tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you want to, you want to ship
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use the one that's going to ship the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to use, do you want to make like
ketchup?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a sweeter tomato or whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you don't want to use a,
you don't want to use a Carolina Reaper to
[SPEAKER_01]: make pico de gallo to fucking sell to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're going to have to tell people
what that is and people have to know what
[SPEAKER_01]: that is, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like everything's got its place,
but what people want right now in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: cases is what pleases the most people and
needs the least explanation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look in there, you go, Whoa,
that's some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why there's such a popularity
with cookie derivatives and things that
[SPEAKER_01]: are, you know, have OG in them or
whatever, because you just take a look and
[SPEAKER_01]: you go, huh, this seems like it's pretty
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not, you know, this isn't the weed
at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is something that,
and that's why they call it exotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it looks like something crazy and
people, people laugh at that because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like, well, it's common.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not exotic, but it's still,
you know, it's still the look of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, of what people kind of has that knee
jerk reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a crowd pleaser, all those kinds
of looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, people buy something,
they want a lot of resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's nice if it has, if it has a look
to it where you go, Ooh, that's pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just plain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, purple weed, the first time
someone sees purple weed, I guarantee
[SPEAKER_01]: every time they go, Whoa, what's up with
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that real?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah, it grows like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it, do they dye it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it watered with dye?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, you know, it's, it's not real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, then people have seen
purple weed for awhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, Oh, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but it's, it's, uh, you know,
the market is, is selling to people who
[SPEAKER_01]: are, um, impressed at certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think like, uh, you know,
shelf life is good in certain ways for
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things, you know, and then there's
other types of shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, but like, you know, something
like I was talking about was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at it in a jar and it's a few
months old and you're like, boom,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, fresh weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sits and it lasts, you know,
um, but you know, it doesn't have to sit
[SPEAKER_01]: to get good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't have to be totally fresh to
be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's what's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, any, any, any kind of agricultural
thing, you really want the shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you want an apple, you can ship,
you want a tomato, you can ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to go bad in two days,
but in, you know, like with like heirloom
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes, the best ones, they get really
juicy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you stack them up, they'll squash
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, you know, the best strawberries
have too much sugar though.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll rock really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to pick them and eat them right
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like something like cherry lime
made it's killer, but it's not really fit
[SPEAKER_01]: for being packed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, so there's that,
there's that thing there where a fruit or
[SPEAKER_01]: a vegetable has to be able to ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be able to sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be able to look good to the most
people, even if the people who know the
[SPEAKER_01]: most might think it doesn't look the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, that's with Martin,
with marketing things, that's what people
[SPEAKER_01]: are trying to hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going, you know, they want to,
they want to have the most sales to the
[SPEAKER_01]: most people, the most often, and they want
to have the most return customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, you try different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certain things work and it might not,
you know, they might not be the best to
[SPEAKER_01]: certain people, but if they average out at
being the best to the most people,
[SPEAKER_01]: then there's your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what a hit record is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what a hit pair of shoes is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what, you know, whatever,
whatever it is, those are the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: catch on and get, uh, you know,
get some steam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly a lot more complexities
than what might seem apparent on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, isn't there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of, uh, loud turps, I've been
wanting to follow up with you about one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the favourite things I tried from you,
the male Emsky project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you figured out what is your
favourite pairing with this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the listeners who aren't aware,
this is a cut that Gene has that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: tangy on steroids and also roid raging and
also even then way better and different to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually a seed line, which is
cool because it's totally, every,
[SPEAKER_01]: every plant has the same, has the same
turps and there's a slight variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are a little better smelling than
others, but, um, my buddy Jim had it and
[SPEAKER_01]: he had been calling it lemon Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I told him, Hey, there's already a
lemon Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, well, I used to call it green
Lantern, but then I heard these gangster
[SPEAKER_01]: rappers rapping about green Lantern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so then I changed it from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I changed it to lemon Kush and I
go, well, there's a lemon Kush too,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I, I go, you know, it's not so
much that you don't want to use the same
[SPEAKER_01]: name, but I go, there's people who think
of it as like being like a, a train wrecky
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a thing, you know, that people,
uh, when they hear lemon, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's like a different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I don't know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he didn't really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I was like, I was like,
shit, it smells like Meyer lemons,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like it's like lemon,
but it's really sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it actually, when it finished,
it developed this passion fruit,
[SPEAKER_01]: grapefruit thing, you know, but I was
like, Oh, I'm going to call it Meyer lems,
[SPEAKER_01]: Meyer lemski, like Meyer Lansky and Meyer
lemons, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and, uh, you know, so I called it
that for when I, when I worked it for
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, I haven't done anything with it,
but I told him, Oh, Hey, I gave it this
[SPEAKER_01]: handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and he didn't really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just, it's his old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it is, is it's old.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had this old Santa Marta gold from,
from the seventies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then somebody passed it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was this killer, uh, it was this
killer weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, man, that's the tastiest
joint ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, what's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all, it's called Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's all, Hmm, Indica, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was like 83 or 82, or I don't
know, sometime back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, uh, it was like, you know,
an Afghani or Pakistani, and it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: like that really good, nice, um,
you know, those best ones that are like
[SPEAKER_01]: Hindu, you know, the really tasty,
deep, rich flavor, like what I call big
[SPEAKER_01]: blue or kind of like what the black Afi
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, from his description
and he, and he was like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy was like, the guy was like,
Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had like two or three seats from
rolling the joint and he gave them to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he planted them and he crossed
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he said, like late eighties,
he got the stuff that they called the red
[SPEAKER_01]: vein, which I think based on the
neighborhood he was out of, that it
[SPEAKER_01]: probably is, is related to what we call
the perp, which is in the black lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pinia and, um, has the reddish
purple stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, but I'm not positive of that,
but it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he said he crossed those together
and then he just started breeding them
[SPEAKER_01]: every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't have the red, the red veins
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they don't have the Colombian stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're these squat little Indica plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't produce quite as much resin as
you want them to have, but the terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it smells like Meyer lemon,
grapefruit, passion fruit, which is like
[SPEAKER_01]: my very favorite tangy throws that are
really rare and pop out like in the sour
[SPEAKER_01]: tangy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but instead of it being like this rare
thing and being mixed in with like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like kind of like train wreck
terps and stuff, like how tangy seat is,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every once in a while,
one's a little toned down or one has like
[SPEAKER_01]: a hint of some other kind of like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet banana or whatever kind of thing in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but pretty much they all do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you cross it with anything,
everything turns into that turp,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it bullied the hell out of GMO and
turned it into purple Meyer lemski with
[SPEAKER_01]: tons of resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one's promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then there's some other ones too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And skunk tech was the one that made the
outcrosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I crossed it with lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't grown them yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made a ton of the pure seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as soon as I planted them,
I looked at the seedlings and I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are killer right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time I found out the backstory
on them, um, I already had plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: were like butted out and I was smelling
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what the hell are these?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I, I got them from, from Jim's
daughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, and a little trade with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I saw him and I go, what is the
story dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was when he told me what they
were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so it's just a really neat,
um, pure line from the eighties of all old
[SPEAKER_01]: seventies and eighties stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's one of those things where if
it was put out pure, people would be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: nah, this is, I don't want this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't have enough resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, uh, if you make oil off of it is
insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tastes really good too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't look, it's like how
Skittles looks like it's not that good,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then it's tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that, except the oil is like
tasty as tasty or tastier than Skittles,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the weed is like worse looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little greener.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little more bright, but it just,
it doesn't look like there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: resin on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's cool is you take that and you
cross it with anything that's super
[SPEAKER_01]: resinous and it just comes across in every
plant on the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eventually I'll probably do,
um, something with it, but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point we haven't done anything
with any of the crosses cause we didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to step on toes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I had talked to him about,
you know, if I ever do anything like,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it cool?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, what will, we can do some
kind of split on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's your old genetics and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was totally down, but, um,
I just haven't ever put any more focus
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have thousands of the, of the pure seeds
I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I did like six different plants
and they were all killer, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like the best three put aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I'm sure when the time's right,
you'll, uh, you'll do something special
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was looking at some of your other
strains, it made me realize that many of
[SPEAKER_00]: your lines, we see a lot of resistance to
mold and to rot and to drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's obviously because for
the longest time you're growing outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: and those are obviously like really
important factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But kind of, if we think about the
producers, we were talking about a few
[SPEAKER_00]: questions back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that some of these traits
might ever start to become more seen or
[SPEAKER_00]: try to be expressed by these companies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are so many companies moving
into greenhouse cultivation and like many
[SPEAKER_00]: of these problems like mold rot,
um, are just some of the biggest issues
[SPEAKER_00]: these larger producers face?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there's a, I think there's
quite a bit of focus on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already, um, depending on who the,
who the people are, um, people who have
[SPEAKER_01]: dealt with those issues or the people who
are more likely to kind of steer in those
[SPEAKER_01]: directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, I think right now it,
I think there's a lot of stuff going on
[SPEAKER_01]: that hasn't really been seen yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think right now there's probably already
people in labs finding all the markers for
[SPEAKER_01]: all these desirable things and making it
so that you could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically send them samples of your plants
and they'd say, Hey, here's your mail that
[SPEAKER_01]: won't, that will breed for no mold for no
mildew for this pest resistance for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's already being done and it's
just not really quite, um, it hasn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the wave hasn't quite hit,
but I think it's already sitting out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's already, uh, I think it's
already a thing for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it just, there's people who have
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Done it out of necessity and, um,
and I'm not the only one, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, bio vortex green source gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're called, uh, uh,
homegrown natural wonders, Odie and mush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, there's they're,
they're out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people, there's people doing it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I, but, but I think that also
there's people involved in big ag who are,
[SPEAKER_01]: who are doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Behind the scenes and that will be,
that'll be the new, I think in a year or
[SPEAKER_01]: two, that'll be the big marketing push.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, buy our pounds of hemp seed because
it's, you know, it will get zero mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they'll, they'll figure out,
um, things that offer resistance and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and see what really, really does that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earlier on in the episode, we spoke
about the Emerald Cup and the ego clash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of sort of mixed
thoughts about some of the bigger events
[SPEAKER_00]: recently, particularly as they sort of
rebrand themselves, especially the Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup is sort of a more casual smoker event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as catering as much to the
hardcore growers, especially not the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders and the sellers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see yourself continuing to go to
these events or do you think the smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: ones like the ego clash are going to bloom
more and become the mainstay of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I kind of like the,
I like the aspect of, of the, of the big
[SPEAKER_01]: shows just because they, they put the most
people in one place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's like a super cool,
uh, it's a cool opportunity to meet the
[SPEAKER_01]: people who you might not meet at the
smaller ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think probably the most, really the,
the, the most, uh, kind of renowned
[SPEAKER_01]: official real head event is the ego clash
that B puts on, um, because he's the most
[SPEAKER_01]: like connoisseur minded.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, you know, kind of has, uh,
he, he, he has a really good, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: feel for Terps and quality and,
um, and has that focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of the, one of the best at that
and recognizes that in other people and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and reaches out to the right people
to where if you win that to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the one that's like, damn,
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you, you really had some shit because
it's blind and it's the same people who
[SPEAKER_01]: enter, who are judging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of, uh, more of an
invitation only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I think, you know, that that,
that's the more like the serious one,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's, you know, an event isn't only
about the contest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how official it is an event is also
about a social space and, um, a gathering
[SPEAKER_01]: of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, when it's opened up to
so many people from everywhere and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just whoever, you know, there,
there's an aspect there that's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so, you know, I support both both
sides and I think they both have their
[SPEAKER_01]: own, uh, they both have their own thing
going to them, you know, going for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I think they both deserve
their, their respect in their,
[SPEAKER_01]: in their own space and that, um,
what the Emerald cup was for a while is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of now what the ego clashes where
it's like, okay, that's the most,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, probably respectable award you can
get.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that the Emerald cup is still,
is still a respectable award as well at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point to get, you know, and that
they're kind of the, the two, the two main
[SPEAKER_01]: things, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very diplomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a few more questions as we're on
the tail end of things before the fast
[SPEAKER_00]: five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I asked you this in our first
interview, so I'd love to see how things
[SPEAKER_00]: have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any breeders work that's caught
your eye and you're kind of enjoying the
[SPEAKER_00]: work they're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, like I was saying, I like souvenir
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Pip, he does great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even have to get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can look them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how, man, I, this is the one where
it's always like, I know guaranteed
[SPEAKER_01]: there's going to be, uh, there's going to
be a lot of people that I don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I don't name him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say is cool just because he's bringing
out old stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, everybody wants
something real sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: His stuff is real.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got the real cool sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, everybody else, I mean, I think I've
probably mostly given shouts to everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: who's, who I can really think of,
um, doing a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my buddy Dutch at regenerative is
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been going through some stuff with
crazy pressure, uh, like the bad weather
[SPEAKER_01]: in Washington and pulling stuff out of,
out of my gene pools I've worked with and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, you know, finding what is really,
really can take the bad elements and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he, uh, um, trying to think of
anything that just like pops out as being
[SPEAKER_01]: new, like it was kind of somebody I didn't
know a year or two ago, I think about
[SPEAKER_01]: their work and they didn't, I don't think
he had dropped stuff really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I don't know, you know,
just everybody who's, everybody who's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing stuff that they're, that they're
interested in and going with their flavors
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that, you know, um, yeah,
I don't, you know, I don't, besides what
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already, who I always say,
you know, always, uh, I always like to
[SPEAKER_01]: watch like, you know, what CSI is doing
and 707 seed bank, but there's tons of
[SPEAKER_01]: them and there's tons of people doing
really cool stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, uh, you know, uh, Jay trees and
skunk tech have been doing really neat
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some solid answers there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, I definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been following both of those guys
doing some, some really good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so the next question I had for you was
what's the most unique turf profile you've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever come across and do you still see it
around or is it gone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most unique turf profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, straight opium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is similar to like a Sharpie or a
flea collar, or, um, there's a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: smell that, that straight opium has.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one thing I saw in the nineties
that I really wish I could find again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's a certain smell and taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that would be the most rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really a standout because
everything else is like, there's like
[SPEAKER_01]: things close to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's completely unique and I've never
seen any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything like it since.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say I'm familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you're able to find that one
and it is still around kind of on a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: a different topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to ask you, we heard some word
recently from none other than Chimera that
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom Hill had passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it turned out that that was like
a bit of a fake report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you hear from Tom himself or through
the grapevine sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you know what he's up to or if
we'll ever see his seeds come back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't think he's too into it really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think he does stuff for himself and
he's kind of good with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he's a really cool dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know him personally, but I went to
school with his brother and sister.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'm online and I see like
top dog posts about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and it's like, it looks like it's
official.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go, okay, well I'm going to go look
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look and everybody's like,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are like, yeah, it's,
you know, from people who are close to
[SPEAKER_01]: them, it's true and blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So normally if something like that
happened and I had just got like a little
[SPEAKER_01]: word of it, I would, I would hit somebody
up if, if it's like their family and I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: be like, Hey, you know, is, is that,
is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but I've had that experience
before and it always feels kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of even bothering with that,
I just was like, well, it seems like it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was real at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hit up my buddy and I go,
Hey, you know, um, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry to hear about, about your
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's anything I can do, just,
you know, reach out like, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: love you, dude, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he hits me back and he goes,
what my brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, dude, I hope it's, if you haven't
heard, I go, I hope it's fake.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I just, it seemed like it
was real.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize if it's, you know,
if it's, if it's, if it's fake,
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he goes, hang on, let me check.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, huh, it seems like there's
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, he didn't fucking know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I was able to get ahold of him
right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would I be the first person to get
ahold of him?
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, shit, hopefully it's fake,
but I'm still sweating it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and, uh, and so, uh, you know,
cause I'm fucking bummed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm like, huh, dude, are you serious?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he goes up, just heard from him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, dude, I feel like such a piece
of shit right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: For like, I just basically told you your
brother died, you know, like, and it
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is the worst fucking bullshit I
can really remember right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't remember doing some shit
that's dumb for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like this is, this was bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I tell him like,
Hey, sorry, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, and then I explained like this dude,
Chimera, he's a big seed dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, he told people on the forums and said
it was totally for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had heard direct from, from,
from people who knew and this and that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, I'm like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, that was how that played out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I ran into him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran into my friend, you know,
like, uh, down on the street in UK,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even want to mention it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just was like, Hey, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I was still like
embarrassed really, you know, cause I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like, dude, what a, what a bullshit thing
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was, but, but, but at the time,
of course my intention was just to like
[SPEAKER_01]: reach out and be like, Hey, you know,
like it, you know, just offer help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shit, but so I was like, my heart was
in the right place, but my brain was
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking, you know, in the wrong place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just some, some bullshit that
was in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was frustrating that people had put
it out in such volume that it was fake,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that it was real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was fake.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, it was like,
well, you know, it's the last time I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: ever going to do that without just being
like, Hey, you know, if I heard,
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard something about so and so,
like, is there, is there any truth to
[SPEAKER_01]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, so, uh, that was,
that was my experience with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, man, fucking jokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it, you know, cause it, uh,
was, um, you know, like I can think,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, it was embarrassing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality was like, my real thing
was I just felt like shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was like, damn, like how'd I make
him feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that was, that was what,
that's how that went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a dumb ass gene on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, too harsh on yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I'm sure he probably wasn't too put off
by it, but there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good answer to the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a new question I've been loving to ask
all the guests recently before we wrap
[SPEAKER_00]: things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any other passions in life
besides breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: We see on Instagram, like a lot of
breeders like to breed dogs, some dabble
[SPEAKER_00]: in cars, some dabble in various other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there some other aspect of mean gene,
which the public isn't aware you're
[SPEAKER_00]: invested in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I haven't been doing it that much,
but I like to, I like to DJ, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: to mix, um, make mashups, like play one
thing over another, like in real time,
[SPEAKER_01]: like on turntables or like CDJ turntables,
you know, like, uh, you know, drop
[SPEAKER_01]: something out of this and, and play this
over the top of that and make,
[SPEAKER_01]: make mashups and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I've been doing that since like
2006 or 2007, like often, but then I
[SPEAKER_01]: stopped for, I haven't really done it for
years and years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I really like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like to just listen to music,
um, do some music I've done over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years, done some, done some vocal shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, I like, uh, I like to look
for mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to look for arrowheads and,
uh, I really, as funny as it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like fucking movies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I just like to watch great movies or
shows or things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just, uh, you know, um,
I really like comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like crazy, epic stories, just,
just neat, interesting stories about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, human shit, like outlaw Josie
Wales or last of the Mohicans or gangs in
[SPEAKER_01]: New York or like kind of like big,
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ones like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, but beyond, you know,
beyond just being like, Oh, I'm just going
[SPEAKER_01]: to stare at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why I like really, I really liked that
kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it was easier to be involved in
like making movies and shit, I'd probably
[SPEAKER_01]: be wanting to be, you know, want to do
some of that, but it's not something I
[SPEAKER_01]: have that much ambition in, but I really
do love, uh, I love that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, you know, I mean,
I like food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not, there's not really anything
that I'm as into as, um, as I am into
[SPEAKER_01]: weed, you know, but, um, but I like,
you know, I'm into, I'm into stuff that,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, involves checking out aesthetics of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but as far as doing stuff,
making stuff, made some music over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years, like I said, I like the mixing,
making remixes, smash ups.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably my main things really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to observe things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to absorb information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, so I like to read stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to check stuff out like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, love to go to the river in the
summertime, go swimming, go to the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I really enjoy that, uh, part of
nature, probably more than the average
[SPEAKER_01]: person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like really soaked that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like my happy place, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, family for me is big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, I really like chilling with my
son and my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of sums up my life,
you know, not super.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to travel a little bit,
but it's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have friends who that's really what
they're into is traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to do it sometimes, but it usually
takes it out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I get, I usually wind up getting
like burnout and sick or something from
[SPEAKER_01]: either partying too hard or just the
travel and the stress of the actual travel
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, but I like that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, I'm pretty,
uh, I'm pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have anything that's like a
big, a big thing that I like to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, spend money on or, um,
you know, I just, just kind of chill
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty, pretty, um, yeah, pretty simple,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: A man of simple pleasures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this brings us to our final five
quickfire questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty confident they're different to the
ones you did last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to hear the answers to this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, first one is what is the absolute most
memorable cannabis experience you've ever
[SPEAKER_00]: had?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be it smoking a flower, hash, being
somewhere, doing something, which one
[SPEAKER_00]: stands out the most to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was definitely some,
some memories that were, that were really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting, like getting, getting way too
high and being like almost blacked out
[SPEAKER_01]: when I was young, where, you know,
they just have that impact of being like,
[SPEAKER_01]: holy shit, I think I'm going to be high
for the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm just, you know, you're just
clouded in a daze and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: those kinds of, those kinds of stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, um, you know, I don't know,
like, just everything, it's so much weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't, it's not anything that
stands out, but one really crazy one was,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, one time I took a bomb hit dude and I
stood up to go spit in the, in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bathroom sink as bomb heads
sometimes have to spit after their coffin
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to stand up and I got a little
lightheaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sat back down on this big bean bag
and then I stood back up cause I was good
[SPEAKER_01]: and I went and I spit in the bathroom and
I went, came back and I started getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit like kind of, kind of my vision
started getting white, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went to like kind of belly flop
onto the bean bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as I was going to belly flop onto the
bean bag, I like lost consciousness and my
[SPEAKER_01]: body moved a little bit and I fell to the
side of the bean bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I woke up, my, my jaw was so
dislocated that like my, my one,
[SPEAKER_01]: my right side of my teeth was underneath
the left side of my top teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the bottom, bottom right was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Underneath the top left, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my jaw was completely dislocated to
the point where I was like, damn,
[SPEAKER_01]: am I gonna die or, or like in that,
like still, that's why I said like good
[SPEAKER_01]: things or bad things that still stands out
as the craziest fucking weed experience I
[SPEAKER_01]: ever had because I thought I had like
ruined my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like to look, I wish if, if, if they,
back then, if it would have been like we
[SPEAKER_01]: had camera phones around all the time and
I had a picture of it, you would be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: holy fucking shit because my, my,
my, my whole face was just fucking twisted
[SPEAKER_01]: around the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nuts, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, that has to be like the
craziest weed experience ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just a fucking bomb hit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was like, dude, it was insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: All my, all my teeth were bleeding between
the teeth, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I had hit so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this big berry on my chin and I was
like, man, I, I had to straighten it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had to like open my mouth real
wide and push on the sides and it like
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking popped back in and it,
you know, it, it, it never was a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent, you know, it's still a little
tiny bit off this, you know, 20 years
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was nuts, but that's a crazy story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got a new benchmark with
that one on the other end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to think least memorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there ever a time when all of the
people, you know, hanging out with were
[SPEAKER_00]: just like super hyped on this certain
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you finally got around to
trying it, you were like, Oh, is that it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, usually things haven't
been super hyped or if they are so hyped,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I kind of assume they're going to
suck anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I see them, I'm like,
it was actually pretty good, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not something that I've
experienced a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's good considering
you've been living in the heart of the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed Mecca since the start, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question would be if you're
about to be dropped off at a desert Island
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can only take three strains with
you that you've got to smoke for the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of your life, which three would you take
with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd definitely take lime one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably take root beer or anything
that's kind of in there in that mix of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Jaro stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a third one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just because it would be a good,
a good other side of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know what it's like to have not had
it, which I, and I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really enjoyable for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that sweat, but I don't know if I
would put it as in the, in the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the top three as a third one would be
like, then it gets hard, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I really know why I'm one's my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really know root beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to smoke anytime when I'm like,
I've already smoked a bunch of lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, it's like a big wheel
of a bunch of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would be, I wouldn't be super,
super concerned as long as I knew I had,
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as I knew I had the lime and then
something else, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a nice little selection
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we flip the tables now and you're
going to be dropping off someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not particularly fond of to that
same Island and you get to choose what
[SPEAKER_00]: three strains they get, which three are
you going to give them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some kind of cardboardy, peanut Shelly,
Ruderales.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just remember like some
Ruderales stuff that had that kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, where it's just like,
there's nothing really redeeming about the
[SPEAKER_01]: smell and then you smoke it and you don't
really get a high you would want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that was like, you know,
like the, basically what I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people would recognize as the auto flowers
that you don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people have probably seen
that style.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see it in pictures all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, Oh, I got this auto
flower such and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, that's that,
that's that very undesirable Ruderales
[SPEAKER_01]: look with the really dark red hairs that
has like the, this dark greenness to it
[SPEAKER_01]: and just not, there's something,
there's this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I know that type and I can
see it as soon as I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's just that plane kind of just
this, the high that just doesn't really do
[SPEAKER_01]: much for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that would be, that's like my,
kind of my least favorite thing that I can
[SPEAKER_01]: think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen it come out, you know,
of different stuff, like even out of kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of cool Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'll pop out and you're like,
Oh, there's that fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, Oh, you know, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, I really like plants a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, even things that people might
go, Oh, that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody will tell you, Oh, I can't stand
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stand Jack or I can't stand train
wreck or I can't stand a blue dream or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I hate, uh, I hate whatever it is that
they really don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of, I kind of like weed,
like, you know, I can tell you what's
[SPEAKER_01]: really gnarly and what's not as gnarly,
but a lot of the stuff that's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still kind of like, uh, I'm still kind
of just impressed that it's weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that makes any sense, like it's
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't want to be that guy,
but like, if somebody has some weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Hey, that's some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember times when, like I was saying,
like somebody has some moldy weed and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, even though I, you know,
I have access to what people consider to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the, what's the goods and, and what's
not, I still, um, that's there's that one
[SPEAKER_01]: type that just leaves, it leaves a bad
taste in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like the memories of it as like weed,
as far as cause it's a strain that I can
[SPEAKER_01]: really put a finger on and go that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, you know,
I don't think that, um, I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: anything's too terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think honestly, if you were on a desert
Island and someone dropped you off with
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, you'd be like, fuck,
I'm glad this is cannabis, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So onto our final question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could go back in time to anywhere,
any place and collect some seeds or a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone, which one are you going to go back
and get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I think last time I said I'd like
to go like to the Hindu Kush region back
[SPEAKER_01]: in the day, um, and hunt around and look,
um, so we already know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So outside of that, man, we have this
white widow in the, in the nineties,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have this Northern lights in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had this dirt perp clone in the
fucking nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't realize how good it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had already killed the moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for me personally, I would say I'd
probably want to go back right to that
[SPEAKER_01]: little slice of time when I still had all
three of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I know that there was tons of
people who had other stuff that I was too
[SPEAKER_01]: shy to ask for, I'd probably just write,
go back to the nineties in this area,
[SPEAKER_01]: grab the stuff that I had and that I lost,
and then start knocking on my friend's
[SPEAKER_01]: doors and asking their parents for the
stuff that I was too shy to ask for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and I know there's a lot of
other places to go and there's all kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of neat stuff to find, but like those are
the things for me personally, as opposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to going, you know, these are the things
that really should be brought to the
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to, I would, I would want to
go back and just get the shit that I have
[SPEAKER_01]: seen that we had that I smoked and I had
my hands on and I remember it and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would probably be like 1996 or
something like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, you know, the first episode,
we got seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second episode, we got clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of rounds it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds too though, when I'm talking about
that, those, you know, that's the,
[SPEAKER_01]: for me, there was those few clones,
but then I'd want to go get all those
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds from the, from the, from the family
friends, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, yes, yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, I think that just
about brings us to the end of a second
[SPEAKER_00]: monster episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for taking the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any comments or shout outs you
wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, man, I don't know, you know,
I could go, I could go lots of directions
[SPEAKER_01]: with that, but I'm going to, I think I'm
just going to probably, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: say thanks for everybody who listened to
all this crazy fucking run on sentences
[SPEAKER_01]: and rants and, and, you know, thanks to
everybody who's interested in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plants and trying to figure out you
know, what, what to do in the whole scene
[SPEAKER_01]: of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, thanks for having me
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that's a pretty,
pretty, uh, positive way to, to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, close it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
