[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: As always, good to have you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, doing stuffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, not bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had like probably the first dab I've had
in probably years last night.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like I have a bong over so hard
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not going away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like it was good in the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, yeah, I'm pretty high
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can because it's like sometimes when you
talk to people who don't smoke weed often,
[SPEAKER_04]: they say that they like, oh, the next day
you feel real foggy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, I feel that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tolerance is good and down, but I save a
lot of money that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how about yourself?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you been able to partake in anything
or you still need to abstain for a bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely got to abstain for the
time being probably this time next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be I'll be good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I said that tolerance would be good
and new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be like the first time again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I'm jealous.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took a two week break about a year ago,
even two weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only imagine a year is going to be
so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember what happened the last time I
got off a paper and then I went and blazed
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit before I even played the second
poke out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I should probably left
that at one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was fucking blasted.
[SPEAKER_04]: When that happened last time, what was the
first thing you smoked?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it something where you were like,
oh, man, I'm just so itching for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I had an outdoor and by the time it
was chopped and ready, that was about the
[SPEAKER_01]: time when I was off the paper and it was
fucking some outdoor Jack the Ripper.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out Subcorp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man, he right when I got out,
he was like, yeah, I want some beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, please send them on the
send them on the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 48 hours later, they were popped,
you know, and ready to ready to rock and
[SPEAKER_01]: roll, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful stuff, beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we sort of fast forward now,
is there anything that sort of front
[SPEAKER_04]: runner in your mind where you're like,
once I'm able to, that's going to be the
[SPEAKER_04]: one I'm hitting first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been thinking through it
through my mind and I think, I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be some eagle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm screaming eagle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking like, oh, it should be some
free bird, but I think I'm going to go
[SPEAKER_01]: with the eagle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I still so fondly remember that
eagle from years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if they're all like this,
but the one I tried from you, it was like
[SPEAKER_04]: had that sort of citrus vibe to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like that rainbow candy,
lemony, citrusy like shit going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was the it's definitely a
dominant one amongst all the all the all
[SPEAKER_01]: the Finos, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of curiosity, I thought about this
years ago and I was looking at the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics and I was like, oh, man,
where did this flavor come from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in my mind, I was like,
I can't see the clear parent where it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, oh, it's from this.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it in your mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: That that purpley candy rainbow type thing
was coming from that from that 88 and then
[SPEAKER_01]: that that citrusy side, that was
definitely out of the airborne.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense, because I don't know
why, but for the longest time,
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, is this Kandahar got like
something funky going on in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And no, no, it was like I could like
distinctly face it, you know, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: from plays in each one individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, it's like the perfect
little blend of it was like harmony,
[SPEAKER_01]: symmetry thing going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, wow, that's super cool because
that that doesn't happen much where you
[SPEAKER_01]: get, you know, a good mix of flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's very rare thing and it
worked out really good that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, beautiful stuff, beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess the first thing to maybe clear the
air, although probably everyone's aware,
[SPEAKER_04]: is you recently got out of jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you be able to tell us a little bit
more about that, if you're willing to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was just was down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, you know, I was in the jail for a
while while I was, you know, going through
[SPEAKER_01]: the motions and, you know, fighting shit
and just waiting on them because like
[SPEAKER_01]: literally everything came to a screeching
halt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally the process like goes through a
whole lot quicker because they were
[SPEAKER_01]: shutting ports down and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So amongst every other thing that was,
you know, fucking up, that was that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stayed unusually long time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was just over a year just just
sitting there in the fucking jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I did that and, you know,
they come to you, you know, you can sign
[SPEAKER_01]: off, you know, whatever guilty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like kind of an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like once they got you there,
you're not getting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either you know, take the next
three to five years fighting up,
[SPEAKER_01]: spend shit tons of money and have your
pride and be like, yeah, see, I was right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, it's like you're the chances
of winning are not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have like a 99% conviction rate,
even if you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, no, you're wrong because we
say so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can either do that or, you know,
you can look at like the time and look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the maximum that you're that you're
looking at losing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking like, say,
24 to 30 months or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, all right, two and a half
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm already, you know, about a year
into that with good time and everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, be about another year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do I spend three to five years on the
shit ton of money staying here just to
[SPEAKER_01]: lose, you know, and and that ensures that,
hey, you're definitely going to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: high end either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, you know, you got to make
that call.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to put up your fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know like, you know, you need
business and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there comes a point where it's just,
you know, you're going to you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to get the fair shake at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I sign off, get fucking,
you know, plead guilty, get sentenced or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 29 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got like, you know, a year already,
you know, knocked off of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a good time and everything,
you know, it's like going to be another
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then it's like, all right, now you can
finally like start your journey and get
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to throw you on con air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to the, you know, go to prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's like an intermediate step.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a transit hub in Oklahoma,
but they closed it down because of COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was all maximum security state
joint that they had closed down and
[SPEAKER_01]: private corporation bought it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were just sticking us all there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were we were doing normally in transit,
you're doing like a day to three days,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this turned into many months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that place is just fucking off the
chain, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then once you get and shift out of
there, you get back on con air and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you hit your final destination,
which was Florence, Florence, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, just wrap it up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, got out on the second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good to get to be back and get a
hold of everybody, you know, see
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's good and everybody hitting you
up, you know, is it's real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of love out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty, pretty awesome thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's so fantastic to hear you're
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure a lot of the community sort of
rallied behind that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to clarify, because I know a lot of
people had asked, are you willing to
[SPEAKER_04]: disclose with us why you entered?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ended up going to jail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess telling you earlier,
it's like it's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the Internet and read all about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all the all the sentencing shit
and everything fell into possession of a
[SPEAKER_01]: firearm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like somebody like, why, why,
why?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like straight up, you know,
it's a fucking crazy place.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are shooting up fucking Walmarts
and fucking whacking people and fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: grocery stores and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was very adamant, I'm not
going to be that guy that's going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking shot up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to watch a bunch of,
you know, random people just get fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: mowed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: My family's not going to get fucking hurt
or friends are not going to get hurt if
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you know, they'll say
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather I'd rather get caught with it
than without it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, you know, got caught with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that's the that's the price
price that you pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, was it a good decision?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's, you know, given the the the
way the climate was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of it's a gamble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same note, it was fucking going
nuts, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I made my decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stand by it and, you know, had to go
away, do my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I can say, you know,
I did my time and walk around with my with
[SPEAKER_01]: my head up and my shoulders back,
you know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't can't make that risk anymore
because then they hit you look like that
[SPEAKER_01]: repeat, repeat offender basically is what
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and then that's too much time to look
at, you know, like you can look at it like
[SPEAKER_01]: a risk and reward thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it would just be too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just have to keep it at a keep it at
a knife and just, I guess, stay away from
[SPEAKER_01]: Walmart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my civilization, I guess,
if you know, yeah, world's this world's
[SPEAKER_01]: going crazy, you know, except,
you know, put the coin toss and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: all right, fuck it, got to go to the
grocery store, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, look, that's that's brilliant to
get clarification on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of people can understand
where you're coming from with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, as you said, the world's
going crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And something I specifically wanted to ask
is you've, for better or worse,
[SPEAKER_04]: been away pretty much all through covid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to ask you specifically,
I remember seeing some news stories about
[SPEAKER_04]: how people in jails weren't really being
protected or looked after properly in
[SPEAKER_04]: regards to covid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any sort of experiences or
insights around that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's flat out like, you know,
your your society's unwanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just cut and dry, man,
they don't give a fuck about you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can live, you can die.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in human storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just you're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that everyone owns a cold
blooded piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some caring people, but even
even if they do, the rest of that machine
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't going to cater to that one person.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this guy's drowning as in one
fluid over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to get him out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, well, we'll look into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a pencil man or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they were just it was it's pretty
bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's framing up, you know, people
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got to the point where like
especially right when it happened,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just like looking in the unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even want to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is looking like it's a room full of
zombies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just let everything fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like normally, like there's a big
fight or some people stabbing each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to run in and stop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just is ran ran fucking rampant.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, there were times where they
weren't even beating us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even want to come near the
door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they were just scared shitless,
you know, about this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: thought of it, you know, spreading around
pretty, pretty rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just had guys trying to look out
for guys to do the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's nothing you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not the extent of it is
like try to get them some water out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: toilet sink and make sure that at least
they got things stay hydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really not much else to do as
medications or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just kind of just watch them die or
get really sick and slowly recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about it's about the end of
that, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, it really does sound as bleak as lot
like what many of the news reports said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was it was really, it was really
bad, man, really, really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, there'd be a TV on and
the whole time it's on, they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking death toll number just going up,
going up, going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's just sitting there
thinking like, oh, fuck, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is it, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're stuck in here and there's nothing
nobody can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was it wasn't looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely was not good for for
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, you know,
this can't be this can't be the fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it can't go down like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you just just kind of cross
your fingers and hope for the best and
[SPEAKER_01]: hope you don't be able to catch that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're crammed in so fucking close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in this one unit, there's like 80
fucking people and there's two toilets,
[SPEAKER_01]: two fucking toilets, one for pissing and
one for shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nothing around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like kind of sitting on the
floor and there's industrial ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't hit the button.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a huge aerosol effect up in the
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's spreading shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no soap available, you know,
like to give to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people have got no money or whatever
they can even afford to get some soap to
[SPEAKER_01]: take a shower alone and wash your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a filthy, black, filthy fucking
place too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, well, you know,
it's definitely definitely not looking
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't end up I didn't end up catching
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking, thinking like,
you know, as father nears me and I like
[SPEAKER_01]: him recuffing everything in that fucking
workflow that would go around every year,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, like I built up some type of
super immunity or some shit like I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God, you know, I didn't catch that
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who would have thought all those years of
hitting random joints and blunts might
[SPEAKER_04]: have paid off for the cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about everybody else,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I thought about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know, I've been exposed to
a lot of fucked up shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe my immune system will stay rock
solid and I won't get this shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we look very happy to hear you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't end up contracting it yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's sort of funny you mentioned
that because when like sort of in the
[SPEAKER_04]: early stages of when Covid came out,
a research paper came out from China,
[SPEAKER_04]: which basically showed that people who
smoke cigarettes are at a reduced chance
[SPEAKER_04]: of contracting the virus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I won't go too much into the details,
but basically one of the receptors in your
[SPEAKER_04]: lungs gets downregulated from smoking
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the same receptor the virus
uses to enter the cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a lot of controversy around
like, do we announce this because we're
[SPEAKER_04]: worried, you know, is everyone going to
start smoking to avoid Covid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say this public health
service announcement sponsored by Philip
[SPEAKER_01]: Morris.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sponsored by Philip Morris.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, look, obviously having never
experienced it myself, I say this with a
[SPEAKER_04]: grain of salt, but I'm sure there's rarely
an abundance of overwhelmingly positive
[SPEAKER_04]: things to occur from being in jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was wanting to ask you, did you have
any sort of revelations or insights?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any sort of new views on life you
feel like you've sort of developed since
[SPEAKER_04]: having had this experience and now being
free?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like the first time, because after the
first time, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get all that self-reflection
time and see things, do things,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you get out and, you know,
everything smells better, tastes sweeter,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I already had that and that never,
that never went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of it, you know, I've always tried to
make the best of every day, no matter what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing or where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just took the time to come up with
ideas and I was doing a lot of writing at
[SPEAKER_01]: night time when it was doors locked and
it's safe and quiet and you're able to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, I was working on working on
writing a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said this coming up with a was a good,
good, solid game plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I hit it back home, you know,
I could I could hit the ground running and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like on the last bit,
it's the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that ever gets locked up,
you know, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really get to see who's with you and
who ain't with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's the same every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got to see that on the last
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to see it on this one, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was good to like, you know,
you see where people really stand.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like really, really with you,
you know, ride or die motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that are against you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, of course, they're going to take
those opportunities to hate or talk shit
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to have people that
you thought were going to be there that
[SPEAKER_01]: end up not being there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people say, you know,
it's a bummer, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, it's hurtful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, it's like,
well, fucking imagine going through life
[SPEAKER_01]: with people that you think are like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to find out that they're not way
later down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always I'm actually, you know,
I'm a thankful, thankful person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just it's good to know, you know,
so that way when I do move on,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, I know who's who.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's a great that's a great
fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of all of it, yeah, just,
you know, time management coming up with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, things to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, there's a little
working out, you know, the normal shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Writing that was full and just,
you know, saying like that's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got some real solid motherfuckers in my
corner, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so many relevant topics you just
touched on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll come back and touch on some of the
other other ones shortly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I did want to follow up quickly on
your book.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you really generated a bit of a
buzz because many people like myself have
[SPEAKER_04]: seen, you know, little bits and tibets of
the book come out through you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe you've posted a soil mix here,
maybe you've posted something else there.
[SPEAKER_04]: When do you anticipate it might be
finished and what sort of things can
[SPEAKER_04]: people hope to learn from this book?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I hate to put a timeline on it
because like it's all written,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I got to type it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: My spelling is just a cautious man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm just horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many grammatical errors,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so I'm guessing, you know,
like between typing it all back up,
[SPEAKER_01]: fixing all that, continuing to add to it
because there was like some a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things I didn't have access to some art
supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of things I wanted to
draw.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember my old sketches and
everything I would draw up when I include
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good charts and like things that I really
need access to like a printer and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the computer to do certain
charts and things like that because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like a big it's a reference type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a how-to plus a reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to put all that together and
then got to, you know, have somebody look
[SPEAKER_01]: at it, you know, last, you know,
outside eyes, do any editing needed after
[SPEAKER_01]: that, then go through to the public and
some and I couldn't put a definitive
[SPEAKER_01]: timeline on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what people can look out of it is like
if you were and maybe not necessarily new
[SPEAKER_01]: to growing, but you're setting up a new
spot, you know, guiding people through
[SPEAKER_01]: literally setting up the space just to
begin with plumbing, electrical,
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching a little bit of electrical,
electrical theory, like things safety,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so it's like if you got to delve
into some electrical, you can go to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're comfortable with it,
then by all means, you can you can go
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you just want to know, you got your
friend doing it, that's cool, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But literally setting up the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: For success, before you even get started,
because so many people would just jump
[SPEAKER_01]: right into a space and start duct tape and
super glue and Velcro and all around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're struggling the whole time
and never catch up because they didn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, do the important thing first,
get the space straight, the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, well, makes us a couple of different
regimens that people could choose from,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on your, you know, what's in
your pocket availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make some math or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But trying to keep it very definitive,
like this isn't like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're reading this, it's like,
just do this, do this, do this,
[SPEAKER_01]: do this, do it this way, do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't deviate from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: After you do it, then at least you got you
got a good baseline of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do said, OK, well, I want to try
this, try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least, you know, like, hey,
this did better.
[SPEAKER_01]: This did worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you at least have your baseline?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good for the like to the new the
new person want to want to get into the
[SPEAKER_01]: organics and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, like a lot of references and shit
like that to, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a metric metric conversion tables and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it comes in handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we all got smartphones and shit
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes it's good just to have it
have a book real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just highlight it or go right back
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a nutshell, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to include some of the other
writing I did with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's just too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just keep that as one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other book just keep that as,
you know, a book, a book all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you say writings, what sort of
writings are we talking like Unibomber
[SPEAKER_04]: Manifesto type stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, man, just personal, personal stories,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thoughts and I showed about variety,
variety of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world seen through another another set
of eyes and a crazy brain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the the modern day Marcus Aurelius
meditations.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds it sounds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to put it out there now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everyone knows I officially called dibs
on editing the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man, you'd be my editor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to do it, do it like, you know,
like it's cool because like I still use
[SPEAKER_01]: use like color and favorite and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cool because I think y'all still
do that over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll work out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the fan submitted questions we got
was they sort of wanted to know,
[SPEAKER_04]: first of all, was it going to be a more
general or a specific book about growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you sort of answer it's going to be
more general.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be like laying out all the
options and people choose their own path.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one question that did get asked was
for some of your more notable strains,
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly people were asking about the
hoodoo.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's just become a really
popular one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will you maybe provide like a specifically
dialed in sort of info page or do you just
[SPEAKER_04]: want to keep it quite broad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with something like a book like
that, you kind of you kind of got to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: it broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with with every pack that they got,
there were like specific tidbits always on
[SPEAKER_01]: the back of every pack, like what to do
week to week if you needed to supplement
[SPEAKER_01]: more or less or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can kind of, you know,
if they just if you were to stick to like
[SPEAKER_01]: the baseline of like how I'm growing in
this book, and it's not going to deviate
[SPEAKER_01]: from what I'm personally doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a person isn't deviating from that,
your environments, you know, in this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, span of acceptable, the same as
mine, ultimately, at the end, if you do
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, as I said, me and this other
person, we should have the same result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything in detail that I would write
about it was already, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was already on the back of that pack
card.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one of the things people
view you as notable for was giving that
[SPEAKER_04]: really sort of in-depth information around
the cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the final sort of fan submitted
question we got around this topic was they
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of asked the question of along the
lines of like, you know, there's so many
[SPEAKER_04]: different ways you can skin a cat in
relation to growing organically.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just sort of wondering,
obviously, you've got your own style.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any thoughts on the
alternative styles of growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, I know that you don't do
like a pure no-till thing, but you do
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously do organic amended bases.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any thoughts on the other
styles or do you think it's just personal
[SPEAKER_04]: preference sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Personal preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like what works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've just like I said,
whatever person wants to do all means like
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever works for you and your space on
your budget, like no two people are
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I just know I like the way the
way I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've tried, you know, different other
ways that felt that for my space and my
[SPEAKER_01]: style and, you know, what I was doing was
working best for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, and that's the thing is like,
there's like so many ways of skin a cat
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of people will get info from
here and info from there and they kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: model it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it runs them into a jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I was like, I wanted just to
keep it very definitively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the differences is like,
like I'm talking about different
[SPEAKER_01]: approaches to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say different approaches,
it might just be, you know, here's a
[SPEAKER_01]: regimen, but the alternative that if you
don't have any money, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do this and still get to that
same, same part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even alternatively to that,
if it's a dire emergency and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be more with, you know,
fixing problems is like, here's a source
[SPEAKER_01]: of this that you can go to that could be
found at a grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things, things like that, little MacGyver
shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's going to be very helpful,
I think, because a lot of people will find
[SPEAKER_04]: them in those situations.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the, it's sort of an
obvious question to us, but I want to ask
[SPEAKER_04]: it in a sense is, you know, people are
also curious on top of my own interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you plan in the future to return to
your breeding, to get Dominion back up and
[SPEAKER_04]: running, or do you plan to do things
slightly different to how they were before
[SPEAKER_04]: you left?
[SPEAKER_04]: When the time's right, that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when the time's right,
yeah, full speed ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just taking my time through it
and not being in a rush and putting out,
[SPEAKER_01]: putting out good work for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I got a lot of other,
you've already heard, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of other projects like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You even inspired me and we'll do my own
little podcast, but it's going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going to be a way, way
different type approach and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not going to be 100% HANA based,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just know, you know, I'm not a lot of
interesting, not a lot of interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: people talk about different shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like we're all into all types of
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that the scene or industry or
whatever you're into.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, people just look down like
tunnel vision, like, oh, that's all this
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, no, like I had so many
other things surrounding this in my life
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, I like to do and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, you, you know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, I'm in all types of cool
different little hobbies and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had interest in fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I think a lot of other people are
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just that while we're talking
about something we're really passionate
[SPEAKER_01]: about, that's all that really gets brought
up, you know, but once you really get to
[SPEAKER_01]: talking and knowing somebody might find
out, you know, man, they were a
[SPEAKER_01]: professional bass fisherman or whatever,
you know, you just, you never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, from biochemist, uh, you know,
I can all, and they'll just have to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and, uh, I don't think that it's
suspenseful.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have, do you plan to just sort of
some point in the future or any sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: plans specifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in the near future, I'm going to
start working on it, but I'm going to jam
[SPEAKER_01]: a few hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I ever start putting them out that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't miss any like lapses that
way every week, you know, people can look
[SPEAKER_01]: forward to it being there, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a follow-up question to the breeding
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people were interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have access to, you know,
some of the old genetics, some of the old
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds, some of the old clones,
or do you envision that when you do get
[SPEAKER_04]: things back up and running, it'll be sort
of a fresh start, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I still have, all, everything I
had, um, backed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and I, and I did it in a
fail safe fashion too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like in two places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anything happened to one,
the other one, the other one had it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause you know, life happens,
shit happens, especially when you eat
[SPEAKER_01]: regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I still have all,
all that, all that stuff to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: continue any future work along lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might've already dealt them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to continue on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a bunch of projects that I had to
put on hold that a lot of final steps were
[SPEAKER_01]: done and it was ready for that,
that, that final, that final thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, we, uh, I don't know,
man, like it's just, I got a lot of plans
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know, me, I don't, I don't like
to, uh, I don't like to give too much out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to show my hand too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know how it is out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like people are, uh, always looking to
copy or empty rip off or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, there's going to be some,
there's going to be some new, some new
[SPEAKER_01]: things that, uh, I don't know how to say
it without giving it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll just have to wait and see.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, on that train of thought,
I think there's probably a lot of people
[SPEAKER_04]: who in the community have been sitting on
some of your packs for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering, do you have any
recommendations for people, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like if they're sitting on a certain
thing, like, Oh man, you should really pop
[SPEAKER_04]: that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, if you ever came to a show
or talk to me personally, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you know, what should I get?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say, well, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what are you lacking in life?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you, what are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I'd go from there because of
a medical necessity or a certain smell of
[SPEAKER_01]: taste you're looking for, you know,
and go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say just, uh, you know,
did pretty, I did a pretty good job on
[SPEAKER_01]: descriptions and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, kind of just look at and see what
you, what you, what you, what you want,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're lacking in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and, you know, just go from
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say like, if you just spend
sitting on them for a real long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, maybe get, if you got one that's like
real old, maybe get those, get those pop
[SPEAKER_01]: and purr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're not getting any younger,
but outside of that, man, just,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, just stick with, uh, stick with your
gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you're, what you want in there,
what you want and need right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause obviously they bought them for some,
some kind of reason, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look, you gave me a great segue there
because specifically, obviously all of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Dominion releases have been very
successful, but specifically I've had a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of people message me and tell me that
they've found some golden stuff out of
[SPEAKER_04]: their, the vault series.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I'm wondering, do you have any
future plans for sort of some vault stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: to, or do you think it'll be more like the
strict Dominion stuff going forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that could happen again,
but a lot of the vault stuff was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you had things that may have been intended
like, all right, you know, I want to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to, I want to work this line or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go and you try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make, you make a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find a male out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to go to the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, wow, that totally did not
work out at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the original hybrid that she made
for that male, the females fucking make,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it was like, well, they're not
going to do anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: That project's not going to move forward
any, any more, but the shit all,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the side was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, let's go ahead and let some,
let some people, people enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was kind of the whole,
the whole thing with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know specifically something I wanted to
ask you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I already know the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm a, I'm a, I'm sort of cheating
myself here, but I remember you made some
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrids with specifically you did the
eugenics male to the skunk Northern
[SPEAKER_04]: lights, five females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, that, that female like, cause I
found a clone in those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in my opinion, it was one of my best
clones for ages.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sadly I lost it when I was moving,
but I just thought, man, if there's ever
[SPEAKER_04]: another chance for me to find like a
female like that, I would jump on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have access to that sort of plant
anymore?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it, is it gone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I give them some seeds to a friend
that said they had a bunch of stuff of
[SPEAKER_01]: mine and they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when, when I get around to him,
I got a fucking Amish buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves that shit too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a long story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like back when I was working on a steel
mill in Pennsylvania, he was getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: weed out of this bar and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ever since then he's been kind of stuck
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I get to those, I have to make
sure that a Queens mail finds it,
[SPEAKER_01]: finds their way to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, you're, you're too kind.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're, you're too kind.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why this jumped into my head,
but for some reason it did when you were
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of talking about where you've been in
the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering, I'm not sure if you've
been like a hundred percent up to date
[SPEAKER_04]: with it all, but you know, did you have
any thoughts on the progression of the
[SPEAKER_04]: medical cannabis laws around Virginia?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, cause a lot of people have been
excited about that since it's happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was wondering, what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, it's a super awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say like just the biggest,
biggest thing I can say to them is like
[SPEAKER_01]: you fought hard to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There don't stop fighting because just
look at the history of every other state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll look at the progression of how,
how, how they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically the corporate and
government game plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they want to, they want to take,
take, take.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just look at the mistakes of everyone
before you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, fight, fight,
fight that plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, don't, don't let them take that
from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hard to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let them take it from me through the
guys of, you know, different rec laws and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they put a law in front of you and
like, don't, don't just have, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read the whole fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read the fine print devils in the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the second you forget
history, like that's when shit starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: repeat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so just stay very adamant,
stay very vigilant and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it, keep it strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know, I know how my bros
sisters are out in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they're a rowdy fucking bunch,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, they ain't gonna let
nothing go easily and just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: stay, stay vigilant and, uh, don't,
don't let them take shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some brilliant words of encouragement
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess as a followup, do you see a
time when you might head back to Virginia
[SPEAKER_04]: to do your breeding work or the laws just
not quite where they need to be to allow
[SPEAKER_04]: that yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, it's, it would still be a
little too early on, but I saw like,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the mode of action and like how,
how things are supposed to be implemented.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, it's going to be a couple of
years down the road before it's there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'll definitely be back there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, just hanging out and, you know,
just, you know, making trips and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before I get to get to move back to
the motherland, uh, yeah, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of years before it's,
or it's proper ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if we look at California under the
same sort of lens and sort of analyzing
[SPEAKER_04]: the legislation they've brought in,
a lot of people have been critical of two
[SPEAKER_04]: 15, including myself, I'm sure yourself
for like a long time in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And recently, uh, had Ed Rosenthal on the
show and he, he made an interesting point
[SPEAKER_04]: where he said, look, you know,
could the laws be better?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the end of the day, if you're
keeping people out of jail for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's a net win, no matter how much it
could be improved that you have to view it
[SPEAKER_04]: as a net win that we're keeping people out
of jail for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought given your recent sort of,
you know, uh, departure from jail,
[SPEAKER_04]: would you say that this is, you know,
as much as it might be a bit of taste in
[SPEAKER_04]: people's mouth, because there's a lot of
people who don't like the way their
[SPEAKER_04]: business has been affected because of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you agree with Ed Rosenthal in that
sense in saying that keeping people out of
[SPEAKER_04]: jail should probably be the number one
priority?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, of course, because like you're
saying the words legal, recreationally,
[SPEAKER_01]: legal, like the word legal, how in the
fuck is anybody going to jail every
[SPEAKER_01]: something they call legal?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's, that's kind of absurd to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, like, yeah, people definitely
should be, uh, be getting hauled off for
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, does it, does that happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, um, and you know,
maybe it's changed since they first
[SPEAKER_01]: implemented it, but um, like some grand
mids and a few other guys that are like
[SPEAKER_01]: real savvy with everything going on,
these laws and everything, they were like
[SPEAKER_01]: my go-tos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since I didn't live in the state
either, um, you know, I'm only going to
[SPEAKER_01]: know what, you know, what's being shown to
me and, you know, told to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, when they hadn't met or
whatever, um, I guess like when they went
[SPEAKER_01]: wreck, like some of the penalties for
certain things change and it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it was beforehand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I, um, I don't know if that
was in the proposal or if that's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: what went through a long time ago,
but I thought that, you know, I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, that's kind of kind of fucked up man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how is it going to be legal?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like somebody is going to get a
good as a fucking joint over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like fucked up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You, I mean, you raise a brilliant point
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's almost a contradiction,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The fuck is legal, but people still go to
jail, especially when you think about the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Sackler family, the, the guys who put
out what it's like oxy and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, those motherfuckers aren't
going to jail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet people with a few pounds,
a few plants over that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's such a contradictory, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, big time, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so yeah, like, yeah, definitely
believe like nobody should be tossed,
[SPEAKER_01]: tossed down over, over a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you want to like make the argument
like, wow, they're a non-regulated grower
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're growing and doing all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't, I don't see that as a
crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, but if they want to like,
you know, further it and say, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: the reason why is like, dude was making a
million dollars and not paying tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not paying taxes on revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like dude broke the law, whatever,
but you know, everything before that,
[SPEAKER_01]: like if you want to grow a fucking plant,
you should be able to grow a fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, you know, um, and that's just,
that's just my opinion on it, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that's, that's a very
insightful take for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one that's weird is like
Washington, DC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a state district of Columbia,
like when they make the laws and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, you know, it's where the white
house is and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since it's not a state, it's governed
by federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the other argument is like,
Oh, you know, and I'm going through that
[SPEAKER_01]: now it's the reason I can't blaze on my
federal probation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since we federally illegal,
um, they say it doesn't matter what the
[SPEAKER_01]: state is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feds are going to Trump over,
you know, what the state says.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how in the fuck is we'd still federally
illegal when it's recreationally legal in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, DC, the land governed by
federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: They riddle riddle me that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very contradictory, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very contradictory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just to think about it,
you know, and it's like, we're almost in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2022 and still having that, still having
that thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like why, like how, like how, how is this
still still a thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Do you foresee a time in the
near future when, you know, some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: inconsistencies get ironed out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think it's just going to nag
alone forever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think as long as you got a lot of,
a lot of the old guys that are still
[SPEAKER_01]: hanging in there, um, that are influenced
by pharma and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: lobbyists and everything, special interest
groups, you're going to have a lot of foot
[SPEAKER_01]: dragon, even though if they know damn
right, if they're dead wrong, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: still going to do it because you know,
money or promises, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to take a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those guys start getting out or
dying or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it's weird because like a
lot of the people that are law makers and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, they're like really old
people, really old, old school ways of,
[SPEAKER_01]: excuse me, old school ways of thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're kind of, um, you know,
they're kind of fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or, you know, I mean, it's like proven
fact, you know, they take all the special
[SPEAKER_01]: interest money and stuff and see where
that comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, of course, you know,
like Merck pharmaceuticals is like super
[SPEAKER_01]: huge and, you know, donate all this money
to this person.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very adamant about like,
Hey, you know, no, I don't think it should
[SPEAKER_01]: be legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, you know, the kids, because,
you know, actually it shows that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the smoking has gone
dramatically down the underage people,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, there's, there's some facts
for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, just, no, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, does that say so?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, maybe next time boys,
you know, that's a bit shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people are guided by just
feelings or religious views or contextual
[SPEAKER_04]: society stuff of like, yeah, it's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, uh, really, really insane,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially they keep people like fitted
against each other all the time too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, division, you know,
that's a good way to keep doing what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You keep people divided from coming
together and, you know, that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a, that's an old school trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: People still following for that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, maybe we just need to get our own
cannabis lobbyists and get some equal
[SPEAKER_04]: representation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be, that would be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, a lot of money for that and
a whole lot of money for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Millions and millions and millions and
millions of dollars that they're pumping
[SPEAKER_01]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you gotta be able to keep up with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the hard thing to do, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you sort of painted, uh,
and actually quite a clear picture in my
[SPEAKER_04]: mind there where a lot of people in the
community are really critical of brands
[SPEAKER_04]: that aren't striving to be the absolute
pinnacle.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we always hear about how people
say, Oh, if you want to be the bud light
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabis, go for it or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you sort of just made me realize maybe
we do need more of that so that there are
[SPEAKER_04]: people who can throw millions of dollars
at lobbyists because maybe, maybe that's
[SPEAKER_04]: what you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, the mass production mid
tier, because maybe, yeah, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, maybe jungle boys is never going
to do it themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think like that's the thing is
like people automatically associate
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody doing it big with meds because I
mean, you know, primarily, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's kind of how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not to say that there aren't going
to be some people that come up and just
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking kill it and do it the right way,
you know, um, you know, and do it and do
[SPEAKER_01]: it without any like outside, like
corporate money.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that self-start,
but, you know, that's the, that's the bad
[SPEAKER_01]: part about being a self-starter is like,
you don't have all these investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like fucking grinding out grass
roots to make it big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and there just hasn't been enough time
for a lot of these people to shine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out there slugging it out and like
they're, they're getting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, you know, that, that time's still
going to, that's still going to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, yeah, when you do get there
and it's not going to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he said the Bud Light a weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, you know, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's not to say somebody
can't, you know, take what they're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: and still keep quality high and then also
keep production high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a lot of the chads that had all
that big investment money that went in and
[SPEAKER_01]: just threw, you know, millions of dollars
at it and blew up big.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not, they're not graph type
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not really growers at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and they're just kind of hiring
mediocre people for a mediocre pay,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is going to end up being a mediocre
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's the same like skilled labor
isn't cheap, cheap labor isn't skilled and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're paying cheap, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get, you kind of get what you pay
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I think, I think we'll see a
change, you know, in the, in the near
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially you start looking like
states like Virginia coming online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there's a lot of foreign boys
there and girls that really know how to,
[SPEAKER_01]: they know how to do big things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a lot of hope and I got a lot of
faith, faith in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we just sort of, uh, change the topic
for a minute, I was hoping to get into
[SPEAKER_04]: some breeding stuff because probably the
majority of questions that were submitted
[SPEAKER_04]: by listeners were related to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, you know, if I sort of
amalgamate many of the questions slash
[SPEAKER_04]: concerns together, I think I can sort of
embody it with the question of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, have you changed your mind at
all in regards to the direction you want
[SPEAKER_04]: to take your breeding?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in the past you've always felt
that there's a certain importance around
[SPEAKER_04]: certain cultivars, like notably sort of
some of the chem family, the skunks,
[SPEAKER_04]: for example, you worked extensively with
some of these lines, 88G13.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that you're going to continue
with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That direction?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you have an inkling to welcome some
new blood into the Haram?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't have any, uh, anything really,
uh, against anything new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are going to be some new things,
but, um, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, yeah, definitely some of the
new, um, back then, you know, I just had,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had goals in mind and I start off with
what you want to goal and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had some, some things I wanted to
see, things I wanted to do and some goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked hard toward those goals and
then I made those goals happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, there's some, some that aren't,
aren't finished, you know, that I still
[SPEAKER_01]: got.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, well, you know, pick up there,
but yeah, there's a whole bunch of other
[SPEAKER_01]: things I'd like to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it involves some, some new
things, something new, something old.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is there any specific lines of
yours that you're really itching to get
[SPEAKER_04]: back into, or it's going to be more open,
platter and evaluate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well, I wanted to, uh, I wanted to
finish up primarily like a couple of,
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of projects that I had the,
I guess I was on that last step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to get them knocked out first
and foremost.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that point, um, I got a couple in
mind, but I guess I don't want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to show my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No understandable for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I had, um, some questions from
listeners who were hoping maybe you could
[SPEAKER_04]: give them a little bit more sort of,
of an explanation or just maybe some
[SPEAKER_04]: thoughts on some of the, the packs they
got from you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the ones that caught my eye was
someone was interested to know what are
[SPEAKER_04]: the differences in your mind between say
the skunk band and the dead band,
[SPEAKER_04]: given, you know, they are fairly similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one's, one's given more, more of the
narcotic knock down stone and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a difference in the flavonoids,
you know, more of the, more of the hashy,
[SPEAKER_01]: hashy, funky, or rag side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also like structure and girth like
heft to it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That dead band was definitely had the
more, the more heft to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, skunk band had more of that head band
type sour, uh, consistency to the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that band definitely had more of a
more of a knock down, knock down type
[SPEAKER_01]: stone too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful stuff there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any plans to re-release any of
the lines or you just want to focus on new
[SPEAKER_04]: things going forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there were certain things that I
made and I thought I made enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the problem was like, every,
not a problem, I guess a good problem is
[SPEAKER_01]: like people were really digging the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it was like, it was catching on as
I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, they get onto this new thing to
them, but it's like, it's been out for six
[SPEAKER_01]: months or a year and they're gone,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I was just all about moving
forward, moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there were certain ones that were
very exceptional that I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's, it's worthy of the time to,
you know, take it to an F3 or an F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four and, and put it, put it back out
there, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are, there are some of those that
I would definitely go that route with.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's going to be a hopeful
answer to a lot of people listening
[SPEAKER_04]: because I was going to say, I did a quick
little tally of the strains that got
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned from the listeners and the top
three that people had questions about or
[SPEAKER_04]: were just in general really excited about
was the pole cat back cross, which I think
[SPEAKER_04]: might sort of fall into the category you
just mentioned where, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: people only really, realized about it,
you know, months after the release.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the other two that made the list was
the local skunk and the hoodoo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Were those some of the lines that,
you know, you were thinking in that last
[SPEAKER_04]: answer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are definitely one scream and Eagle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, definitely would make the list
for me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause then you see like a lot of people
don't know, but people that do know they,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, that's definitely a,
another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's only so many people had
that one as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've, I've actually got a personal
question for you that I've been wanting to
[SPEAKER_04]: ask you for a while, but I never got the
opportunity, but basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pantene dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use pantene.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I use man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how you keep it silky smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I ended up growing out, uh, some of your
Chem D cross C99 feminized.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found this pheno, which to me is like
bang on Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just always was like, man,
that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Chem D and C99.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm getting this plant that has like
no real sativa characteristics or
[SPEAKER_04]: influence in the effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not only that, it sort of tastes and
looks like Chem 91 more than the Chem D.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it got me wondering, I was like,
do you think, you know, cause some people
[SPEAKER_04]: try to say maybe the Chem D actually came
from the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought that's the only thing I
could think of, which maybe explained it a
[SPEAKER_04]: bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any thoughts or do you just
think, look, Chem D and the Chem 91 are
[SPEAKER_04]: similar?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, D91, you know, being related,
you know, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, that is the correct line of
thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's take it back a step further.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was working with Princess,
when we were doing the, doing the Brothers
[SPEAKER_01]: Grimm thing, you, you smoked the bud and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You seen it, you seen it grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was no question in my mind that
that magical, you know, bag seed or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever was an NL hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that, that Princess reminded me a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, so when, when Sol or Sly,
who, whomever was doing that, they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they, they, they chose a male to start
that cubing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if she was skunk, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Northern Lights and skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, personally, I felt, always felt
like NL skunk would be a good nominee for
[SPEAKER_01]: the mystery pollen donor to make chem
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always my gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I still, still feel that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he takes that and he hits it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hits that princess.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does his cubing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you, you got those genes in the
pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and to me, like when I smoked
Princess, that the first time it was
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking kind of narcotic fucking weed,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got nothing, nothing's to keep out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically a shorter plant that stretch
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, it definitely doesn't scream
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with having those genes in the pool,
and then that ultimately that pollen that
[SPEAKER_01]: was used was just, I mean, you remember,
man, you, you've been to my shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw me growing it and doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had the bud, smelled the jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was fucking funky, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of, you know, like gassy,
fucking nasty, nasty smell to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like as close to that princess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't exactly like it by any means,
you know, but, you know, it was as close
[SPEAKER_01]: to it as I'd seen in any, anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having that as that pollen donor and
selfing that, that plant and using that
[SPEAKER_01]: reverse pollen to hit Chem D, you know,
it's passing, passing everything I could
[SPEAKER_01]: out of that, out of that original female
that, that could be passed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by getting all those genes back in that
pool, that doesn't, you know, it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: no, no surprise to me that you would see
phenos that are spot on, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some more like, you know, the,
the mother, you know, the Chem D,
[SPEAKER_01]: some being like, uh, the Cindy,
and then, you know, blends of the two ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that lean slightly one way or the other,
but also expressing the, the, the parents
[SPEAKER_01]: and the, and the, uh, the sisters,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that doesn't, doesn't surprise
me, surprise me at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's a brilliant explanation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I really resonate with how you
were describing princess as more of an
[SPEAKER_04]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, yeah, you definitely noticed that
disorientating factor of the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big time, big time, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would, it would slump you, slump you
back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's, it's only now that you say
it, that I think to myself, if no one ever
[SPEAKER_04]: told me and you put princess and genius,
like the buds, at least next to each
[SPEAKER_04]: other, I definitely would never have
thought they were related.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with, with genius, you know,
I was like, if I had my guests,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it reminded me so much of Secret Soul
Page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean so much, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, so that led me to think
like, Hey, maybe, you know, maybe it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, uh, maybe like an L and L Hayes or
something like that, that there was the
[SPEAKER_01]: donor, like, you know, telling them what,
what happened, you know, it's supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a bag of, you know, Jack air or
whatever, but you know, that, that mystery
[SPEAKER_01]: donor, uh, gave us something like,
like, uh, like princess and that one was
[SPEAKER_01]: so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if there was more donors,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if it wasn't just one donor,
there's multiple pollen sources.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's actually a possibility.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's never really been discussed very
much, has it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I sat there thinking many a night,
like this doesn't make any fucking sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, especially off such a small number of
seeds popped, you just wouldn't expect to
[SPEAKER_04]: see that variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this wasn't like, you know,
bud that he grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is purchased bud from a coffee shop
in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he used to say, like, it's not,
you know, a bunch of different buds
[SPEAKER_01]: homogenized in a, in a tray from a
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some plants were near one side of the
room and then the other side of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when I got hit with one,
when I got hit with the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: and one bud had some seed and the other
bud had some seed, but two different
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two different pollen donors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that might be a very well new
possibility, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it makes, makes sense to me,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I felt that, like I said, that the,
the genes was a lot like super silver haze
[SPEAKER_01]: and the, uh, the princess, I mean,
it was just totally, totally different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got me thinking now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're on the topic, I mean,
the last, the last episode we recorded
[SPEAKER_04]: together was a number of years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think at the time it was still
pretty fresh and raw.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we didn't really delve into it,
but a lot of people have been wondering
[SPEAKER_04]: for the longest time that the
circumstances in which you departed
[SPEAKER_04]: Brothers Grimm and a lot of rumors
floating around about sort of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, money being owed and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you be willing to set the record
straight on why you decided to part ways
[SPEAKER_04]: with Brothers Grimm and maybe some of the
circumstances?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the guy wasn't who I thought he
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that shit happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you talk to somebody on the
internet or whatever, that's one thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but being around somebody, seeing them in
their everyday life and working with them
[SPEAKER_01]: and seeing how they interact with people,
um, just, I guess, to be, uh, be as nice
[SPEAKER_01]: as I can about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't jive at all with the guy
and, um, just some really, really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really bad practices, um, ethics,
um, how he treated people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it just turned into like mess
after mess, after mess, um, problem after
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just talking, just dealing with
people here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it just got to that point where
it's just so frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then when it came to the work and
everything else, um, it just, it would,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would, there would be just things that
would really, really, really, really piss
[SPEAKER_01]: me off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it got to the point was like,
just, just please just handle,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, uh, talking to vendors and
stuff like that, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: please don't, don't just start cussing at
them and flipping out on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like somebody owes you something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, quit being cocky, quit the egotistical
stuff, be a little more humble,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'll handle, I'll handle this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the right guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you, you know, you got it,
you got to tighten up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, if you're going to go out,
you do these shows, you handle the banking
[SPEAKER_01]: and the shipping and all, um, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool by me because that's what you
like to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you like these shows and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, do, do you, you know, stick to stick
to that, but just when you're doing these
[SPEAKER_01]: shows, like, please stop offending people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every time you're at a show,
my DM box fills up like this fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: prick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will not believe what he said or what
he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, this, you know, I could go on with
story at the store at the story of people
[SPEAKER_01]: at shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where I would go and they would just
straight up come up to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, yeah, I had this big fat
water money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted all this for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot rightly buy this from you,
knowing that any of that money is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: go to like, to that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd have to like, I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it just very rude guy, you know,
I don't know how else to put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just got to the point where like,
even like him just doing shows was just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just a bad, just a bad deal,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, this is just something I
can't, I can't continue, um, being
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I can't really be around this dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the thing is like around me,
like to me personally, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't, he wasn't like that,
you know, it's just the other people,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, it just a very, very frustrating,
very frustrating thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so I decided I was like,
look, man, um, at one point he's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, I want to, I want to bring on this
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he wants to buy, um, you know,
part of the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants to, you know, be doing this,
that this and that, um, and we need to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just, you just came from a show
where I got a whole DM box full of,
[SPEAKER_01]: full of messages saying like, you're
blowing them off, being rude to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you couldn't be bothered because
you're flirting with some girl in the
[SPEAKER_01]: booth next to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, furthermore, you couldn't be
bothered to drop the seeds off at the
[SPEAKER_01]: hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you parked it in some restaurant and
busted your glass and got all that stolen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're coming back with some guy I
don't even know or never met saying he's,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's buying his way into the company and
this is what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it's been quite a bit over
this, over this weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was already at my edge anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, I'll tell you what,
how about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You buy whatever you want and you,
uh, Rick, you're, you're, you can buy the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, um, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're going to do, if you're cool
with this, you got bankers and lawyers and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have them draft up a good contract,
figure out whatever his percent was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use that as a multiplier for, you know,
50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, give me that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about two days later, he comes out,
he's got a contract or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at it and I'm like,
all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that'll work, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and as, you know, it's pretty cut
and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sign off on it.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, payment one happens, you know,
upon execution and, and asked for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that's a good chunk of money,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we'll, we'll split this down
into quarters, you know, over,
[SPEAKER_01]: over a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, it makes it easy for you to
continue doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, do whatever type of marketing,
whatever, man, do y'all, um, y'all got
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you got this cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So time for payment to comes around and
he's like, Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like sales are down this and that I'm
like, look, dude, the last post we had on
[SPEAKER_01]: media, um, you posted one post.
[SPEAKER_01]: After all these months and it was middle
of the evening on day two at a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: How in the fuck do you think that's,
that's promotion, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go down like this list of like 13 or
so things like this is what you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do this instead, do this instead,
do this instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, but look, you know,
all jokes aside, like you need to pay me
[SPEAKER_01]: my money like flat out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some time, like some weeks or whatever,
but, but he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on the next one, he's just flat out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't feel that I owe you anything
and I'm just, I'm not, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: pay you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, that's, that's not going
to happen, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you can't go and buy a
fucking NASCAR race car, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're buying that to, to compete,
but you don't know how to race a race car.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't tell people that you suck as a
fucking race car driver and you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, Oh, I'm not paying you
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I can't win.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pay like whatever failures are
happening, that's on you right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing any new work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not promoting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime you do talk to people,
they're, they're incredibly offended.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're, you're not going good for a
lot of other reasons, which none of which
[SPEAKER_01]: have anything to do with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's just like, yeah, yeah,
not, not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm like, well, I need to need to
figure some, figure some things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, um, that's where,
that's where it ended off was,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, right there and, uh, just trying to,
you know, figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I'm not big on courts and,
and going, going that route, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, if you go the alternative route,
you're going to find yourself in court
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway, through something altogether
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, so I don't know,
um, you know, maybe try to talk to the
[SPEAKER_01]: dude again, now that I'm, now that I'm
home and then, you know, I have to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: it out from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, you know, I really don't like
going through, uh, any type of court court
[SPEAKER_01]: system and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I've just always been like,
you know, you should just be a man of your
[SPEAKER_01]: word and honor, honor your agreements and,
you know, do it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then at the same time,
I'm looking, I'm like, wow, you're buying
[SPEAKER_01]: an awful lot of lavish shit for a guy that
doesn't make any money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't have much, uh, much time to be
in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he said, hopefully I'll talk to him
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, maybe shit's changed or maybe has a
different outlook on, on things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but we'll just have to have
to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: That provides a lot of clarity to the
situation and like he's still selling shit
[SPEAKER_01]: that I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like back then, like somebody showed me
the other day, yeah, like one eight seven
[SPEAKER_01]: for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just renamed it, murdered my
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like old seed stock that I
was supposed to get paid for that never
[SPEAKER_01]: did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, somebody showed me he was like,
yeah, I had a Polcat F twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, yeah, name the strain and
I'll give you a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And somebody like pop them in his area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a name for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about Duke's work?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Oh, golden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the name ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how they, you know, that's how they
operate, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, from outside looking in like,
and I'm not like a drama guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to like air out a bunch of
shit like on, you know, Instagram or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, I can handle these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by that same token, though,
is like, people don't, don't know who and
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on because a lot of those
people, they mess with him, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're all newer people, you know,
they know who the fuck I am, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is fine, you know, but, um,
they, they have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of, you know, what the past has been and
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, nobody's a mind reader.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so it's like, you know, one of them
things like the air that out, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the place, or do you just,
you know, just work through it and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, call it, call it a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't want to like put a bunch of
negative, negative shit on there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially if it's something I just
need to hash out with a person
[SPEAKER_01]: individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I'm going to, I'm going to
do that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's just the way,
the way I was brought up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, you know, but I guess,
you know, like I said, I'm glad you,
[SPEAKER_01]: glad you asked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause, um, after all these years and
everything, uh, yeah, bigger fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you might as, might as well let
people know, know what's up with the dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, maybe, maybe the,
the silver lining of this is that we did
[SPEAKER_04]: have a lot of people ask, will we ever see
Cap G again?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was one of the most hottest
strains when it hit the scene that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only 40, uh, 40 packs of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you remember at the, at the show,
man, like it was, it was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of it was even like spoken
for, like right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, with, uh, with that going on,
it was weird because later it was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I saw like, you know,
it seemed like 200, uh, 200 packs of it in
[SPEAKER_01]: circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's, uh, that's a coincidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was very peculiar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but the thing I was with that,
um, it was, it was just a beginning step,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, moving forward to making that
dominion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I don't, I don't feel like,
you know, back it all the way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I kind of hit my goal,
you know, where I wanted to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, as a bit of a follow-up and it
might be hard for you to pick just one,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I was curious to know, what do you
think is the most under-recognized
[SPEAKER_04]: dominion?
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of quality, where like,
you know, maybe the sales don't reflect
[SPEAKER_04]: it, but it's truly a killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, they were, man, they were quite a,
they were quite a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the granny skunk was one with the
Virginia beach Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that one was fucking killer,
but nobody knew it Virginia beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was, it's like, people only know
what they want based off the kind of what
[SPEAKER_01]: they like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that wasn't like some big circulated
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people in Virginia would beat it up
because everybody knows, I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the fuck that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everybody else like, yeah,
I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just keep it, keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Oh, well, Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, I know I've heard that one before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll go, go that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was probably the most, the most slept
on one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's, that's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember having smelled that and it was,
it was almost equally as impressive as the
[SPEAKER_04]: cap G, but I think many people smell that
cap G and were just sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like nasty, garlicky rubber,
skunky funk to it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, that was some good, that was
some good shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that was something that,
that was lacking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was going like super fruity shit
and, you know, going just for like
[SPEAKER_01]: straight, straight down, you know,
um, at the time at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, something different,
you know, and something that hadn't been,
[SPEAKER_01]: hadn't been in plenty, I guess,
you know, for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool to be like, yeah, you know,
those, those types of things, but still,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, strike a, strike a thing with
people's nose and be like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, that's something I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so along with all the,
all the work coming after that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, you know, projects I did along with
it, it was cool to see like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's not just me or a group of
friends that are digging it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of people are digging it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after I've come back, I've had so many
people are like, they bought all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuffed up, but they didn't pop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people were popping back and they
DM box filled up, like most amazing shit
[SPEAKER_01]: ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking skunky, fucking gas chem
shit that I got going on with this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going out or, you know, just a lot of
good success stories, happy people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, yeah, I bought them just
because, and yeah, it's been kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This just now years later, you know,
getting into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool to see all that good feedback,
you know, I was getting some from people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, immediately jumping into the
work, but there was so much more than just
[SPEAKER_01]: people were sitting on it and now coming
back and then showing me pictures that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, from last year or whatever year
before, or here recently, just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, this is killer, you know,
people with the hoodo, polecat,
[SPEAKER_01]: stash plant, purple dais, like,
uh, sangria is all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's fucking like, man, please keep
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm down whenever you're ready.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just named a few strains I wanted
to ask you about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But before we get there, I just want to
quickly loop back because you mentioned
[SPEAKER_04]: the VA Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually had a few people ask about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the sort of common thread was,
do you have any information on the
[SPEAKER_04]: backstory around it at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, like that's always been like,
uh, like a mystery, mystery plan,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, I'm going to do a live on it
at some point with a few different people
[SPEAKER_01]: from back home.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they can, they can talk freely on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but man, there's so many, there's so
many stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, as with any, anything,
anything, any Lord, man, you got,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got a whole lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I always felt it's a whole lot simpler
than, you know, a Vietnam vet and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I can't say, uh, that's a new word,
a little person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like there's been some fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy stories I heard, but I think at the
end of the day, it's just some old seed
[SPEAKER_01]: bank, uh, Afghani stocks and got down to
really, really killer ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the best of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like anything else that's real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's been around that long,
the reason why, you know, people aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: going to risk, uh, you know, getting
hemmed up and going to prison over some,
[SPEAKER_01]: over some swag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but it stood the test of time,
which I think is sort of a testament to
[SPEAKER_04]: its, its quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strong shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely remember the first time I
tried it with you and it was everything
[SPEAKER_04]: you said, you know, very sort of paranoia
inducing for an Afghani, which was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just, I just want to shut,
you just want to sit down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we had a, someone who hails from VA as
well, asked the question, did you ever try
[SPEAKER_04]: the Skylar skunk from Nelson, Virginia
back in the day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned that on a couple of
shows, I mentioned it once, like before I
[SPEAKER_01]: even went away and I kind of had a slip.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, what's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing to see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, yes, yes, I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, had a, had a buddy that used to
live out that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, he, he knew the old dude
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they got, they got the clone of
it and all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, fucking, fucking killer dude,
but more on that later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is it, is it like a standard
skunk, but better or is it very,
[SPEAKER_04]: is it sort of different to a normal skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's definitely more, more on the
Indica side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, aside from the strong smells and all
that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, very, very, very strong narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, doesn't grow huge stretchy type
plants, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's definitely, definitely more
in that blend of lean in a little more on
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, on the Indica side of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, just absolutely fucking stanky
man, the stinker, you know, it's got that
[SPEAKER_01]: lingering effect too on the mouth,
like a, I kind of like coffee bean hashy,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, slight skunk flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, to it and it kind of lingers almost
like that sour diesel effect a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is definitely, definitely fucking
killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows great outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if we loop back to your answer
before you mentioned, uh, the purple
[SPEAKER_04]: Dahlia among other things, and we had a
few questions about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess people must be sitting on packs
and they're sort of curious, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: what sort of things can they expect out of
it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's your thoughts on the purple
Dahlia overall?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like, I think like, like what
put people off is, you know, I put a
[SPEAKER_01]: warning on the pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: If something's like subject to her and do
something, I'm going to, I'm going to put
[SPEAKER_01]: that on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, you know, somebody can avoid
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got a lot of people, Oh,
I heard him like, well, yeah, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you, you know, if you,
if you do something fucked up and this one
[SPEAKER_01]: has a little bugaboo about this,
I just don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should, uh, you should be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and out of that honest deal,
I feel like none.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, Oh, you're like,
you can go buy this other shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, it's, they're going to
tell you that's going to hurt them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to tell you that I get
your, get your money or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's, it's, it's whatever,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: But out of the, out of the phenotypes,
um, there were just these, these blends,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and it's not like something
that's like, Oh, you got a bunch of packs
[SPEAKER_01]: for is, is multiple and.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every pack out of the females that
were incredibly, incredibly dark purple on
[SPEAKER_01]: this black screaming Eagle style frost on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just tasted like fucking great
candies, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fucking tastes awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the effect on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking divine, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, really liked that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was another, like another ever,
ever looked on or maybe looked at and
[SPEAKER_01]: just, you know, just, just starting to
decide and study because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I remember when I smelled,
uh, the jar of it at the cup a few years
[SPEAKER_04]: back, I think that was one of the ones I
was most impressed by.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having trouble remembering if it was
that or the sangria punch, but I think it
[SPEAKER_04]: was the purple Dahlia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purple Dahlia was definitely very
extremely dark purple and had like that
[SPEAKER_01]: Eagle type block, but purple, if that,
that made any sense at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple great B also had that, that
citrusy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incensey type type form blended in with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the sangria very, very frosty stuff,
but I mean, yeah, it's not spot on is
[SPEAKER_01]: sangria punch, like spot on and everybody
smelled it was like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's angry.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch was like, yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we get the name.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, if we move on, sadly,
since you've sort of been away on hiatus,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, there's sort of been a bit of a change
in the cannabis landscape and specifically
[SPEAKER_04]: we've, we've sadly had to bid farewell to
two friends of both the industry,
[SPEAKER_04]: but yourself as well, you know,
notably Monte sub cool and also bog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Josie Wales too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Josie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that also happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess my sort of question is,
how does it feel to come back and to see
[SPEAKER_04]: that the cannabis landscape has changed a
little bit, or do you feel like it
[SPEAKER_04]: actually hasn't that much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's weird because like to me,
it's kind of like the grow room thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in there every day, you don't
see a whole lot of change, but if you go
[SPEAKER_01]: in once a week or something like that,
you see a lot of, so for me and like
[SPEAKER_01]: totally, totally away from it and coming
back, I mean, it seems about the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: like honestly, but like that's just far as
like I made the Instagram goes,
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been to a show or anything like,
uh, now from what I've seen going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the shows are definitely,
um, going downhill, I guess, but I already
[SPEAKER_01]: saw that coming many, many years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That last one that was at you were at or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember when they pulled me,
they're like, yeah, you're not on that
[SPEAKER_01]: panel anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that you're like, yeah,
they want me to interview somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, you know, um, you know,
I saw it, you know, even coming before
[SPEAKER_01]: that point, but then once that,
that show out, I was like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I hate to see it a few
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have kind of vicariously,
you know, through others and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: showing their videos and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, it's just, you know,
other than that, I mean, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's basically the same, uh, as far as
like people passing away, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a project at that show, um,
cause me and Bob, we ended up,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, we shared a booth space or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll thought it was like real fucked
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like people were lined up and they
didn't even know who he was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, like, you know, get,
you think you see this man, you need,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to get stuff around.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like, uh, like I grew his shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I literally had space and time,
I would continue growing his shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like you really, you really need to,
you know, get this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up like kind of bending,
bending for him as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's overall, it's really,
really good dude too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I was like, look, man, like we need
to, we need to do something together,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, we came up with a good solid,
solid plan or like two things that would
[SPEAKER_01]: really drive together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be knocking socks off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get to it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, as time goes by,
it's like, all right, well, it's about
[SPEAKER_01]: that time, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That shit all went south for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally I died and I'm like, oh fuck,
you know, I didn't get a chance to say
[SPEAKER_01]: goodbye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like, probably one of the worst
things about when friends or people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or care about or think highly of
when they die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you don't, you don't get that chance
to say goodbye or anything else that you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to say to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and the same thing goes for,
you know, Josie, you know, Monty and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, um, you know, you wish you
maybe you'd said more, uh, when it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: time you had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just for everybody, you know,
so remember, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can happen at any time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, um, tomorrow's not
promised, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But cool thing is, uh, his son,
his son's keeping, keeping things kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: going and, uh, I'm going to get with him
and, you know, still, still going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: that, make that happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be awesome to still see
something happen because you have both
[SPEAKER_04]: junior and Pat still, still around and
need to be taken care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be a good honor, honor to honor
to the guy, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I probably should have asked this a
bit earlier, but I was curious to know,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you have any advice for people who
maybe not in your exact circumstance,
[SPEAKER_04]: but just sort of, you know, trying to get
everything back together, dust themselves
[SPEAKER_04]: off, get back on the horse, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you got any advice in that respect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, don't be hard headed and, or,
I mean, do be hard headed, I should say,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, refuse to stop, refuse to lose,
refuse to give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as your mistakes come across,
long as you're learning from them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, you're becoming stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're becoming better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, don't, don't give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just whatever is faulting you along
your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to sit back and look at it
outside, look at it and really analyze
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, when you, when you do succeed
and be the best thing ever, and you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: really refine yourself, you know,
and you've grown as a, as a human being as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just anything you want to start or do,
you know, just go all out and really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just go all out and don't focus
on money and fame and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the worst thing that, you know,
you're, you're getting into something for
[SPEAKER_01]: the wrong reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's the goal, I've seen people do
that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it doesn't, it doesn't work out
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if that's your thing, like go to
Hollywood and maybe try to be an actor or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, just whatever it is that you're
going after, um, if it's something you
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate about something you really
love, you know, really, really delve into
[SPEAKER_01]: that man and, um, follow that love,
follow that passion and do it for those
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the other things are going
to, are going to follow behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, and follow your six
P's, um, come up with a plan, plan your
[SPEAKER_01]: work, work your plan, follow your six P's.
[SPEAKER_01]: The proper planning prevents just poor
performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you stick to that, um,
and like I said, be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very adamant about not, not giving
up moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're going to succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And simple, simple as that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some brilliant advice there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that in, in your absence,
there had been some rumors surrounding
[SPEAKER_04]: Dominion Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think specifically some of the
things that I saw posted was that there
[SPEAKER_04]: was supposedly some seeds that didn't end
up with the vendors they were meant to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And others say they were sort of stolen.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bit unclear.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then other people had been involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that your wife had been dragged
into it at one point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think Skunk VA had been sort of
dragged into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you just be able to clarify a little
bit around what happened?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I think the toughest part about what
happened to you was that you didn't have
[SPEAKER_04]: the opportunity to discuss any of it
yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's all sort of secondhand
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you could maybe clarify some of
those things, it just helps set the record
[SPEAKER_04]: straight.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause man, this is like, you know,
there's nothing worse than, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you, when you can't even speak up for
yourself, you know, so essentially like
[SPEAKER_01]: what had happened was I had all this
planned out in case shit went south.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get a bond or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything was laid out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these are supposed to go to the
spender, the spender money's to be done
[SPEAKER_01]: like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's still, you know, making
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The projects were already ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds were ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything should have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice and smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, you know, I'm losing contact
with people and not being able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: ahold of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, literally none of this plan is
happening whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, at led to me, they can like,
huh, like, you know, what, what's going on
[SPEAKER_01]: here?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, cause if there's a problem,
you know, like I can fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can figure shit out even from,
from my position.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like I said, every, not everybody,
but some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ghosted out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had, you know, just call it an
employee apprentice or what, what have you
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, like see counting,
packing, making the vials and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: did a great job on all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also, you know, helping along with
watering later on, like in that last half
[SPEAKER_01]: year before all this is going on,
doing some water and doing some gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm relocating down south.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely needed the, definitely
needed the help with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and just kind of be the best teacher
that I can be, you know, and treating them
[SPEAKER_01]: like an apprentice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so they're supposed to be handling the
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they go, they go fucking ghost on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and everything is not being handled in
the way that handled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like all these like, you know,
rumors are like starting to come about,
[SPEAKER_01]: like people are telling me that I'm in
contact with and I'm like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is like a load of horse shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like one of the biggest ones that,
that fucking got me was I didn't do any of
[SPEAKER_01]: the growing or any of the breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh hell no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that one, that one was just the most
fucking ridiculous shit I had heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially like in a community,
like where people have like, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you personally, like you've literally been
there in person, like watching it,
[SPEAKER_01]: watching this go down and, uh,
like in there, you even claim that they
[SPEAKER_01]: did all the work for drum and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, like, I mean,
you can, you can speak up if you want,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I mean, you like literally
personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every, every day for two weeks,
I saw you doing the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did you see anybody else doing
anything?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just me and you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like people, could even like go to
Seoul and ask them and like, that dude
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like me for shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even he'll tell you, you know,
like, yeah, dude was, dude was fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: doing this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got Robbie from nerds genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was my neighbor there, like where I was
doing nothing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hang out over there every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had a lot of other, you know,
people that just like to come by and hang
[SPEAKER_01]: out while I'm working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a shit ton of work,
but you know, if you can hang out and I
[SPEAKER_01]: can talk while I work and people just
thought it was cool and fun, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they got to see me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, James means been there,
witnessing it, uh, like protein Jane was
[SPEAKER_01]: right around the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: She would come by and just hang out,
you know, you know, just learn stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a few other people, they're,
they're on IG and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like I said, they would just,
you know, come and hang out and shoot the
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a triple sticky lungs on IG,
an old friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was by there all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big thing for he was always over
there, you know, just, dude, just so many
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking people that were just like,
that is a load of shit, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a rumor is a rumor and a rumor doesn't
die till it's killed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another thing is like, yeah,
they're claiming to be a steady reader.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like, is anybody actually asking
them any, any questions about breathing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'll bet you, that's your dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't, they're not going to have the
answer to it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cause they weren't, they weren't ones
doing the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, yeah, so obviously like
this is, this is not, not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, this is the source of,
you know, what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like some people, um, uh, won't even
throw his name out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, even though I probably should,
but I'm not, um, like buys into a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one, like, and he told me,
cause like, I needed to talk to him
[SPEAKER_01]: recently and he's like bought into the
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, yeah, you lied about,
uh, going to go into prison.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only thing to lie about anyway,
but whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So luckily I got like some paperwork
nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got like my original, you know,
date and everything else will snap a
[SPEAKER_01]: picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, all right, yeah, that's this
2007, you know, explains a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, once again, you know,
I have old friends that used to literally
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to me, you know, over the phone at,
at this, at this facility, they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they, you know, helped me out through
money on my books back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all, they all knew what was up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and, and the worst thing is,
is a person that's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading this lie, um, saw me like right
when I got out of prison and like was even
[SPEAKER_01]: around like with me going to the probation
office to take my piss test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they, they know all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, they're just obviously just
trying to come up with so much bullshit
[SPEAKER_01]: just to, you know, accomplish their own
goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, I guess at the time,
you know, sell the remaining of the stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they said, we're going to start
up a new company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, by all means, like, you want to
do your thing, like do your thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: like start your company, like good for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the wine and all that extra shit,
like you didn't need to fucking do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another one who was like,
Oh yeah, you're on nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only seen that shit one time in my
life and I wasn't doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even got in a fight with the guy like
two days later on the job site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he's a fucking piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't fucking do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody that really knows, like I don't do
drugs and there's even been cases of
[SPEAKER_01]: people that do drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I straight up, I tell them like,
I can't, I can't hang around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's just, you know, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and you know what I say to that,
anybody that knows me could tell you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but anybody wants to say some shit like
that, go down in your fucking pocket,
[SPEAKER_01]: pay for a fucking paraphilical test for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, put you, put your money where
your fucking cock holster is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fucking get that test.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go back, I think like seven years
or so I've been gone too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that gives you a good five fucking
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I was on any type of drug,
it'd be on there and I'm gonna come up hot
[SPEAKER_01]: as fuck for THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I can squash out when right
fucking there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, having this paperwork and
shit like that to be like, Nope,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where you fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you weren't here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't have done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the check stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I got like literally like
this, this through every single fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, some of it was so fucking
absurd that people in the know,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are out there, like they obviously
know like bullshit because they were
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking there, you know, so very,
very, you know, very disheartening,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to see all that, you know,
especially after somebody that you really
[SPEAKER_01]: looked out for, you know, so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, you know, they,
you know, I felt some kind of way we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do what they were going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's whatever, like, you know,
you don't fucking, you know, ruin me,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm going to keep doing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep moving forward,
but you know, they're not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: around for it, which is, you know,
bad, bad for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the worst part is like good friends
that you're really trying to take care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ultimately when I was like,
yeah, no fucking cash, cash the fuck out
[SPEAKER_01]: and then spread a bunch of lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have somebody to help me cash out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the worst part is like the good friend
that actually like believes this shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and was very adamant about,
oh no, you're lying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're lying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should just stop lying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your life back together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, like literally I can literally
prove all this right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just what, what I have at my,
at my hands length right now, like a piece
[SPEAKER_01]: of paperwork was fucking dates on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I get to the house, I got my whole
fucking PSR.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can read the whole fucking thing,
like everything in detail, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Discredit the fuck out of it, but why in
the fuck are you going to believe some
[SPEAKER_01]: wild ass crazy shit like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm somebody you don't even really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over, over your friends in some years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what is more mind blowing,
you know, and hurtful, I guess than
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like, you know, I can
definitely, definitely squash out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, any, any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, like I said, it's just,
you know, like you were saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just, you, you, you're one of the
people that's actually been there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, seeing those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it comes off as just pretty,
pretty absurd anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, you hit all the questions I was
going to follow up with before I even had
[SPEAKER_04]: a chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for painting, you know,
a clearer picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that you've always got to take
stories you hear with a grain of salt when
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't have the ability to hear all
perspectives.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that must've been a really
frustrating aspect for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not being able to reply throughout this
whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, that's what they count on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was saying, that's what people
like that count on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you always hear the saying is
like, people are going to kick you when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And furthermore, like being down is like
you're muffled, you're silenced,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're physically actually
restrained, like you can't do a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when people see things and then
they come out with it and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, something's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, then you got people bickering
and fighting amongst each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is, you know, fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then cause one side's gonna pick one
or the other and it gets fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then unfortunately, you know,
you get other people drawn into the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they get really pissed and
frustrated with the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, it's just a whole cancerous
thing and it grows and grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not able to like really get
out there and stop it, it just gets worse
[SPEAKER_01]: until, you know, time and we'll iron
everything out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without you even having to, you know,
step forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously like I've looked back and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like a lot of good people
out there knew the shit was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're screenshot and they're recording,
they're doing all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, I was well informed,
like right when I, right when I got back
[SPEAKER_01]: and put it all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, you know, it, it irons itself out
really, especially when you got stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so absurd.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just comes off weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, obviously it's like,
yeah, it's obviously, uh, obviously a lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, but now being able to
actually deal with it and talk with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, it wasn't really that widespread or
that big of a deal for real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but still just the fact that somebody
that close was trying some shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what bothered me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like if anybody did hear anything
like, yeah, it's just, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: most everybody anyways, like, yeah,
that's, that's a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's cool too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know, you know, you got,
people in your corner that know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, you know, a solid dude and that
you're doing what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is, you know, the good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live a good, good life and you're
going to do that, you don't really have
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing to worry about when people do,
you know, talk out the side of it and
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, and now that I'm back and
they would have kind of ironed that out
[SPEAKER_01]: and be like, yeah, you know, straight up,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got, you got hoodwinked, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by the end of it, man,
like, yeah, now I kind of see what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to, you know,
get it, get it very apparent to them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just so they know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, that, that should,
that should kill that right where it
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking my eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, hopefully that can help set the
record straight for anyone who maybe had
[SPEAKER_04]: heard some of the incorrect rumors
circulating around.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think, you know, on the other end of
the spectrum, there was what I thought at
[SPEAKER_04]: least was some good things that sort of
came out regarding like community banding
[SPEAKER_04]: together in that there was at least what I
know of two breeders who were very keen to
[SPEAKER_04]: try to help you out financially.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, good old Odie of heroes of the
farms, as well as, um, soul fire genetics,
[SPEAKER_04]: both came to the table and wanted to offer
some strains to help raise some funds for
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was this something you had any idea was
happening or was it sort of a pleasant
[SPEAKER_04]: surprise when you found out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, I won't even say pleasant surprise,
like just static.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just blown away, um, by all the people
that came to bat for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I had friends telling me,
they're like, you're getting hit up from
[SPEAKER_01]: people all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people are just like, you know,
whatever, whatever they can do,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever help that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they all have a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's this one time this dude took
two hours to, you know, on a DM to teach
[SPEAKER_01]: me a new, a new approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I gave him an address and I sent
him, you know, a whole lot, the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking menu is still in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, or somebody that was down and
out and I donated to the fundraiser or
[SPEAKER_01]: wildfire fundraisers are just,
you know, not, I don't, I don't do things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that because I'm thinking like,
Oh, well, and, and, you know, it might get
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it just to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I had done so much of it,
you know, it didn't really cross my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they're, you know,
I'm hearing back from them like,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, yeah, I guess, I guess I was getting,
I was getting out there, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and all these people just came out
the woodwork, came to bat for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't, I can't thank them enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, only thing I can say is,
yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all helped me make it through like
seemingly like the impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And only thing I can say is, you know,
I've promised to do a, do some more good
[SPEAKER_01]: in this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do a good job and I won't,
I won't need those services anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will not be going back to the old pen
ever again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for everything that you've
done from kind words to donations to just
[SPEAKER_01]: anything and everything that's truly,
you know, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a, what a brilliant sentiment there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it makes me curious.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to know, is there any chance we may
see any collaborations in the future now
[SPEAKER_04]: that you've, you know, you've got,
I mean, you, you already knew before
[SPEAKER_04]: people liked you, but now you really know
that for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, is there any chance you want to
maybe do Co-Labs or you more just
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking, you know, I've got to get myself
going first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, man, gotta put others before
yourself, especially on stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm working, been working
basically the day after I got out of
[SPEAKER_01]: already done on it, like stink on shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, y'all definitely look forward to
a whole lot of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a little bit of a selfish segue on
my part because, you know, the,
[SPEAKER_04]: the hoodoo has been such a, such a popular
strain, really cool Co-Lab between you and
[SPEAKER_04]: SkunkVA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any sort of breeders who,
since getting out, you're interested in,
[SPEAKER_04]: or more importantly, since, you know,
you've gotten back out, are there any,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking about, are there any
strains that have caught your eyes in
[SPEAKER_04]: like, Oh, that wasn't really a thing when
I went away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, and I was thinking about it and I
was like, I don't know if anything major
[SPEAKER_04]: has hit the scene since you left.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only things that I've seen that
really, really, you know, like caught my
[SPEAKER_01]: eye or attention that I'm like,
Oh yeah, yeah, I'm gonna need to get on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all worked for me, you know,
like my buddies, um, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only said his real name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably no big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but, uh, Bob Hemphill, um,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been doing some great shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like my type of style too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, yeah, he doesn't need to beat
some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and my buddy AKB brings for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's been doing some really cool shit
and all his, uh, his crew of dudes,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, do a lot of work, but like Williams
Wonder and F5 of that and some,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you know, work and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm, yeah, I'm, I'm all about that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, that's, that's, that's got me,
got me actually pretty, pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably more excited than I should be,
but pretty stoked for both those dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I love them guys, but,
uh, yeah, they, they got my interest peak,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot of stuff, some of the
stuff SkunkBA come out with was pretty,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty rad looking too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, not, not really a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really a lot of changes, a lot of
dessert stuff and kind of the same things
[SPEAKER_01]: that were hitting when I was away,
you know, they're still doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was sort of the vibe I got,
but you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You, you mentioned both those two breeders
because I was going to ask you questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, you know, have you
seen Bob Hemphill's park back cross?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's looking pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that fucking popular park
Lebanese dude today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That, that plant is a special plant for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was curious to know though, uh,
this is actually a fan submitted question
[SPEAKER_04]: and they've, they've got a good memory.
[SPEAKER_04]: They basically said that they remembered,
uh, some time ago you'd mentioned that
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd lost your Durban tie high flyer and
they were wondering the cut you had,
[SPEAKER_04]: was that different to the one that AK
Beanbrains and SkunkBA use or is it the
[SPEAKER_04]: same one and you just like hadn't got it
back off them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure about AK Beanbrains one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think so, but I'm not a hundred
percent sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I gave the, uh, the high flyer to
SkunkBA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that that's the right one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I got another buddy that's got
it, got it backed up for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my buddy got Savage Gardens up in,
uh, up in Portland.
[SPEAKER_01]: He even did a little hybrid using it
called the Thai Ice Tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like super, super popular up there
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That struck my eye too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some fucking gnarly shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got some cool BWiz hybrids he's made.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still follow his stuff ever since
meeting him at Emerald Cup that year.
[SPEAKER_04]: He does nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess what I'm interested in asking is,
do you have any reservations about the
[SPEAKER_04]: authenticity of the Durban tie high flyer?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I remember when I spoke to,
um, Bodhi, he actually said to me that he
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't speaking for certain or anything,
but he said that over the years there had
[SPEAKER_04]: been people who had come out of the
woodworks with Durban tie high flyer
[SPEAKER_04]: clones and often he was skeptical of the
authenticity and he sort of said that he
[SPEAKER_04]: suspected it was maybe like a Durban tie
leaning, um, hybrid of the Durban tie C99,
[SPEAKER_04]: because that was sort of a more recent
release, more accessible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever thought maybe that's the
case?
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, this isn't anyone speaking
about the specific clone in question.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a general sort of question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say like, well, as far as like
that exact thing before I made that DTC
[SPEAKER_01]: 99, like the re-release, you know,
using just the regular Durban,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, we had that, that cutting like far
beyond that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wouldn't be for that unless it was
the older DTC 99 from what, 2001,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, when they, when they
did that, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I highly doubt it because that,
that would be a rare gem on its own and it
[SPEAKER_01]: would probably be, um, called and named as
such.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of, kind of doubt that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also when Saul was, you know,
smoking it, you know, when I, when I had
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten it, um, he was like, yeah,
that's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's, that's what he
remembered, um, as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, it's pretty,
pretty spot on to me and just kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: way it grows and kind of a little
different influences from just a straight
[SPEAKER_01]: Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but the thing is at the end of the
day, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be safe for him or anybody that
gets phones from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you really know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you really know what went on in
Holland?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you really know that their tie was
authentic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you really know this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you really know that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's a, that's a great thing
to say, because there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: uncertainty and what, what is,
what isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I've, you know, I won't say it,
but there's been a lot of breeders to go
[SPEAKER_01]: on and get something and breed the fuck
out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then years later, you know,
I've heard them told year after year be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, yeah, well, that wasn't really this,
I guess it turns out it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you gotta, gotta be,
be wary for sure, you know, and you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, always try to stick to,
you know, authentic, authentic sources and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes people's authentic sources
turn out to be, uh, be all fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it comes out later, you know,
and I've seen, uh, you know, I won't put
[SPEAKER_01]: the name out there, but, you know,
um, I've seen it happen, happen to you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, we just got to do our
best and, um, you know, just take,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, take with what we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, if everything points
to, yeah, this is legit and cool and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can, uh, you can move
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I just try to deal with,
you know, straight up people and people I
[SPEAKER_01]: really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it makes sense,
you know, especially if they got,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, this is how it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was where I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, uh, you know, um, that's definitely
a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's so many people out there
that have this or that is just so many,
[SPEAKER_01]: so many red flags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you're talking about that
dude earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, fucking old cornbread mafia
roadkill skunk clone, uh, right here when
[SPEAKER_01]: we go change the game and you're looking
at this picture and it says fucking plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has got a leadings on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was literally just the seedling
and he's talking like this 30 year old
[SPEAKER_01]: plant taking pictures of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you can literally see the
kind of leads on the, uh, on the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you, you got a lot of,
a lot of bullshit people out there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's definitely,
it's definitely a tricky, tricky situation
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah, so as, as best as I can
say, yeah, yeah, that's a legit one.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I feel you for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I'm definitely going to go back
in post-production and like audio effect
[SPEAKER_04]: his name out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one, which one was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I say?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we'll, we'll, we'll take off,
uh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, fuck that
[SPEAKER_04]: motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so it's, it's sort of
interesting that you mentioned many of
[SPEAKER_04]: those things, uh, that, you know,
talking about when you get clones,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, do you really know what they
are?
[SPEAKER_04]: Things like that sort of vibe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess it segues well into the next
question, which was that although it was
[SPEAKER_04]: around before you went away, I think it's
really come to the climax in the past 12
[SPEAKER_04]: months, but the hop latent viroid is what
I've been calling recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's the COVID of the cannabis
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's, it's really, really
spreading around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any concerns around your
plants having it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And would you ever look into any sort of
like tissue culturing to try to get rid of
[SPEAKER_04]: it if so?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would definitely want to test
everything, um, first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really would like to, uh,
just tissue culture the whole,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, for backup purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, if anything's gone astray since I've
been home, it would be nice, it'd be nice
[SPEAKER_01]: just to start cleaning the spray from
scratch, you know, plus, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the added bigger and all that stuff that
goes on as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be, uh, I feel like a good,
good way to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I guess it's probably too
early for you to really give definitive
[SPEAKER_04]: answers, but are you going to be much more
apprehensive and skeptical taking in
[SPEAKER_04]: clones moving forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always sketchy as shit, but I was a
real sketchy kid anyhow, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's the number one thing where
people thought that they just take in
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever they don't quarantine and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, Hey, I guess now that COVID isn't
going on, everybody's doing quarantines on
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like the same with those
plants, you know, keep them out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: population and keep them locked down,
you know, keep a tight eye on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just, you know, just throw it up
into the mix and ruin your shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know you've spoken about it on
the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you, if you feel like there isn't
anything really more to add, I certainly
[SPEAKER_04]: understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we had a lot of people ask about if
you have any new tips or trips for sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: your IPM, or is it still largely sort of
what you used to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's generally the same, you know,
kind of what always was anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just going right back to what people
said, um, just, just the basics are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep people away from even having to
really get into any problem fixing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, don't take in strange shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let this dirty ass people up in your
grub and help it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let anybody in your grub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just the basic keep it simple,
um, process, you know, just be clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let the animals run around the yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so many things that just make your
life easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your IPM, broad mites, russet mites,
um, phytomites, um, pythium and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: other, the more, the more common things
that people are dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just all starts with good clean
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not taking anything, uh,
that you don't know about those,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially without proper learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just keep it basic and follow these
basic principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll find you don't have to,
uh, you don't really have to deal with a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole lot of them and concentrating on
this growing, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's, that's really it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to resist the urge to bring in
the, uh, the new silver gelato runs and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and keep the, keep the around safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a question that was both submitted by
fans and me personally, I was interested
[SPEAKER_04]: to hear about, unfortunately, um,
you ended up going away sort of not too
[SPEAKER_04]: long after one of the releases from
Dominion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess people didn't really find
out as much about the figure four crosses
[SPEAKER_04]: as maybe they were hoping.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I was wondering, could you give us
any sort of description slash details of
[SPEAKER_04]: the figure four and what you were hoping
to bring to the table with that mail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a shame because I didn't really get
to speak on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was tested and ready and packed
up and went out, but it was literally
[SPEAKER_01]: right at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I go deal with this right quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, they lied about that bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, I didn't get that chance to
come back out and talk more in depth about
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but you, you actually, if I'm not
mistaken, got the witness, at least one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the steps, um, that was in, in making the
mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you remember the ass man airborne
skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, that was the boy that ended
up getting developed and then hitting the
[SPEAKER_01]: triangle and the whole, the whole process
of selecting the final mail out of that
[SPEAKER_01]: hive was to hit OG type plants,
stem type plants, fixed structure and
[SPEAKER_01]: still, still not take too much away from
what was there originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, have you, did you get to see any
like the Savage?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I saw them, but I saw the,
the ass man and the pollination from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big beefy, big beefy mother fuckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really like the main things that I
wanted to really get into outside of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, of course the, the funk man,
the terpenes and the potency and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to take away from a lot of that,
that internautal spacing and I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: make the branching a lot stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, that was the, the main,
the main goal with that and just,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just live them up and just
reinvigorate them and get some shit that
[SPEAKER_01]: was coming out extra, extra, extra stank,
but also extra, extra strong, higher
[SPEAKER_01]: yielding and everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's a brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, we had another listener who was
wondering, you know, they say,
[SPEAKER_04]: look, I see Doug's work with a variety of
different OG cushions over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just wondering, what do you
prefer personally?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like writing that question and I,
they, they'd been like, does he like
[SPEAKER_04]: headband, ghost, triangle?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, it's just triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as like, cause like,
I never considered like headband being an
[SPEAKER_01]: OG, you know, but you know, if he did,
then yeah, headband and CK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And out of a personal curiosity,
I remember a while back, you, you toyed
[SPEAKER_04]: around with the blissful wizard,
just as a, like a freebie slash a little,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, mark around sort of project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the cutting of cookies that you
think is the one you would most breed with
[SPEAKER_04]: if you were going to, or it's not
necessarily your favorite cut of cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really killer weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ain't going to lie, that is some killer
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, it veggies slower than
blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and like yield wise, you know,
but in it, and like I said, cookies has
[SPEAKER_01]: never really been my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, when I did that, I just,
uh, you know, Savage, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: he, he was the one that wanted me to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just making some means for him and
he's like, yeah, dude, so it's cool or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we made some for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, just give away this,
you know, just to be a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just a, just a thing,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a customer who had grown out the
funky town freebie and they were like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just would love to know what are the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought you might do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go into the genetics, then people
start trying to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just better just leaving,
leaving that part out and just stay,
[SPEAKER_01]: just enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's something that could
have been, could have been sold for a hot
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the whole point was to do it
away and, uh, but people enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I, can I take one stab at one of the
parents?
[SPEAKER_04]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why I have no idea why,
but for some reason, I just always
[SPEAKER_04]: remembered you did that urban slice,
like slice and urban slice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for some reason I just, my heart's
telling me maybe that's maybe that's in
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful, beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I know it's like, just most of them
were better versions of Tangy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I only tried one or two slice
Finos, but they were, they were great,
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, that was a,
that was a real good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the, one of the projects
that got left on hold, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I have to have to pick up when I get
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was like, yeah, let me put some,
some dominion type orange out into the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, before it leaves my mind,
you know, you, you mentioned Ars Man a
[SPEAKER_04]: while ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will we ever see that pop up in another
form or it would just be through the
[SPEAKER_04]: figure four?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, through the figure four, but we did
something super cool and I did it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it for Beanbrains cause he hooked me
up with that MTF, you know, just to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: out and shit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I decided it'd be a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It asked me and we got really,
really, really good on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so I hit it and I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sent him a huge, huge bag of seed
and, uh, I was like, Hey, what do you want
[SPEAKER_01]: me to do with them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, do whatever, man, grow them,
breed them, you know, uh, sell them,
[SPEAKER_01]: do breed them, then sell them to whatever
you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just my way of saying thank you
for, you know, passing something really
[SPEAKER_01]: special and old in me to grow and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and he did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess, um, I guess probably by the
time this comes out, it'll probably have
[SPEAKER_01]: already, already have happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: He, uh, being the good dude that he is,
is like bagging them up, sending them to
[SPEAKER_01]: James Bean and we're going to,
we're going to put them, put them out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you know, to hook you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, man, you're too much,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The MTF cross with the ass, man,
fucking Christmas tree, fucking bugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: some like orange citrusy crazy shit going
on and just put your dick in the dirt type
[SPEAKER_01]: potency on the, on the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavy narcotic.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, as you, as you start under hole,
as you started saying that I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I forgot to mention AK bean brains
earlier because he had mentioned to me
[SPEAKER_04]: that he was going to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, Oh, he, he donated some
strains as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's really cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dig that a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you got me thinking, I think there was
someone else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not important, but, um,
yeah, kudos to AK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bean brains are a really lovely guy who's
always been very lovely and helpful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, now let's go back to what we were
talking about just a moment ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were sort of in the realms of skunk
and you know, the slice has got that skunk
[SPEAKER_04]: in it, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are wondering,
do you still have, you know, original
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk seeds available to you or are you
working with the hybrids now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I still have, uh, seeds from the last
time I did a filial on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had done so much work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, hybridizing them and working
them in different ways, seeing what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening, what's not happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I wouldn't, I wouldn't go back to the
starting point unless it's a whole,
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole another, another project that I
found myself into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I don't, I don't really have much
of that on my, on my mind at the moment,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I would use something I've
hybridized it in to go forward in a
[SPEAKER_01]: project.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I was going to go, go that
direction, you know, um, now like what the
[SPEAKER_01]: slice for instance, you know, it was like,
uh, what was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like Cali, oh, it was just a weird
number one, you know, type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what like my curiosity fell with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, if I hit it with more scum on
like what, what happened, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was, it was pretty, pretty fucking
awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've, you've sort of got me
interested.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, what are your thoughts on the
reincarnated version of super sativa seed
[SPEAKER_04]: club that's popped its head out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've paid much attention
to it or even got a particular opinion on
[SPEAKER_04]: it, but I'd be curious to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it went, it happened right after,
or I mean, excuse me, right before I went
[SPEAKER_01]: in and it had happened a couple of times
prior to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people found out it was just like
a fake or it's scam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I heard it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never, I never got to really look
back into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of just kind of like,
you just reminded me about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to look at it like it's legit,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, look, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's hard to say, but I guess the,
the, if I sort of wanted to give you the
[SPEAKER_04]: dot points and have you reflect on those,
I would say number one, there's no strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're currently selling now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the former ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: What they're selling now are new strains
and there's only one or two that I can see
[SPEAKER_04]: that, uh, of older lineage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess with those dot points in mind,
I'm sort of a little bit skeptical and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and likewise, it hasn't made any waves
since releasing those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, uh, I would, uh, I could see
where that would happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like the thing that I saw like before
I went out, which kind of was just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: of why I just kind of didn't really think
about it much was like when I saw it and
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody went into it, they had like a
cookie hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, there was nothing at
all from, from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so yeah, I mean, that's,
that'd be, that'd be my thoughts,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a little, a little odd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, fuck you got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say back to AK bean brains.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I mean, just going back to home
and some other other folks that he hangs
[SPEAKER_01]: around, like it, even they got old stocks
that they're working with and bring him
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how are you the main, the main
company?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so that would, you know,
cause like, that's what people would
[SPEAKER_01]: ideally want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, not to say they wouldn't want
anything new, but, you know, you would
[SPEAKER_01]: like to think you'd see some of the older,
at least some of the old hybridized,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the new or, you know, some all new
creation something, you know, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm probably good on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was surprised when I saw the cookie
hybrids and stuff, but I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, well, but you know, the other thing I
was thinking about is all of the notable
[SPEAKER_04]: SSC, sorry, SSC strains were ones that
were pretty confident.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they weren't breeding in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, like the, the skunk comes
from Virginia and Williams wonder from
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's like, they weren't the
breeders anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the thing is like,
they were like a, a distribution company
[SPEAKER_01]: and like, even like in a sole work form
for a while as like one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: distributors, you know, like he would
mail, you know, mail the packs out
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the, the company was like,
it was like a collection of breeders from
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the place that all put their,
put their works under, under that line,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a, like a record label or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what made them really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what I felt it was like,
cause you got such diversity in so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different people, styles based that made
that awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, like that, that was a cool,
cool thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's like it, so it's not
surprising, you know, um, why those guys
[SPEAKER_01]: probably like, no, I think I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just holding on to my shirt or they're
just not giving a fuck anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, sort of in that same vein,
I'm not sure if you've seen, but Todd
[SPEAKER_04]: McCormick is selling what looks to
realistically be like real deal Northern
[SPEAKER_04]: lights and including the predecessors
because he's been able to strike up a
[SPEAKER_04]: relationship with the guy who seems quite
legitimately verified as, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know, I know, uh, Greg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess I'm interested to know,
does that sort of peak your curiosity at
[SPEAKER_04]: all, given it does seem to be some
reasonable proof that it could be legit or
[SPEAKER_04]: not so much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is especially like when it's,
you know, like I got, I don't know him
[SPEAKER_01]: like personally or anything, but,
you know, he's a standup dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: has a good reputation of being a standup
dude and standup people deal with the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, that, you know,
his reputation precedes him, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you know, Greg, you know,
like that, that's, that's legit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that, that tells me like,
you know, Hey, for me, like that's a go
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I would get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I was just curious, like
particularly because he's also selling
[SPEAKER_04]: like skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, Ooh, I wonder if that had
caught your eye either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't, I haven't got really,
it's been so busy just answering all the
[SPEAKER_01]: names I'm answering ones from always two
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, um, but yeah, just catching up with
people and working on like some of our new
[SPEAKER_01]: projects like the slow wire and other,
other little things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's been taken up a lot of time plus
doing the whole song and dance of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, man, I'll definitely,
definitely have to take a look at it all,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I, I, you know, I sort of feel bad
as a, as I hear you say that, because I,
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand where you're coming from.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're probably, probably still figuring
out what way is up and down.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have time to do that sort of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the more lighthearted questions we
got was, uh, how much did you miss
[SPEAKER_04]: barbecue?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much like just all food,
food, just human food in general is
[SPEAKER_01]: greatly greatly, you know, so,
uh, yeah, food in general, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we have barbecue, especially at least
definitely a big one on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very barbecue deficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had another person who was
wondering, they sort of were hoping to get
[SPEAKER_04]: some clarification on what exactly skunk
you were using.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that maybe what they're
referring to is like, maybe sometimes it
[SPEAKER_04]: said basic skunk, sometimes it said skunk
and are they the same thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think if you look online,
something says basic skunk is like NL five
[SPEAKER_04]: skunk or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, just hoping to get some
clarification around like, what was it
[SPEAKER_04]: that you were toying with exactly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like if, if it was, you know,
skunk one, it was, you know, noted as
[SPEAKER_01]: noted as skunk one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just old PVC pub stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got filial, uh, filially in red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, over the course of years, it was just
maintained and under whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the basic side, yeah,
it was like an L skunk and L skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a Shiva skunk, uh, you know,
you know, your Shiva skunk is a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a, that was a hybrid of
totally, totally different, different
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: More endocrine influence, you know,
uh, and more, a little bit heavier on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, on the narcotic, you know,
excited thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look in that same vein, we'd received
about three questions from people who were
[SPEAKER_04]: just curious about specifically one of the
parents in the local H the cuttlefish hash
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were just wondering if you could give
us any information on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's even I myself looked around very
little info about it online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like when we had this back in the days
before the big, you know, legal weed world
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that really blown up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of a tight, tight little
cut being held, you know, back then,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, really, really, really strong shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's funky nose on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, nice fat, fat fucking buds,
strong branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it, you know, it's, it was hard and
hard to beat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and unfortunately, like that's not
enough, not in my possession anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so that the other closest thing
I have, I mean, relations is the one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, I don't know anybody that's
got any more than one dude that hooked it
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's, he's, he's dead now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I really couldn't tell you that'd
be surprised ever, ever see it again,
[SPEAKER_01]: but who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls somebody's holding on to it out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, like the local H it feels like
that embodies some of the characteristics
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have to imagine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came out a lot, a lot on the smell and
the effect, you know, um, and then having
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that sour diesel in the next two,
you just, you know, really, really brought
[SPEAKER_01]: all these good points together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you, you smoke local and it's pure,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you can kind of know what I'm,
what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So funky ass for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even the local hybrids I've tried are
all killer, like consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, definitely just as a good breeder too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, just non finicky plant first
date.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got about everything that you want in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is like a no brainer to,
uh, you know, toy around with it a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, let's see what happens,
you know, and then the hybrid winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So someone had a question about the shine
apple and it's interesting because I'd
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of noticed some of these things they
raised myself, but they said, say what
[SPEAKER_04]: percentage approximately of the shine
apple phenos have like that leaf mutation
[SPEAKER_04]: where it's like just, you know,
one or a couple of leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And specifically the reason why they were
asking is because this person likes,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, those sort of mutant plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're just wondering what's their
chances, how many packs would they need to
[SPEAKER_04]: buy to be sort of reasonably certain they
might come across one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a freak in every pack,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that was definitely a freaky one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was, it was that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you approach that commercially
as a breeder where you're like,
[SPEAKER_04]: look, this killer seed line, but there's
some people who just might not like,
[SPEAKER_04]: they might just think, oh, it's a run.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, and you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're sort of preemptively doing things
without realizing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have to consider that or it's just
irrelevant to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what, you know, whatever people
who are going to do, uh, and ultimately,
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately they're going to do,
uh, if they see freaks or rods or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: and they decide to call it, it's like,
that's generally a, a, it's always been a
[SPEAKER_01]: bad move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like most of the best plants I've ever
grown were a little bit slower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a little bit freakish, you know,
I always figured like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that were a little slower is like,
they were taking their energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got that energy in the plant that it's
going to be producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously it's not biomass and fast
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I'm thinking, ah, it's going to be
later on in flower and, uh, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's always super.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I was wondering, have you ever seen
any other cuttings where like,
[SPEAKER_04]: when you do a certain combination and you
equally get these weird mutants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I used to always notice, uh,
when I was growing a lot of bogs work,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would get a lot of petty old buds,
you know, like, well, weird things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was certain other things I've
grown, like where I get like the flat,
[SPEAKER_01]: the flat stem, you know, that's like,
you know, not rounded black, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: weird leaf mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shit like that, you know, I've always
kind of encountered it fairly,
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly regularly, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and even like when you start growing
out larger, larger numbers and shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll see a lot of little odd,
odd little things, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have to make like your own duck's
foot out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long term, long term.
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're on the topic of cultivation,
I want to quickly get this one out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Earlier on, you mentioned with the purple
Dahlia that, um, you know, you put the
[SPEAKER_04]: warning on the pack saying, you know,
this can, can hurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was reading about it and you sort of
saying, you know, if you feed humic acid
[SPEAKER_04]: with these G 13 hash plant hybrids,
like it can just sometimes happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess the question is, yeah,
like how long did it take you to figure
[SPEAKER_04]: that out?
[SPEAKER_04]: That seems like it would have taken me
like a lifetime to be like, it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: humic.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not, not long, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, when, when testing,
you know, as you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I would try to put things through
the ringer, like go on purpose,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and there were other things that
I would, I would do where I'm like not
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding at all, you know, just plain
water, just to see what, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: are you still going to get the results of
the straight up water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when, when doing that,
the ones that were getting a feed with
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, with the humic and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain ones would pop up like,
Hey, what, what are you, what are you
[SPEAKER_01]: doing there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, one with the, one of the
plain plain water wasn't, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm like, all right, it's like the
feeding thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me, uh, let me back off on,
on a lot of things, you know, and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that this went just straight up dragonfly
that flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think I just made like a back
one or two, some earthworm capsules and
[SPEAKER_01]: then it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I doubt it's just our water,
or, you know, anything else that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that might've, might've been hit with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what about the humic?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I reintroduced humic and,
and boom, then it happened again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not every single, you know,
you know, but certain ones that it
[SPEAKER_01]: happened, like that when you do,
it doesn't, when you don't, don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: that told me like, Hey, you know,
you know, humics, uh, humics doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just guessing what the,
the, the more uptake of, uh, phosphorus at
[SPEAKER_01]: that time, it just didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it just wasn't, wasn't digging
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's actually, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you're able to sort of systematically
figure it out like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because, you know, I don't feed much,
you know, it was pretty, pretty simple,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty simple approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a whole, whole lot of things
to really diagnose, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that, that actually simplifies it
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we've just got a few fan submitted
questions before we get into the final
[SPEAKER_04]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new thing, man, that you're doing
fan submitted questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have that before.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got one from our buddy, True
Cannibalist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he says, what's your favorite chem dog
cutting?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's, if you had to give just one
definitive answer, what strain do you
[SPEAKER_04]: think was the bud that the first chem
seeds came from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So second one threw me off because I don't
know what I'm going to say, but what was
[SPEAKER_01]: the first question?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your favorite chem cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, chem cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: 91, 91 hands down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, that was, I think for me,
I think that's the best one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the chem, where do I think it came
from as far as like just the mom or both
[SPEAKER_01]: parents?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you, yeah, just the female,
what was the actual bud that the seed came
[SPEAKER_04]: out of?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put my dollar on Skelly
Hashman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the next question, what's your
overall all time favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the fucked up question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's so impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that is such an impossible
because it depends on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the time of day and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even answer that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's just, that's hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of, all right, how about I make it a
bit easier for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the final questions we normally ask
is if I'm going to drop you off on an
[SPEAKER_04]: island and you can take three strains with
you for the rest of your life,
[SPEAKER_04]: they can either be clones or you can just
take a pack of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a real bastard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say Local H, Screaming Eagle
and 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got, you got a lot of different bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, but yeah, that, that, that would,
I think that would be good to go there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And would you take just your clones or
would you take a pack of seeds of each?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was taking a voodoo, definitely a
pack, Screaming Eagle would take a pack of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds just because you're on a desert
island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I don't know what you got
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're something to do, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, then if it was like 91 and
local, it would just be the, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next one, this is an interesting
one that I've sort of been wondering a bit
[SPEAKER_04]: myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any idea what's causing more
and more weed to have those tiny little
[SPEAKER_04]: premature seeds in the calyxes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me and my boy pig farmer, we had this
talk back in like, it was like 2016 even,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we call them like micro beans,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I just really went with, cause it
wasn't, every genetic, you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a certain thing and we,
we were really, you know, like it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we, are we pushing too hard?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what is, or is it the actual thing
that we are feeding, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got the, got the thinking about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I came to, it was like,
look, you grow your clone your way on the
[SPEAKER_01]: regimen that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was on like, a very strict regimen,
you know, he's, he's a, he was a real
[SPEAKER_01]: producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that dude, my God, they pump some
fucking blood out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm the highest, highest quality,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I take the same stuff and I'm growing
it, growing it on my own, doing it totally
[SPEAKER_01]: on my way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was doing it, I wasn't,
I wasn't getting up and he still was same
[SPEAKER_01]: type of lighting, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The same, same environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we could, we could scratch,
scratch that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, it was something to do with the
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I feel like if it's not a very
particular ingredient in a nutrient that
[SPEAKER_01]: was in their line, that wasn't,
you know, something I was doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: or it just came from just pushing too
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the weird thing was you wouldn't
see any bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't see any herm, but yet these
little bastards would would pop up from
[SPEAKER_01]: something somewhere, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and like I said, they never developed
from tiny little micro leans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one, still to this day,
that one would kind of elude me,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's something, something to do with
either an ingredient that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: certain people have in a regimen that
they're feeding or pushing hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're, if you're that person and
you know, you're not pushing hard,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, look at, look at what you are
feeding and then just try to start pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: things out, you know, one at a time until
you figure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you figure it out, then you
save a lot of people, a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: trouble, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't actually thought of that,
but that's, that's a pretty reasonable
[SPEAKER_04]: explanation, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another question we got, which is actually
something I would love to know the answer
[SPEAKER_04]: to is what is your preferred way to
collect pollen, ideally to sort of store?
[SPEAKER_01]: So storing pollen is kind of, kind of,
kind of tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long-term, I guess, you know, like when I
think storing, I'm thinking like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're putting it away for a later date
and time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main key to it is when you're sifting
it out, like you really got to sift that
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: There cannot be any, any plant material at
all, preferably in a low humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that would be a bonus because
the, your main enemy is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture at the end of the day,
but it's going to sterilize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure that you got no plant
material in it because of course that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant tears and I have moisture in it and
you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then keep it away from moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're putting it away and I'll
make sure that it's not, not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: incur any, any moisture there either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very well sealed up to where you're not
rapidly changing temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause one thing I noticed with the bite,
put some weight in everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brings it right out of the freezer,
sets it down on the table and he's just
[SPEAKER_01]: got it, got it in this little Rubbermaid
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He cuts out from the food saver bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sits there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what happens when you get real cold
coming into a warm, warm area,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get condensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fucking kills it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, my little tip of the day and huh,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just realized it'd be a play on words.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tip of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Q-tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's your Q-tip of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, collect pollen on Q-tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and this is like, you know,
for the small batch, like you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: making shit at home just to see what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for making a fuck on OC of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just taking it and getting two Q-tips
and getting them all in nice and covered
[SPEAKER_01]: in pollen and put them in bags,
seal them up and then put them away for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for a later time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could take those out and pollinate,
you know, just single buds, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to get, you know, 50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so you can, you can do that
for the hobbyists, um, for the guys who
[SPEAKER_01]: are making a shit tons of seed and y'all
are big boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Y'all can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to do it in the past myself with
flour and that that is not a good method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that either man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like I don't like to add anything to
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the flour like sterilizes it and
is maybe even hydroscopic in itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, this is one that like,
it's almost redundant, but I feel like we
[SPEAKER_04]: have to ask at this point, do you think
that we're ever going to get like a
[SPEAKER_04]: roadkill skunk that comes out to the
community or do you think we're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: recreate it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think it's just maybe not
entirely what we remember?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think, I think that a lot of times
people will have some, some really skunky
[SPEAKER_01]: weed and like, I hate the word or the
roadkill skunk, you know, um, this from
[SPEAKER_01]: all the shit that goes on with it from
that, especially that one guy anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I think a lot of people don't
really hit the genetic potential on a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of their growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, certain plants are more forgiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the terpenoid range, like,
you know, Durban's and cookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack Harris, and a lot of things,
it just doesn't matter at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smell always comes out and there's a
lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really got to nail it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not going to see a whole lot of
that outside of organic that are done like
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really primo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a lot of times people get the
stuff and they, they don't hit the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, they don't hit the marks and they,
they add it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just didn't quite get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do believe that, yeah, somebody,
somebody could definitely put it out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you know, and work it, take,
you know, years of work and put it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed form and, you know, have everybody
ran brave, try to rip it off and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, act like fucking assholes about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, that, that's going to
take a special type of person who wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: do all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that ain't going to be me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, I mean, it's, it's there,
it's there to be worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, somebody,
somebody is going to have to put in the
[SPEAKER_01]: work to do it and decide what they're
going to do at the end of the journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're going to put it out there,
just hang onto it and be happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of, kind of preserved,
you know, but there's just so many things
[SPEAKER_01]: that could be, you know, skunky weed,
you know, it doesn't have to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's not a pure skunk variety or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of, you know, Afghan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hybrids, Ashland hybrids and all types
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can give them the desired effect at
the end of the day, but then ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be up to the grower to,
you know, do their thing and grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause back when you lost skunky weed,
you know, people grew up a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: differently too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, I think there's a lot of
input that people don't, don't use
[SPEAKER_01]: nowadays that we're being, being used back
then and people miss out on a lot of that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's an interesting take.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely think that the style in which
we grow now versus then has something to
[SPEAKER_04]: do with it for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that brings us onto the final quick
fire questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to have to word this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have to think a little bit
about how I word it, but basically I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: wondering if there were theoretically
people in jail who did smoke weed,
[SPEAKER_04]: was there a particular experience that
people thought was quite memorable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of, I got a story of my other
friend and a legend friend who might've
[SPEAKER_01]: allegedly done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instantly he's like, Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, by the way, they pissed us
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just, you know, like it can get hit
randomly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, you piss 30, like it's a very bad
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the time he's like, Hey man,
Hey, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think I'm all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, dude, you're fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, like they're, they're going
to know it's like, Oh man, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is like within an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, should I just drink a bunch of
water?
[SPEAKER_01]: What should I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just total fucking paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this goes on for weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, you think I'm okay by now,
like I'm, you know, I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not really fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty effy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you think they're going to call me?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I enjoyed fucking with him every
fucking day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I passed on the, on the opportunity
allegedly, if that ever happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and for, for that reason,
because I know that that would be just
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the worst fucking day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on the same token, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you would instantly regret it on the
exhale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would not be enjoyable at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope, uh, your friend was, it was all
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allegedly he was, he was fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next question is what's the one
cutting you miss the most?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like currently in this, in this
moment, if I had one, just rock it out
[SPEAKER_01]: real quick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, like just overall something you had
at some point in the past, it just isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: around anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, man, I missed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuddlefish was a pretty big, pretty big
hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were already talking about it
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, yeah, that's, that's
definitely, definitely that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a, uh, I had a female,
um, out of a sour IBL, um, from back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the day that was like way better than the
original, original, uh, sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I missed that one a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good one to pick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good one to pick.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next question is, is there a
question that you wish you could ask one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the other breeders out there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Alive or dead.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would probably, if I had the,
if I had to pick one, I'll pick somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: who's no longer with us because if they're
alive, still still got that chance,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there's a lot of dudes,
you know, alive and still like just take
[SPEAKER_01]: it with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, talk to like, I know Shani
Bala was always one of, I always kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to kind of just pick his,
pick his brain a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's a few, but probably have to go
for another one to sit down with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have a lot of, a lot of questions too,
cause he got to see so many things growing
[SPEAKER_01]: on such a large scale back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it'd be, you know, asking about all
types of little, little traits,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that, that he was picking up on
in these large populations that let him,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to do what he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they were, they were truly starting
from very, very wacky beginnings,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to see the work that he ended up with
at the, at the end, that was me or at
[SPEAKER_01]: least fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys were really fucking doing it,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be one, not one probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd probably have to likewise do the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second last question.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the most, most disappointing weed
experience you ever had?
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe it's like something that was
really hyped and just fell short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a dangerous question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there have been so many, um,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think I could pick just,
just want, I'm thinking like things that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown personally, but, um,
I'd probably say like, you've been with
[SPEAKER_01]: me, you've been with me at the shows
before.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you remember people like this bring
you, bring your random buds and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was a lot of fucked up blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would come our way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've taken the side and I'm like,
yeah, don't feed Kelvin off of the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're fucking yourself up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then later we come back and be like,
wow, I made all the different worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and sometimes see stuff with powdery
mildew on it and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I guess, man, I don't even want to
say, I guess it'd be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just hate her, you know, because it
wasn't even the real.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like back in the day, like I got turned
on to like the smoke, some cookies that
[SPEAKER_01]: was like the real, the real legit cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was, that was pretty good,
but it was like some of the all shoots or
[SPEAKER_01]: the knockoffs was like, wow, this is just,
you just get kind of like a little buzz
[SPEAKER_01]: for a few minutes and it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, tastes good, but it's just
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's substance to it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not, not doing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like when you hear the person that
this guy is talking, just raving about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and you're just like,
ah, I don't know, man, that real one was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of, kind of, I don't know
what's up, you know, but, um, I was let
[SPEAKER_01]: down by a lot of the, by the hybrids and
shit like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, certainly not a sentiment new to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've heard that before, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a few elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stood out like really good, like exotic
Mike had that cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, there were like a few that
stood out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, wow, that's actually good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, a lot of them, man,
they're just like, yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everyone's grown out of cookie
hybrid before, and usually you find some
[SPEAKER_04]: weird mutant in there that just totally
fails.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, okay, okay, we're done
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so our final question for this one,
if you had to pick one genetic or strain,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's just going to be erased from
existence and all the prodigy from it are
[SPEAKER_04]: gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one you're going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm going to, I'm going to answer this
and everybody's like, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't secure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm going to take out beasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take out the fucking
beasters, the top 44 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't call it the Viking that fucking
and the beasters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That needs to be striking stricken from,
uh, from existence for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a, that was a bad, heavy,
non-resonating shitty buds that got slung
[SPEAKER_01]: for way too much money across college
campuses and had he boys, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, yeah, fuck the beasters,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're coming from the record.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: A humanitarian at heart doing something
for the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be put with Lex Luthor in that
fucking plate glass thing or no,
[SPEAKER_01]: the dude, some Superman or when I put them
in the glass, they sent them in outer
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when the beasters needs to go with
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that just about brings us to
the end for this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Were there any comments or shout outs you
wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, um, just to everybody that,
you know, supported before during and

pipe, um, onwards and upwards.

when you mentioned one person,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start going down the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you fucking slip, forget that one
person thing, they're going to be fucked
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to go down that route.
