about their upcoming drop, some plans for
[SPEAKER_00]: the future, and some thoughts on the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further delay, let's give them
a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, Gang, we're back for another
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this episode, I'm grateful to be
joined in person by the dynamic duo behind
[SPEAKER_00]: the exotic Turb Powerhouse that is Umami

[SPEAKER_00]: A huge welcome to both Umami and Harry for
joining us today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, G.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate you having us on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again so much for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you smoking on today?
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, right now, we're getting into some of
these new flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, I'm most excited about the...
Well, I don't know, Harry, what do you
[SPEAKER_04]: like most?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I like out of these whole batch,
I like the Samurai Tears.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think the Samurai Tears.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the most potent of all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the Cold Heat by Swish.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's got Runts, it's got Triangle F2,
and then we cross that to our kind of Hash
[SPEAKER_03]: Plant Fino.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of our washer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, it's strong, but really tasty,
so.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to bring gas back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we've had a lot of fruity
flavors, a lot of funky flavors,
[SPEAKER_04]: and now kind of want to go back into some
of the OGs, some of the cushions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the brushes, some of the cams,
you know, create interesting mixes between
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of the new fruit flavors and some of
the old funk and find something,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, just keep it interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the old school meets the new school
sort of approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed on your Instagram you had a few
label tags of some different strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there are a few different OGs in the
mix there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given you just mentioned that,
what's your favorite OG cut?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, favorite OG?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably the lupus headband, right,
the underdog, right, the diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was one of the first ones that I grew
by myself that absolutely smashed,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was like really proud to show people
that bag, you know, because like OG was
[SPEAKER_04]: always tricky to grow, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a homie who lives up in Chatsworth
who taught us how to grow SFV,
[SPEAKER_04]: and like at that time we were feeding,
I mean we fed it fucking Cool Bloom and
[SPEAKER_04]: Cow Mag, you know, like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing but cow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing but cow, I mean the thing just ate
Cow Mag, and that was the secret,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember like Loom, I was like talking
to someone, and like Loompa like overheard
[SPEAKER_04]: me talking about Cow Mag, and he was like,
bro, don't give out the fucking secrets,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like that's the magic,
that's how we crush OGs, because everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: else would grow OG and they'd yield
nothing, you know, pound to light,
[SPEAKER_04]: pound and a half, these thin little twiggy
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was still fire, but you couldn't get to
like pack on weight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the first time we started pulling
like two pounds of light, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, 2.2 with, you know, straight OG
cuts, like that was, that was one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: really excited about it, but the headband,
Skywalker, TK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hardcore.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hardcore, which I mean now I'm
actually, I hadn't grown the hardcore
[SPEAKER_04]: until recently, I just got, I like went
and got all of my OG cuts back and a bunch
[SPEAKER_04]: of other stuff, so I can like rework some
of the flavors, but that hardcore,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean it doesn't look like all the
classic OGs, it's definitely a bag seed or
[SPEAKER_04]: a hybrid or something, but that one has,
out of all the OGs, it has the most unique
[SPEAKER_04]: twist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a lot of them are really,
they taste almost identical, they look
[SPEAKER_04]: almost identical, you can see the little
subtle differences, but that one is like,
[SPEAKER_04]: she's quite different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I noticed it's had like a bit of a
resurgence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to remember, I think it's Nasha
is a breeder who I'd seen do some hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: with the hardcore and it got me interested
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think you'll do any seed releases
using the hardcore going forward?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as the crosses come out fine,
fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the only problem I've watched
hardcore in the past, which now that like
[SPEAKER_04]: solvent extract has kind of gone where
it's gone, I'm really trying to focus on
[SPEAKER_04]: products that will grow, like genetics
that will grow well in flower form and
[SPEAKER_04]: then also will wash well, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the right type of resin and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hardcore, I remember we washed it,
it got like less than 1%, didn't melt,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it was tough and I definitely
wasn't as good at making hash back then as
[SPEAKER_04]: I am now, like we didn't know anywhere
near what we do now, but you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's definitely going to be some work to
get something that's going to melt in a
[SPEAKER_04]: high enough rate where, because it might
be a cross of hardcore and then find a
[SPEAKER_04]: dopefino and then cross that again with
something else, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's got, at least carries the flavor,
but then will give us, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the yields that we want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I mean, nowadays people are upset if
it doesn't yield like 4%, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: 5% in the bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then press at 80 plus percent,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market has certainly dictated some
certain minimums around, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: returns and what's going to make it
worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of curiosity, I'm sure we're going to
delve down the rabbit hole of concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: and extracts quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to start off, what's your,
what's your favorite type of extract?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are you like a dry sieve guy,
bubble hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'll probably get some flack for
it, but like BHC show, applesauce.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Straight up.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I love rosin.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love rosin, but you know, pour one out
for all the mono terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They get lost in the water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you don't get the exact same profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, like some people would argue
that that's better because some of those
[SPEAKER_04]: mono terpenes are, you know, they're not
as good or they're this or they're that,
[SPEAKER_04]: but like nothing captures the absolute
essence.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a butane propane blend, super cold,
cold cured.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I always hated diamonds and sauce
because especially back before we were
[SPEAKER_04]: using like cold hot tech on nails,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where if you hit like a hot dab of like
rocks and Terps, the Terps melt off the
[SPEAKER_04]: THCA first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are supposed to be dabbed at the
lowest temperature, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's exactly opposite, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, you know, the flavor profile
gets totally screwed, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: blend that up and make some applesauce
like all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of like sort of,
I don't know, mantras that exist in the
[SPEAKER_00]: States that don't escape it outside of the
US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess like, you know,
yeah, there are a lot of people who don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like BHO here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a lot of people who don't like
Jack Herra here and train wreck and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that and blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet in the rest of the world, we haven't
been so fortunate to have that exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm still like, man, fuck,
give me that Jack Herra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me that BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the best dabs I've ever had were
BHO for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really interesting to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask because you guys do breed
for extracts and for Terps specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: just as a general recommendation,
I always like to ask breeders this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't give you any information about
the buyer, because I know the answer is
[SPEAKER_00]: you want it, you're going to want to know
more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to ask if you can recommend one
strain out of your catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess by implication, I'm sort of
saying, like, what do you just think is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good all rounder?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you recommend to someone if you
don't know anything about their grow
[SPEAKER_00]: style, but you're just like most people
would be pretty happy at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_04]: For like a recent release, foam probably,
you know, foam smashes, it yields well,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's frosty, it's purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll do really well in a wash,
both solvent and non solvent stacks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy to grow, you know, like in terms
of just like grabbing some seeds and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, being able to throw down round
one without really having to tweak
[SPEAKER_04]: anything too hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, she's just a fucking monster.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the phenos are just big and blocky and
crush.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they all wash well because swish,
the pheno that I reversed, that one washes
[SPEAKER_04]: at like four and a half, almost five
percent, which I picked that plant because
[SPEAKER_04]: it's super iced out, purple, hella PM
resistant, squatty, quick, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: flowering time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one is done.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 60 days, like done.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go longer, but there's absolutely
no point.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get no higher yield, the flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultimately, a lot of the flavors like
start to mute out and change the longer
[SPEAKER_04]: you run them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bro, you pull Skittles a day 53.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people even like that's when you get
the candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the longer you go, the gassier it
gets.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll get the bag appeal goes through the
roof.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once you go like 70 days on Skittles,
it'll be purple like it totally changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the turps are just gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the I mean, it doesn't last long.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the time you've cured it, that flavor
just starts to disappear every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no like, oh, I've got the
Skittles and curing for like three months.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, no, like it's you want it to look
like lawn clippings.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like straight up because it's
getting rolled up or it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's turned into hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you're not looking at it while you
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flavor over everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole ethos is flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I get lost or I'm like trying to
figure out what we want to cross or where
[SPEAKER_04]: are we going to go next?
[SPEAKER_04]: Flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about anything else.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll delve into some sort of related
questions a bit after.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to loop back quickly to the
foam recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of terpene profiles would people
sort of be thinking they might get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_04]: So foam is I mean, I described foam as
like vanilla strips or like a stripper
[SPEAKER_04]: perfume terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say stripper, you mean like like
a solvent sort of?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean like a strip club.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that like Britney Spears,
vanilla, like really trashy fucking cheap
[SPEAKER_04]: perfume.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like just if you walk by, you know,
I've never been in a strip club.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wink, wink.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like if you walk by and you can kind
of imagine like what that smell mixed with
[SPEAKER_04]: like some sweat and like just kind of some
grungy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also got like a little bit like the
soap is more like cushy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the soap definitely doesn't really
smell that much like soap, but it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit more like, I don't know,
it just helps round out the sweetness and
[SPEAKER_04]: like kind of the upper notes that are more
like perfumey because any flavor that's
[SPEAKER_04]: like two one dimensional, like,
you know, for example, I'm not a huge fan
[SPEAKER_04]: of Jack or some of those hazes because
it's just straight terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I can smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, like that it's two one
dimensional.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be able to smell multiple
things, taste multiple things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You hit it at different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can kind of change the flavor a little
bit like it's a little more interactive,
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an interesting trend that I've only
just sorted to pay more attention to is
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've seen and heard a lot about in
recent competitions that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: submitting like blends of extracts because
it's trying to achieve what you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, that more complex profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of different sort of facets to the
overall terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think this is a trend we'll see
continuing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard of this yourself?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely, which we started doing
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we'd always done it with like BHO,
especially because we never had,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like back in the trap days or
early in the trap days, we didn't have any
[SPEAKER_04]: anything, one flavor in bulk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that you always wanted to have a
mixture of stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So usually in order to like do any sort of
sizable run, it would have to be a mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem with a lot of those is like
you lose, you know, it's not like the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole is greater than the sum of the parts
in this case.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's usually just like, this is kind of
like a little, a few notes from this or a
[SPEAKER_04]: few notes from that, but it doesn't work
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes like that GMO papaya,
that filthy papaya blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when you start to blend,
especially like, I don't know what it is
[SPEAKER_04]: with solvent extracts, but like the non
solvent extracts is where the mixes start
[SPEAKER_04]: to shine, which we would see, especially
when I was making water hash in bulk back
[SPEAKER_04]: in the day, some phenols wouldn't wash as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you took a phenol that washed well
and mixed it with something that like
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't, you could actually start to make
that wash like viable, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: To spend the time and energy flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, you get like an
interesting mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you have a bunch of like sift
or like, you know, water hash that's dry,
[SPEAKER_04]: ready to get pressed, mixing those in
different ratios and kind of like finding
[SPEAKER_04]: what ratios work really well, you can,
you know, you have a whole new menu of
[SPEAKER_04]: flavors that are cool, which would
otherwise take you, I mean, a breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: project for me takes like well over a
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like I could take these two things and
press them three or four times over the
[SPEAKER_04]: course of an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we can taste all those flavors
and find out what's a cool mix and what
[SPEAKER_04]: ratios work well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we could spend a year and a half trying
to create that flavor like naturally.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think it brings in a lot of
creativity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you can kind of like invent
your own flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you never tell anybody the exact
ratio of what you're doing, now you have
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of a proprietary recipe to make a
cool flavor, especially if you're making
[SPEAKER_04]: it with like two in-house cuts that no one
else has, you know, kind of set yourself
[SPEAKER_04]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of people are having a focal
discussion at the moment around how people
[SPEAKER_00]: who have been in the game for a while,
maybe we'll call them legacy farmers who
[SPEAKER_00]: are feeling like they're being pushed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can reinvigorate their brand and stay
relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does sound like an interesting way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that it's possible that that
someone could pursue that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think you'd need to be a bit
more inventive than just that and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: come up with a few different ways to sort
of stay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say relevant, but to keep
your niche from the bigger companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think there's so many different
avenues for people in the space that
[SPEAKER_04]: there's no limits, you know, the only
thing that matters is if people like what
[SPEAKER_04]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if, you know, if you can create an
angle and enough people like you,
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't get to decide.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't get to decide any of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The market decides everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we make, what we release,
what's popular, what cracks off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's not up to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, it's up to me to kind of
read the room and try and figure out my
[SPEAKER_04]: best guess as to what people are going to
be excited about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can help guide them one way or
another, but ultimately we make no
[SPEAKER_04]: decisions, you know, we're absolutely the
mercy of what people want when,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I just try to supply my best version
of that, I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's plenty of room for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, and if we take that premise in
the other direction with the advent of
[SPEAKER_00]: blends, the first thing I started thinking
about is that surely one day we'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: like a Jack Daniel's equivalent where it's
like this company that can buy bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: distillate or whatever it is, bulk
material, blend it to consistently put out
[SPEAKER_00]: this mass produced sort of product that's
like, you know, on the palette or the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect it's sort of consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's a foreseeable future
or do you think there's too much variation
[SPEAKER_00]: in the cannabinoids to ever really be able
to put out something super consistent on
[SPEAKER_00]: that level of production?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think the consistency will be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's plenty of people that
want that and seek that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like people like, let people
like stuff, you know, like they like Coors
[SPEAKER_04]: Light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have Coors Light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's also plenty of like
bougie, more exclusive, different flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, if that, if that speaks to
them or not, like they have the freedom to
[SPEAKER_04]: choose and, you know, try what they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if people want that, then like,
great, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, fills their, fills their needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But usually those people, that's your
step.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like most of those people shouldn't say
most, but there's a good enough percentage
[SPEAKER_04]: of those people where that's a stepping
stone for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they start to wonder what else is
out there, what's different, what's
[SPEAKER_04]: unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they start to come in,
you know, like basically, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: they mature as a consumer, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they're like their flavor
profile, like that they like starts to
[SPEAKER_04]: change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they start to open up into
what's, what else is there, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: What other flavors might, might I find?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, me and plenty of other
breeders are, you know, sitting there
[SPEAKER_04]: going, come on, like, we'll show you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of flavors, like every
flavor you ever thought possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a beautiful segue you've
given me because I was going to ask you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you were talking about flavors and in the
question before you were saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when I'm not sure what to do,
I just, I revert back to flavor because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, that's my whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What flavor are you chasing next?
[SPEAKER_00]: What don't we have that you would like to
make if possible?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to find flavors that I cannot
describe with words.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that I've never tasted before.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like the goal of every breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, the goal of breeding project is
one, the crop hybrid has to be better than
[SPEAKER_04]: both parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, what's the point?
[SPEAKER_04]: And ideally I'm trying to mix and match
flavors that are going to create and
[SPEAKER_04]: generate something unique and different
that can help set me apart where,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, people try that and they go,
it's not like, oh, that's cushy or that's,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that's got, that's some Skittles
or that's got this or that's got like,
[SPEAKER_04]: no, I don't know, like what the fuck was
that?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never smelled that smell before.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not words that I know how to
describe that smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I'm after.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the whole like umami, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet, sour, salty, savory umami.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's not, it can't be described with
any of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that sort of, you know, it's
intangible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the blend of flavors create something
new and unique and different that you
[SPEAKER_04]: can't, you know, you can only describe as
like, that's, it's almost a feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, truly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, what's interesting is
like, um, research shows that feelings
[SPEAKER_00]: actually start as a physical sensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't feel anxious and then get
tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel that you're tight and then you're
like, oh shit, I'm feeling anxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's exactly what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's a physical stimulus that
then causes you to feel away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me a little bit about what
inspired the genesis of umami.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it that caused you to think,
you know, I want to start this company?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started growing in 2006.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always knew that I wanted to have a seed
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything like an early on in the cannabis
game, like it was either you were growing
[SPEAKER_04]: or you were making hash or you were making
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, wouldn't it be cool to do,
to start from seeds and make your own
[SPEAKER_04]: product and make your own strains and then
make your own hash, create something new
[SPEAKER_04]: and different and just having something to
call, call your own.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plan was always to make a seed
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really there wasn't, you know,
I hadn't had enough time in the game to
[SPEAKER_04]: really start and put my name on something
and be proud of what it could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I wasn't good enough at growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly wasn't, you know, good at
breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was, you know, I've still not really
considered myself a breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we make seeds, we hunt seeds,
we do the job.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the whole point was find something
cool and unique and different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I gamed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I finally had the skills to the point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had the library, you know, I'd collected
seeds for a decade, you know, before that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the timing was right to start the
company and launch.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me, let's go back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to do it in reverse order
to what we normally do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then tell me your first cross you ever
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that intentional?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it an accident?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what were the genetics involved?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was intentional.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was there was a family vacation in
Mexico and then somehow seeds ended up in
[SPEAKER_04]: Salt Lake City, Utah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we popped those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We grew them in my homie's backyard.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you spend that much time growing
the plants and then you have a male and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're like, well, I mean, I'm not going
to kill off the male.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, come on, you know, it's I spent so
much time and energy to get this thing to
[SPEAKER_04]: this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was just some like open pollination,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was I mean, I was hooked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking the first second those plants
popped out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I knew I knew what I was going
to be doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was some Mexican, you know,
sativa, something or other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that the first grow you ever did as
well?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so let's fast forward a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you got more serious about growing,
what was the first thing you started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing like, say, under a light?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first ones we were growing under a
light were.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Parijuana was one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a blue cheese.
[SPEAKER_04]: By Cali Brains, there was a let's see what
else we were doing back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was this one my buddy gave me called
a Hyperion, which was some some hazy,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Indica hybrid or something that
was it smelled and tasted kind of like
[SPEAKER_04]: coconut.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funky, like in the hash tasted very
much like coconut, which was unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never stumbled upon anything even
remotely similar to it ever, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: since then.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so there's there's still some flavors
that I'm looking for that I remember,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I like to think I remember every
single bag I ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good memory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I just, you know, I remember what the
flower looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember the flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely remember a lot of them that I
grew that sucked, you know, that were just
[SPEAKER_04]: no dice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, it's like, what did I do
wrong?
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, now looking back,
it's like hilariously apparent,
[SPEAKER_04]: like just how fucking terrible,
you know, I was a cultivation early on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, we just didn't know enough back
then.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's a lot of like bro science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so you learn in the ropes and you're
starting to refine your craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there any breeders or specific
growers you sort of looked up to in those
[SPEAKER_00]: early days and were taking advice from?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I always liked so like Greenhouse
Seed Co dropped their like land race,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, videos that they had,
right, where they'd go to the bush and
[SPEAKER_04]: hunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like I was DMing Franco like way
back when.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was always super cool and friendly
and like, you know, I'd ask him questions
[SPEAKER_04]: and like he was, which he had no need to
do any of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, wow, I'm just some fuck off random
dude on Instagram, like sending DMs,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, asking for advice or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was always really cool and really
friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, definitely Franco from
Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Mr. Nice was, you know,
like it was a lot of like the OG Dutch
[SPEAKER_04]: dudes, you know, who were like going hard,
especially because like early on,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, some of the things I started
seeing was Mr. Nice out in Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_04]: right, running the old pillow play.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had just the biggest cultivations
you'd ever seen at the time where you're
[SPEAKER_04]: like, where on earth can you possibly do
this?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is at a scale that is just
mind boggling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was always really cool to see,
see some of those dudes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always thought I'd end up somewhere
in Europe, you know, building a company
[SPEAKER_04]: because I was like, well, I don't see this
happening in the States, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the California dudes left,
you know, the DNA guys were out there
[SPEAKER_04]: because, you know, they weren't really
doing it in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then luckily for me, you know,
the rules in California started to shift
[SPEAKER_04]: where now we could actually get like,
I mean, it wasn't a license by any means,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we were covered under medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the 99 plant recs and, you know,
we were in counties where we could grow,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, at scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was kind of the first time we
started running like big, well,
[SPEAKER_04]: not big, but bigger operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after you had started the company,
what was the first sort of project that
[SPEAKER_00]: you felt really helped establish your
identity within the public eyes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where even you yourself are like,
man, we're like, we're really doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my homies in Arizona, they own a
company called Grow Science, which is a
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty big cultivation outfit out in
Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they bought a bunch of my seeds for my
very first drop ever, which went,
[SPEAKER_04]: the first drop went pretty well,
you know, all things considered.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a brand new breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like I had no, you know,
there was really no legacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like leverage any of my other
companies or brands because I wanted the
[SPEAKER_04]: thing to stand on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the mail or what was like the
project?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a, the mail was Mac Mints.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I crossed that to pretty much
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a Thinman Co.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cookie crossed with a Mac mail that I got.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then I crossed that with, you know,
the whole menu.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Grow Science had the Frodo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember Cap posted a thing and this was
like back when they were doing drops of
[SPEAKER_04]: like piece of grain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, Hey, there's,
you know, I'm doing a Thin Mint drop of
[SPEAKER_04]: flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go, you know, go scoop the flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also like some seeds in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, you know, a whole bunch of eights
were purchased and then ground up to find
[SPEAKER_04]: like six or seven seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hunted those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I found the mail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that was kind of what kickstarted
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it was a frosted ass thick,
just big, giant, meaty monster mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, this is the one we start with,
you know, hit up Cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, is it cool if we breed with
this?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yeah, you found it in the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, that was, we went,
we went to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I guess it's fairly safe to
say probably no one else really has a mail
[SPEAKER_00]: from that particular cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, certainly not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of curiosity, how many eights did you
buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a ton or just like a couple?
[SPEAKER_04]: 20 or 30 eights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of them didn't even have one seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we found like six seeds total.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good marketing from Cap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, it worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: It worked out well.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I like, I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, I found that and then I
made F2s and like, I never released any of
[SPEAKER_04]: the Mac Mint stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only, only crosses, but they were,
they were fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we did the Lime Soufflé,
which was a Mac Mint female.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's smashed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one washes really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that female like in terms of like
turbine profile and effect?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, I always described the Mac
Mint's as like gelato.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like heavy on the gelato,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very similar to gelato because it's
got the fitment cookie and it's got Mac.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's got Starfighter in it,
but it's, so it's pretty hashy,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's definitely got this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I always described it as like
solventee, but like the type, the exact
[SPEAKER_04]: type of solvent is like rubber cement.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, if you, you know, I don't know if
they still use that in school,
[SPEAKER_04]: but way back when, you know, you just like
crack open that jar of rubber cement and
[SPEAKER_04]: you just get hit with this noxious fumes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was what I got.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got like chocolate and that super,
super, that stringent chemi like sour,
[SPEAKER_04]: like yeah, solvent funk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was, that was the, that was the
turbine profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where did you go from there next?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did we do after?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did the Mac Mint drop and we did the
Key Lime.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I did, then I went to Femmes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did the Key Limeade, which is the
Sunset Sherb crossed to the Burning Bush
[SPEAKER_04]: cut of Key Lime Pie.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was a quick flowering,
purple, super creamy, kind of soapy,
[SPEAKER_04]: a little Skittles-esque.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that Femme run I hit to, I don't know,
I think that menu was like 10 or 12
[SPEAKER_04]: strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that stuff still sought after,
like people all the time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 710 Labs runs a bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 710 has a couple of those like on the
menu.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean a lot, like that was one of the
first big Femme runs that went,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, really, really well,
especially because here in the States,
[SPEAKER_04]: like people don't like regs, at least like
they could tolerate regs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reg seeds back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, like probably sell like 10
or 20 to one Femmes to regs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I really wanted to like go back and
focus on Femmes seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although when stuff is, when you find a
really amazing male, it's just like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can't do it at the disservice of
never, you know, making any seeds with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I found Zucchi and like Cantucci
and some of the other ones, it was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, obviously I'm going to do,
we'll sprinkle drops of these in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to touch on that specifically
because I know that you do, as you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, do both regular and Femmes
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find yourself gravitating more
towards one than the other just on a
[SPEAKER_00]: personal level?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow-up, do you think there's
merit to some of the age-old criticisms of
[SPEAKER_00]: Femmes seeds you hear?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of the anti-feminized seed
crowd is either just parroting a lot of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, this narrative that they've
heard in the past that's not really rooted
[SPEAKER_04]: in science.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, to some degree,
I think if you constantly, if you go,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Femme, Femme, Femme,
Femme, Femme, Femme down the line,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see how it would make sense that the
genetics could shift maybe in a way that's
[SPEAKER_04]: not like ideal, because that is about as
far from the natural order as you can get.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me as a breeder, I'm always going
to do like, I usually, I'll never cross
[SPEAKER_04]: two whatevers and just do the seed line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the, the pollen donor is something
that I've made and worked like,
[SPEAKER_04]: or found, like, you know, something unique
to me, period.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm never going to take like something
that comes from a Femme line and then
[SPEAKER_04]: Femme that again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'll cross- Yeah, take a clone only
and then Femme it and then get it to
[SPEAKER_03]: another clone only.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to inject a male in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and I've got a couple of males that
I like, that I work with, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that I've worked with for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know exactly what they're going to
do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like a good male, I mean, one of my
buddies always says a good male is
[SPEAKER_04]: literally priceless because, you know,
I know, I know what kind of phenos we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to find.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what the progeny is going to look
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we'll hit that to, you know,
something that's cool, find it female in
[SPEAKER_04]: that generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that can get reversed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, I'm not doing Femme on Femme on
Femme on Femme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, we had a, an auto breeder on the show
recently, flying lion research.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a cool dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in his turps as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, he said this analogy about orders,
but it sort of applies to what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says it's like a zipper light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sort of unzip it and then zip it back
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you Femme stuff, you sort of
closing it and zipping it up and hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: something else to it is like unzipping it
and opening it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sort of have been thinking about
that analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask because it's a,
you may not have too much thoughts on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we do talk about it from time to time
on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of some, some people still have some
question marks around the lineage of
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles, you know, it's still,
there's, there's obviously that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Grape Ape, Grapefruit sort of
thing that you hear, but then there's
[SPEAKER_00]: still like a strong amount of people who
believe that it's like maybe a Sherbet S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Fireloss test said it was a
Sherbet S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's like, I've never really been
able to get my head around that because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's sort of, my gut instinct is like,
it doesn't seem like a Sherbet S1 to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then you've got guys like Inspector
from CSI Humboldt, who just does like
[SPEAKER_00]: these big hundred seed phenohunts of like
Sherbet S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he reckons he finds plants similar to
Skittles in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on the lineage of
Skittles?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the Tur profile is very similar,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're, they're at the very least in the
same neighborhood, if not on the same
[SPEAKER_04]: street, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The structure, wildly different,
wildly different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown, I've grown both.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have both.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown a lot of Sherbet hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've grown a lot of Skittles hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've not seen as much crossover as I would
have thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the structure is so different and
like everything you cross Skittles to,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can almost immediately identify whether
or not it has Skittles in it because of
[SPEAKER_04]: the leaf structure, because of the stack,
the stem structure, like it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: it sticks out like a sore thumb,
at least, you know, to my eye.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with Sherbet crosses, I don't see that
as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, could they be related?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they?
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what are the actual genetics?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who the fuck knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things we'll, we'll probably never
actually find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we're talking about Skittles,
I noticed on the website, you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: array of interesting mothers, many of them
incorporating skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me wondering, what's your process
like of acquiring mothers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have like, if I had to guess,
I'd say you must have these like vast
[SPEAKER_00]: networks where you can get new and
emerging clones or have I got something
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your process?
[SPEAKER_00]: You seem like you got new stuff all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, there is a there's a vast
network, you know, like minded people who
[SPEAKER_04]: are always chasing like the newest
flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I've been fortunate enough
to be in space for long enough to have,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, friendships with, you know,
a lot of legacy dudes who a lot of them
[SPEAKER_04]: are like just as excited about getting
them to me as I am about getting them
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're like, hey, I got this new
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: With it, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, a lot of those genetics,
like I luckily I don't have to go looking
[SPEAKER_04]: for them so much as like they find me,
which also helps me to know, like,
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, this is clearly something people are
interested in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this might be worth a look.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what sort of things impress you about
a plant in terms of if you're thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about maybe breeding with it, is it mostly
about like the flavor profile and
[SPEAKER_00]: structure presented in front of you or do
you want to breed with it a few times and
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of see how it breeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are your considerations in
general?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the number one thing is flavor,
as always.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all the any new cuts that show up,
they get run, you know, at least once or
[SPEAKER_04]: twice to kind of pre vet whether or not
this is something I'm even interested in,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, goofing around with,
because some of them, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: they have a bunch of hype somehow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I grow them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, no, like for whatever reason,
you know, and it might not necessarily be
[SPEAKER_04]: because sometimes the flavor can be really
good, but it's not worth some of the grow
[SPEAKER_04]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Skittles is, I mean, it's a unique
strain because it sucks grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is the worst plant in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It grows so slowly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You basically just don't water it at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And somehow it lives, you know,
twice as long, five times as long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and like people wonder,
you've never done a, like an exam.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never, I never released a Skittles
cross, like direct Skittles cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I probably won't because one,
a ton of the progeny are going to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: like Skittles does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people, you know, don't love that
style of growth.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's difficult and they yield low and they
take forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, hybrids of it, you're able
to kind of bring in some of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I like, I like the turf profile that
it brings on, you know, especially with
[SPEAKER_04]: the crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's a little creamy and it just
helps like round out some of the other
[SPEAKER_04]: like more harsh, intense flavors where
also some of those harsh, intense flavors
[SPEAKER_04]: are too one-dimensional for me,
where you're wanting something else,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, either on the exhale or on the
backend or like something else to just
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of like, you know, make it a little
bit more, well, I mean, literally to make
[SPEAKER_04]: it a little more palatable, you know,
to be entirely honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I agree with you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just sort of looping back to that
point you made about growing stuff out and
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking, God, how do these get big?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had to hazard a guess based on your
Instagram, I see a pair of memes about
[SPEAKER_00]: Oreos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that one that maybe fit into that
category for you guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, it's just when a ton of
people are super excited about something
[SPEAKER_04]: that I don't really find that special or
unique at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's kind of fun to poke a little
fun at Oreos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Structurally, I mean, it looks visually
it's peeling, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it has and I mean, I was really
surprised to learn that it actually washed
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's no flavor, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, if I ever found a fino like
that or, you know, I got I had access to
[SPEAKER_04]: the Oreos cut, but I would never breed
with it just because it has it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: antithesis of flavor, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's plenty of people who argue
like, oh, it's got a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just haven't had a good batch yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I've tried a fair few from dudes
that, you know, I consider to be some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the top growers in existence.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was good, but it was not special.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and life's too short to smoke
something that's just good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want something that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to remember that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite quotes from a past
guest on the show, Show Skunk BA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only got so many lung breaths in this
lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I was interested to ask
because a lot of your menu comprises these
[SPEAKER_00]: really sort of cutting edge new genetics
that like most people maybe aren't even
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was wondering, do you have any soft
spots in your heart for some like maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: unique old world flavors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, you know, you mentioned
you're not a fan of Jack Harrah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are there any other things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I noticed you did some collab
hybrids where one of the parents in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mall was Soma's Lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, that's a bit old
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other old world flavors you
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a pretty good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the affinity that a lot of the people
that came up before me, like five,
[SPEAKER_04]: ten years before me have for Hayes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have that because I didn't like I
missed it, but I have that for OG and
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush's.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I got when I like dived down
deep onto the Kush's, I got more into like
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the Afghan stuff and some of the
like, you know, stuff from the Middle East
[SPEAKER_04]: ultimately.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, Gany, like especially those
like really hashy like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: coffee, funky like land race.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the the black, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the black or not black is it's Cuban
black eyes?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Black, black Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The black.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The black AFI is like because the fruity
AFI is I was like, yeah, they're they're
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's they're a little that coffee
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the like really deep, hardcore,
subtle flavors where you like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, most people are only going to
smell one thing, which like maybe that's
[SPEAKER_04]: how the Hayes aficionados are.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can actually smell all the different
dimensions of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't either.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I don't have that ability, but I can
with some of the lower end stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, like not lower end quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, lower end on the flavor and like,
you know, there's really earthy chocolate,
[SPEAKER_04]: coffee, funky flavors where you're just
like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's hard to describe because you
start getting into like every time you
[SPEAKER_04]: smell it, you smell something different.
[SPEAKER_04]: You start to pick up different notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you smell more things in the world,
you start to have like a better reference
[SPEAKER_04]: of like, you know, smells, which is why I
describe things the way that I do,
[SPEAKER_04]: because those are those are things I've
smelled.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, you know, your scent memory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, that's what I pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're talking about smells,
you and Harry were kind enough to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: some nice little jars for me to sniff on
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about these for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this the the current release,
the next release?
[SPEAKER_00]: When can everyone expect to be able to get
their hands on the next drop?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after we talk about it a bit,
while we can talk a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_00]: smells.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think probably January is where we're
going to start dropping, dropping some of
[SPEAKER_04]: these.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got, I mean, there's a lot slotted
for release.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we try and do is select the best,
you know, just the ones that have been
[SPEAKER_04]: like the most fun and cool and relevant
for that, for that Friday.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: We normally do, we'll do a series,
we'll do a drop every Friday or every
[SPEAKER_04]: other Friday for, you know, four Fridays
or six Fridays.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, plan a couple of weeks
and then we'll do some other drops.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, we want to keep it like fun,
keep it fresh and then make sure that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I mean, best case scenario is
where the drops actually sell out like day
[SPEAKER_04]: one or in the first week, which is fun,
especially for the buyers, because now
[SPEAKER_04]: you've got something that no one else has.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's only I mean, I only do one
batch.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only like one big drop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once all the seeds are gone,
they're they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you ever remake stuff or it's all
one time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Never remake anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: One big batch, which could have,
you know, however many hundreds of packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes it's small.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, some some of the crosses,
like they don't they don't make many
[SPEAKER_04]: packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't make many seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have drops as little as like
10, 15, 20 packs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those sell out really, really quickly,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, then they're gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kind of sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've decided to not remake stuff
because there's not enough time to go back
[SPEAKER_04]: to something.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much more to like dive in and
discover.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather keep looking for something
else, something cool, something unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It raises this point of like, do you think
the market would actually allow you to
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just say you you were testing some
seeds you made and you find this plant in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the equivalent of Skittles
before Skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was like, wow, this is totally
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were like, we've got to breed this
into a pure line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the market sort of allows
breeders to do that sort of project where
[SPEAKER_00]: it like takes longer or do you think it's
just too fast paced, like you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be left behind if you try to like
do it like a pure line sort of project?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of breeders that
have stuff like that on their menu and
[SPEAKER_04]: they have, you know, they found tried and
true varieties that people like and
[SPEAKER_04]: they'll keep making those and remaking
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's nothing there's nothing wrong
with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So see if they find something cool and
they really want to focus on on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's enough people who are doing
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I would rather continue the
exploration to find something new,
[SPEAKER_04]: something different, something better.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's what makes me that's what
makes it interesting for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if I just had to grow the same
thing over and over again and just end up
[SPEAKER_04]: like a job, you know, it's the reason I
like walked out of my sales job way back
[SPEAKER_04]: when I was doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one day I was like, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I moved up into the woods.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one we got the bath house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I do want to ask you about this,
obviously has the bath water in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a very unique name and
description, obviously an homage to the
[SPEAKER_00]: infamous Bell Delphine Game of Go bath
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was wondering, what's the turps?
[SPEAKER_00]: On that one, what's bath water smell like?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a hard one to to like
describe what the smell is of bath water.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely like gassy and funky.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, I mean, you know, imagine what
Del, you know, whatever her name is,
[SPEAKER_04]: imagine what her dirty bath water might
smell like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's that'll get you close enough,
you know, because it is gassy,
[SPEAKER_04]: it is cushy, it's creamy, but it's
definitely it's got this weird like soapy
[SPEAKER_04]: like kind of, you know, not the GMO BO,
like it's more of like a sweaty like gross
[SPEAKER_04]: shirt.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like I don't like a it's hard to
describe, like not quite hockey bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't know if anyone's played
hockey, but those bags have a unique
[SPEAKER_04]: ripeness to them after a couple weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it got me wondering in general,
what what are some of like the more weird
[SPEAKER_00]: smells you've come across?
[SPEAKER_04]: While phenol hunting is the fizz.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is one of my favorites.
The.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oddly enough, the compound apples and
bananas kind of smells a little bit like
[SPEAKER_04]: the fizz does, but the fizz is the loudest
grape chemical.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's fizzy, it's acidic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, the feeling you get
when you like put your mouth into a soda
[SPEAKER_04]: cup, it's too fizzy and a bunch of the
fizz goes up your nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's how it makes you feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you smell it, it's like really like
it leaps out of the jar and then it will
[SPEAKER_04]: stain anything you put in it like any jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you mix up like a couple of buds in a
jar, like they're all going to taste like
[SPEAKER_04]: fizz like forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: The jar is going to smell like fizz
forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like you can crack a jar like a year
plus later and it still reeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's very few flavors that actually
hold on to that kind of a smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that doesn't like because usually
those kind of intense jumpy ones will mute
[SPEAKER_04]: out relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But this one is just I mean, it seems like
it will stay forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one of those ones that just
overpowers everything, but not not tangy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's it's too bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to femme it twice and out of like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the run we did, how many seeds did
we get in that bag in total out of that
[SPEAKER_04]: whole run?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, 50, 50 seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: All pretty immature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 10 different varieties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some some had none seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some had one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some had like four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was like four lightsworth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that maybe the pollen just
didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some things just don't femme well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really hard to femme certain
varieties for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just doesn't work sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got a lot of theories about why,
but it's like I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've I've had plenty of femme runs
absolutely flop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, you're like excited about
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something and then you're like I said,
it takes about a year at least from when
[SPEAKER_04]: you're like, cool, here's what we're going
to work on to the point where it's
[SPEAKER_04]: actually ready to release maybe a year and
a half.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, when when a run fails,
you know, you're immediately three to six
[SPEAKER_04]: months behind that again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Meanwhile, everyone else is crossing
because it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not like the only person in the
network, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the network.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of my friends competition was
like, I mean, technically we're
[SPEAKER_04]: competition, but like I like, you know,
I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody, they're all working on their
shit, too, at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like who's going to get,
you know, who's going to get there first
[SPEAKER_04]: with something that's actually like solid
because anyone could just make a cross and
[SPEAKER_04]: like just femme something and drop it and
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But who's going to like bring something to
the table that's actually like different
[SPEAKER_04]: and special and unique?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I mean, you're sort of getting
towards this topic I was hoping we could
[SPEAKER_00]: touch on, which is that there are a number
of growers and smokers in the community
[SPEAKER_00]: who feel like, in a sense, we're sort of
backing ourselves up against a wall in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to the genetics we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you what's your thoughts on this take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's true?
[SPEAKER_04]: To some degree, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think part of that opinion is
a very narrow view of everyone in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis space who's breeding for making
seeds in any capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where they're like, yeah, you're looking
at a small subset of that entire
[SPEAKER_04]: population that is absolutely doing tons
and tons of poly hybrids and all this
[SPEAKER_04]: other stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's because that's what people
want.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, there's a lot of that we
don't get to make the decisions like you
[SPEAKER_04]: want to have a business that actually like
works and pays for itself and hopefully
[SPEAKER_04]: like keeps gas in your car and like get
your made to be and let you keep doing the
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, so if that's what buyers are
wanting, then, you know, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_04]: you kind of have to run down that that
line or at least like close enough where
[SPEAKER_04]: you're still going to be around.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a lot of people who aren't in
the like standard breeder, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like when they think of cannabis breeders,
there's a lot of people who are not in
[SPEAKER_04]: that space publicly at all, who are doing
all kinds of other work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think in terms of the global
genetics, like there's no issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, like a small network of
growers is growing the same thing and
[SPEAKER_04]: hybridizing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, their gene pool might not be
that great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then growing it with the same
nutrients under the same lights,
[SPEAKER_03]: same media, having all the environment the
same, wondering why the pound price is
[SPEAKER_03]: going down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be a slight problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I still have a ton of
land-raised stuff that I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how many fridges I have full
of seeds now, but it's quite a few because
[SPEAKER_04]: we've just been collecting genetics from
everywhere always and trading and trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to find, you know, new and unique stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm, I mean, luckily we're,
I'm upgrading now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to have a small 7,000 square
foot spot for hunting and popping like it
[SPEAKER_04]: just straight old school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm going to germinate everything in
my library and try and find some cool,
[SPEAKER_04]: cool old stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause a lot of it is getting to the tail
end of its like survivability.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, those haven't been stored.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least I don't know how they were
stored before I got them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, the germination rate on a
lot of the stuff might not be very good if
[SPEAKER_04]: at all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of time to start,
you know, hunting those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we find some cool open pollinate,
make bigger population, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: preserve all that stuff, but it's not
going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would we ever see like any cool F1 hybrids
with like modern versus like maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: land-raised or heirloom or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's absolutely in the plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably not until 2020.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2024, 2025, realistically.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to take, it's going to take
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so I guess just as the sort of
final question on this discussion point,
[SPEAKER_00]: people have this comment that they'll say
everything like sort of feels the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, do you think there's merit to
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think there's still like quite a
bit of diversity within the sort of range
[SPEAKER_00]: of effects you can get from the current
varieties that are really popular?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the best person to ask on effect
because listen, for me, it's flavor is the
[SPEAKER_04]: number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the older I get, the busier,
you know, it's like, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff I would like to smoke, but I,
you know, it's not something I can do in
[SPEAKER_04]: the day and still get, you know,
get everything done.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, I feel like there's still a very
wide variety in effect from a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: different flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes I get bummed out when a
flavor is like really good, but it affects
[SPEAKER_04]: me like, which just my body chemistry or
whatever affects me in a way that I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: like, well, this, I really want to smoke
more of this, but I physically can't,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and then there's other flavors
that are like, I could smoke this all day,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I don't really want to.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, sort of on the other side of
that topic, are there any varieties you
[SPEAKER_00]: think that you would like to use maybe
from your library stash, maybe from other
[SPEAKER_00]: sources that you think would inject some
sort of fresh blood?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or reinvigorate things a little,
just because they're a bit different?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like I said, I'm trying to pop a lot
of this land race stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got like some cool Malawis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a lot of stuff from Africa,
a lot of stuff from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a bunch of stuff from Nepal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did recently get some land race
from Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's apparently, I've got to grow it out
and like, you know, I promised a dude I
[SPEAKER_04]: would grow it out and do an open
pollination and make more of the genetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's a lot of hemp in Japan,
but there's not a lot of like wild drug
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, a lot of people would say
there absolutely is not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my homie has spent a lot of time in
Japan and his buddy lives, I can't
[SPEAKER_04]: remember where exactly they were saying
they live, but there's a drug type of wild
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis in Hokkaido, which is the
northernmost island in Japan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were, I can't remember how many,
what do you say, like it was like a three
[SPEAKER_04]: day hike or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this was like bushwhacking to get out
to these like wild fields.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they would, you know, the homeboy
would always collect as much as he could
[SPEAKER_04]: shove in his bag and then bring it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when people would go and,
you know, hang out or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: he'd always have this like wild herb that
they would smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was, you know, this crazy
Japanese sativa or some sort of hybrid
[SPEAKER_04]: hoop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who even knows what it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there'd be snow on the ground and the
plants would still be alive when you get
[SPEAKER_03]: there to harvest them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still be alive in the snow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently the bricks content was through
the roof.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was somehow they didn't freeze.
[SPEAKER_04]: My theory is always if the, because I've
got some varieties that like bleed red
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, having high levels of
anthocyanin and bricks in there,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that theoretically acts like an
antifreeze.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the cells won't actually burst that
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of those could well survive like
frost and freezing, which is pretty,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's very uncommon because most plants,
if you freeze them, like you can put
[SPEAKER_04]: clones in the fridge for a surprisingly
long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you put them in the freezer,
the cells burst and they die.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can cryo freeze plants though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, tissue culturing and
germ cell utilization is on the rise
[SPEAKER_00]: within cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you foresee a time when that may
surpass like the demand for seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the, I've never actually done the
synthetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen, you know, it's not very common
that people make them and the cost is
[SPEAKER_04]: probably prohibitive for most people,
especially now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe in the future that'll become more,
more common.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as it's relatively simple for the
layman or just a grower to go from that
[SPEAKER_04]: step to actually having like a plant
that's growing in a pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the amount, like you have to know
exactly what you're doing to pull a rooted
[SPEAKER_04]: clone out of tissue culture and actually
get it to survive early on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, that's not, that's not common
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would guess like 95% of even,
you know, growers would mess that up to
[SPEAKER_04]: the point where it just doesn't make any
sense to spend any extra amount of money
[SPEAKER_04]: on something that's like, yeah,
it's definitely better in terms of plant
[SPEAKER_04]: health, sterility, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No bugs, no this, no that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it just, yeah, the level of knowledge
needs to be, you know, at the next step,
[SPEAKER_04]: next stage, which is, it's very
reasonable.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get there in the next five,
10, 15 years, you know, even the,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the lowest, you know, even the newest
employee in any space would probably have
[SPEAKER_04]: some of that knowledge if it becomes more,
you know, it just becomes more,
[SPEAKER_04]: more commonplace and then it's just,
yeah, duh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like everyone knows how to cut clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you could look it up in five
minutes and there'll be a simple enough
[SPEAKER_04]: explanation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now for tissue culture,
that does not exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're on the topic of dirty
clones and pathogens and whatnot,
[SPEAKER_00]: on a personal note for you guys,
have you had much issue with hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: virus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had to clean house or have you
guys been able to get through relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: unscathed?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we do tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: The entire mother stock gets tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it used to be every two weeks,
but now it's pretty much once a month,
[SPEAKER_04]: which, I mean, it just kind of got
expensive to do it every two weeks,
[SPEAKER_04]: to be quite honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do work with a lab in Utah that's
really, really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they test for hoplite and ledescorosis
and a couple of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we've, I've never actually seen
it in any of my facilities, which is very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very lucky.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not kind of a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, it's put a lot of people out of
business, quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also really careful about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our scissors are always sitting in
hypochlorous acid all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have hypochlorous acid in a spray
bottle that gets sprayed on everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tools get auto-plaved.
[SPEAKER_03]: They clean everything with chlorine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like alcohol doesn't kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chlorine is the only thing that kills it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, heat doesn't kill it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, we're very, very careful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my quarantine process, like when you
know, say we have the network to get stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: in, part of the delay is that it takes me
like three plus months to get a cut out of
[SPEAKER_04]: my quarantine into the main area where it
can then go on and, you know, enter like
[SPEAKER_04]: any of the breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it takes quite some time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm hoping to speed that up because
now I've gotten like, I mean, I do all of
[SPEAKER_04]: my tissue cultures in-house.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we do everything ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're slowly getting back to the point
where I feel confident.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're confident enough that we can just,
you know, throw everything into TC.
[SPEAKER_04]: As long as it comes back with a clean lab
test, like for pathogens, then we're good
[SPEAKER_04]: to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we probably shorten that down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice streamlining things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're on the topic, what style
of growing do you guys lean towards more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you salt guys, organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of medium you prefer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us the low down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I run, it's a blend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Organic and synthetic hybrid has always
been, you know, I always think the best of
[SPEAKER_04]: both worlds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow everything in Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy, simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always make the, it's a dumb joke,
but you can't spill a Rockwell cube.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I started in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like most people, I ran cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once I started growing in
Rockwell, it was just, it made more sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was quicker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to spend a ton of time
worrying about the pots or the soil or the
[SPEAKER_04]: this or the that, you know, cleaning up
messes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I want to be able to focus on the
plant itself or like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the other aspects.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still keeping that organic element and
bringing it into Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I still maintain some of the best
weed, me or anyone ever smoked was OG Kush
[SPEAKER_04]: grown in the grossest Rockwell you have
ever seen because it was filled with all
[SPEAKER_04]: kinds of organic crap and this and that
and salts.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for some reason, like that's,
that's the magic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we run, it's a product called Exotic
Ag.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a salt based product.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a bunch of different bios.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stimulants as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my homie Jasper has this company
more and they do, it's like a Archaea
[SPEAKER_04]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of like, I mean, it's like
any beneficial, but it's found in,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's found in tar pits.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's like, it's not actually a
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, there's, it's called Archaea,
which is like, you know, early on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pre bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it can survive like 98 degrees C and
like two pH.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's like, it's just fucking shit's
bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll kill it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: UV is the only thing that kills it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't take over the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It eats, it eats the algae off the
Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it keeps the Rockwell clean,
keeps the lines clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gangbusters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Key lights everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, the flavor, the flavor on the
blended organic and synthetic is the only,
[SPEAKER_04]: like that's the win period.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just straight, straight salt
grown is, it's still good for the first
[SPEAKER_04]: like five days, but I don't know what it
is about the shelf life, but it just
[SPEAKER_04]: drops.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some stuff will hold longer than
others, but I've never had a run without,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, some sort of bio-simulants that
was amazing and still tasted good,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, weeks after you'd chopped it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, crop steering is like the
trendiest word in the industry at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's just going to become
like super commonplace if you're not doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular style of production,
you just like sort of get pushed out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the market?
[SPEAKER_04]: To some degree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's, it's scientifically sound.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's highly functional.
[SPEAKER_04]: It keeps the root zone in the right
conditions, keeps the moisture in the
[SPEAKER_04]: right conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It keeps the EC in the right conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It, you know, it saves a ton of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes, I do it with everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes the most sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's, you know, I mean, cannabis,
a lot of cannabis people like to think
[SPEAKER_04]: that cannabis is super unique and special.
[SPEAKER_04]: And no commercial ag, you know,
has any relevance to it because it's its
[SPEAKER_04]: own thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like that's, you know, I think that's
a little naive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's a lot to learn from large
commercial operate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if that, if it's functional and it
works well, then it's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: People can overdo it like anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I noticed that you guys offer
consulting services on your website.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask you what some of the
things that you think people commonly get
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: People over water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their plants, people to feed their plants
too high.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see their light is too low.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their environment is off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's, you know, like you can look
at a room and diagnose five things that
[SPEAKER_04]: are wrong, like in one and a half seconds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, it's, it's very obvious.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people, they just don't,
they don't realize that all of these
[SPEAKER_04]: things need to work at.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's certain proportions, I guess you
would say that everything has to be at a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you change one, then the others
need to be adjusted for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just change one thing and have
everything else work well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it all works off of itself and off of
the other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, if you have too much light,
your plants need more fertilizer because
[SPEAKER_04]: they can't eat the light well enough
because they don't have enough nutrients.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then they also need CO2, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, it's balancing at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the interplay of them all together.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing is out of whack.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like a, um, what it's some
gear in the cogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That phrase like a spanner in the engine
sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's, it's a kink.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a race car.
[SPEAKER_03]: The faster you drive, the higher chance
something could go wrong, but the higher
[SPEAKER_03]: performance you could possibly have,
you know, there's plenty of people who
[SPEAKER_03]: don't do anything crazy and they come out
with great crops driving nice and slow and
[SPEAKER_03]: Honda Civic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want, you can really crank up
all those parameters and get in a race
[SPEAKER_03]: car.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just chance.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to crash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at the end of the day, there's only so
much carbon to go around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to grow the biggest,
frostiest, terpiest, like pick two,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like you can't, you can't have
it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what, what sort of an increase did you
personally see when you switched to this
[SPEAKER_00]: style of production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how dramatic was the improvements?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, a lot like laughably.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, we've started to see yields
that, I mean, I wouldn't believe it if I
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't, if we didn't have to legally like
put those numbers in a metric,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like no one's, no one's
inflating their numbers into metrics.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you start running some of these
and you're like, okay, we're casually
[SPEAKER_04]: getting 75, 80, like 90 grams a square
foot on these plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we used to do the pounds per light
math way back when.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, we're in like the five
pound range now, which is just absurd on a
[SPEAKER_04]: five by five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 25 square foot, which is back when I was
running DE's or HPS, everything was on a
[SPEAKER_04]: five by five.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't do four by fours until we
started getting the LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, that was going to be my next
question was that have you guys swapped to
[SPEAKER_00]: LED yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I suspect the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the follow-up question is, what do you
think about the people who are discussing
[SPEAKER_00]: and saying like, Oh, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to swap back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they need to dial it in more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that the older lights may
have something over the newer ones?
[SPEAKER_04]: The older spectrums?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's, there's kind of two schools
of thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are putting the impression
that some of the older lights had more or
[SPEAKER_04]: a different spectrum that contributed to
different flavors, higher yield,
[SPEAKER_04]: this, that, the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it very well could be that the LED
technology has not caught up or has not
[SPEAKER_04]: found and mimicked the best spectrum just
yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also the possibility that,
so epigenetics is a thing in plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where if they're grown under a certain
environment or they exhibit a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: stressor, they can change a little bit
where ultimately a one phenome could
[SPEAKER_04]: suffer, you know, a shift and then it will
express itself differently moving forward
[SPEAKER_04]: and forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically one gene turns off and another
one turns on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's also quite possible that some of
these varieties that were grown under that
[SPEAKER_04]: started to adopt more to that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some of the older strands,
which is in the older OGs, where,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you've throwing them under a new
light.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to perform as well
because they've become accustomed to this
[SPEAKER_04]: light having been under it for,
I mean, how 20, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's interesting because I think
we haven't really explored that epigenetic
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect, have we?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a lot of anecdotal experiences
from growers and breeders in the community
[SPEAKER_00]: who say, you know, vegging a plant
outdoors for a season, pulling it in
[SPEAKER_00]: before flower can sort of revive
revitalize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it's there is anecdotal
evidence out there of people saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can revitalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think every grower can relate some
anecdotal experience to a plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: deteriorated in some less than ideal
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may have come across themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to know, though, in terms of your
room, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say you've dialed in all the
aspects and on paper, everything's like
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would you what sort of things do you
think help differentiate producers at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because obviously it's not all homogenous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you still get variation from
grower to grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of aspects do you think come
into play at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it down to like the type of LED
spectrum versus the other guy's LED
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think there's tiny differences
we may not pick up on?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the magic is like for I have a
basic template.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That I use for pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the point of the template is not to
exclusively use the template.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you're running different
varieties, it's to identify what changes
[SPEAKER_04]: in the template need to be made so that
you can grow this plant to the best of its
[SPEAKER_04]: possible, you know, its best its best
potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some are going to need a little more
food and a little more light or some of
[SPEAKER_04]: them need a little less.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, some are going to need to
be watered less.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not it's easy to write like
the crop steering recipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's easy to write that down and say,
this is what you should do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you follow that exactly the way
that it's written, the chances of you
[SPEAKER_04]: finding a ton of success are, you know,
not super high.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to need to be tweaked a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the best growers are the ones who know
what to do, know why what they do works.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't do redundant things like that's
really common.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see people use, especially with
fertilizer and nutrients, they use the
[SPEAKER_04]: same like two different bottles of the
same active ingredient, like the same
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is why?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you doing this?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this is the same.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, so people who have who know exactly
what they're doing, know why they're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: it and can actually make one change at a
time and see the adjustment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you change, like if you run the
same experiment more than once,
[SPEAKER_04]: you want to make a shift.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to only change one parameter
because you change more than one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know which one of those things
it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really hard to do experiments on
living plants because no two runs are like
[SPEAKER_04]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely it's definitely something
where it's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to explain this bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to do side by sides with plants
because you have to do them in your same
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even if we both took a client from a
plant today and took them to our
[SPEAKER_00]: respective locations and went from there,
like you're getting all this environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so even if you do in the same room
and you have two tables that are side by
[SPEAKER_04]: side, it's not really a side by side
because the airflow is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: The airflow is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, like there's just it's
literally impossible to have it be an
[SPEAKER_04]: exact one to one match.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these variables do make a meaningful
impact on the plant long term,
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to do it at a scale that's big
enough to actually take like an average.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of the only way that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's as close as you're ever going to
get is where you've done because if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: only doing a few plants here or there,
like you don't have enough variation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just how do you minimize the
variation?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have like enough of a population
that you can take, you know, your average
[SPEAKER_04]: and see if they're different enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they're not, then, you know,
it depends on what you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it is or it isn't is, you know,
that's the only thing that's relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's get off the growing segment
for a second and let's take a sniff of
[SPEAKER_00]: these jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned it earlier and then we just
totally moved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the bath house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take a big half of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of old school OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that, I mean, not like TK,
but like maybe more like Ghost or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got more earthy pininess to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even a touch of like that eucalyptus
really nice Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, to me, that's like super nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you guys describe it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely get gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's got no sweetness.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few OGs that have a little bit
of like a sweet aftertaste or on the
[SPEAKER_04]: sweeter side.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always preferred, you know, pine tree,
salt water, gas, like just that deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the bath house, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember if I mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Swish, that was part of the reason I
picked Swish is because it was just funky
[SPEAKER_04]: gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has like a little bit of fruitiness to
it, which sometimes come through on some
[SPEAKER_04]: of them, but it's not like sweet fruit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to describe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or like a diet fruit leather.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that even a thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a half is sugar free sweet fruit
leather that's not made with fake sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I love the fruit leather.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one I've got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I pronounce this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to say the second word.
[SPEAKER_00]: London.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, London bish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have it lined up properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: London bish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one's got more going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the London Pelt Cake 75 by the
Swish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hash plant Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely get a little bit of gas,
but it's more eucalyptusy, more like
[SPEAKER_00]: almost citrus, but not citrus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a bit of like nasal flaringness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely like a bit more to it,
but it's like different angles to the
[SPEAKER_00]: smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause yeah, there's gelato lemonade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I can't remember what the other
crosses with the London pound cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but they, yeah, the lemon comes
through a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lemon diesel has always been one of
my, my very favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we grew that way back when,
and it was always super funky and unique
[SPEAKER_04]: and different.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't very gassy.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like at the time we couldn't really sell
it because it was cushy enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't like OG enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It had like a, you know, a different funk
to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, back in the day, everyone just wanted
gas, like 50 different OGs on the menu,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes in waves, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we're getting back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, on that note, next one we've
got is the Geisha Breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, um, it's got a few different things
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meat breath, TK, cherry pie,
Gorilla Glue, Swish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely get a bunch of the Swish,
the Gorilla Glue and a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_00]: meat breath and the TK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really unique sort of smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's cushy, but it's not so
much gassy, but there's a lot of other,
[SPEAKER_00]: like sort of aromatic and earthy notes in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't put my finger on them at all,
which is unusual for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We said it kind of smells like the dragon
fruit refresher from Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it's kind of got that like sour D,
um, edible makeup.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do we call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Animal vanilla smoothie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a sour D and then a softer
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: The animal smoothie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause yeah, that gorilla, the gorilla's
fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, the cherry pie on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there weren't a ton of phenos on
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cherry pie turps came through,
which was kind of a bummer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, there was a few, but it was a little,
it was too light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but the meat breath, the meat breath
TK for sure comes through.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the cherry pie comes through.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can like visually it comes through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although this stacks crazy hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a giant purple spears.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's iced out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, as far as production goes,
it crushes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it did, I mean, this vino did
like three and a half percent or four
[SPEAKER_04]: somewhere in there, like almost 4%,
which is, you know, for rosin production
[SPEAKER_04]: does really, really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but for flower production,
this one bangs and they're super,
[SPEAKER_04]: super potent, like super stony,
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that note, do you pay much weight or
consideration to the ability for your
[SPEAKER_00]: strains to be purely flower produced or is
there more focus on the concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: potential?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like maybe the flowers are like,
you know, not as great as we want,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like it produces incredible
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how do you see that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, the best ones, you can find a fino
that does, or you can find more than one
[SPEAKER_04]: fino and like also like a hash fino and
then also like a flower fino, but that's
[SPEAKER_04]: my favorite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not all varieties will do that,
but some of them you can actually find
[SPEAKER_04]: really, really, really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Flower, uh, flower finos, which they have
this, my homie Watson, Dustin,
[SPEAKER_04]: who did the, uh, the cold heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: He always described it as like a rosebud
sort of structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I like to think of it more like,
uh, what's that shit called?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Brussels sprouts where you just have
these giant fully shaped nugs growing off
[SPEAKER_04]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And instead of having this one huge
homogenous cola, which you can't break
[SPEAKER_04]: down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you do, it looks terrible,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you have these like perfectly
shaped flowers that just go all the way up
[SPEAKER_04]: the stem, that's kind of my ultimate
favorite, but those are, they don't wash
[SPEAKER_04]: as well because they're dense.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't open up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes, especially you find these
more, they really look like older kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: sativa ones where they're bigger,
they're more open.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a little airier, which not
structurally or visually appealing for
[SPEAKER_04]: like most people, but in terms of hash
production, they bang.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're only ever going to grow those
for hash, we grow them hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of CO2.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want them to Fox tail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want as much surface area as possible so
we can get big numbers on the wash where
[SPEAKER_04]: no one cares what the flower is going to
look like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only ever going to be released as
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what sort of varieties do you
recommend for anyone who's listening right
[SPEAKER_00]: now who wants like a really good washer
specifically out of your catalogs,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe from the upcoming line?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know they're all designed to
wash well, but what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone is like, dude, I get the
flower, I immediately turn it into heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheetah chew washes really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: The turps are super fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the cheetah chew.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything with that lemon diesel in it is
killer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got this lemon, honey mustard,
peppery.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's funky.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a weird smell.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that one washed at like a little over
four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the cheetah chew is banging.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gorgeous flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a collab up in Washington right
now, so that's going to be coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, people who are in Washington
state will be able to go get flower and
[SPEAKER_04]: hash of the cheetah chew here very,
very shortly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other one would be the gummy,
the jelly zonut zoda.
[SPEAKER_04]: So both jelly zonuts is a huge washer.
[SPEAKER_04]: That phenol that we crossed is a monster.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the zoda, that phenol of zoda that I
picked is another, another washer,
[SPEAKER_04]: four or five percenter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that one did.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was five or over five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was big, big, big washer a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So gummy will come out in January.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't set a date yet, but January.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the gummy is my, my personal
favorite of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all, they're all amazing of the
five people around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the gummy hits that sweet spot
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's got gas, but it's got a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me in some ways of the pine
soul cut of goji.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goji from Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, it's like gassy,
but it's got this interesting berryness to
[SPEAKER_00]: it that comes at you in a unique way where
it's not just like through the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like around the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like gassy in the middle and then
like this sort of more sophisticated
[SPEAKER_00]: perfuminess around the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the gummy a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The gummy is kind of like a, like a acidic
acai kind of, you know, berry floral,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, grapey skittles and then gas,
biscotti gas, biscotti gas, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting because the Zoda cut that I,
that I use for all these crosses is the
[SPEAKER_04]: most offensive dead animal, like,
yeah, rotten dead animal at a truck stop
[SPEAKER_04]: that like had a bunch of, you know,
oil spilled on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, it's, it's rank and it's
weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it smells nothing like any of the
parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the parents were a lot more
fruity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Floral and kind of shirby and kind of
berry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was like, I was almost certain
that that seed I'd fucked up cleaning the
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds and it had gotten, you know,
from something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I grew it and I'd looked at like
the photos and like the structure of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, well, I mean, it's definitely,
you know, it's definitely Zoda,
[SPEAKER_04]: like no question, but this was one of,
I don't know, it was like a hundred and a
[SPEAKER_04]: hundred plus phenols that I looked at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was the only one that smelled
anything like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was also the washer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't an easy choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to know, I was looking through
your Instagram and I was sort of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a sense for myself of like,
what's one strain would I guess you would
[SPEAKER_00]: be most known for, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought the Zoda, it appeared enough
that I was like, maybe it's in contention.
[SPEAKER_00]: What strain do you think most represents
the brand just in terms of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: public's perception?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think people most associate
with you guys thus far?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Zoda for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Zoda is one of the heavier producers
that's in, you know, in rotation at the
[SPEAKER_04]: most, you know, rec and med shops and most
growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a, you know, relatively big
release.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I saw a seed pack of Zoda at
auction sell for like five grand,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been super awesome if they
shared some of that with me, but hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the fact that it went for that,
which is outrageous is yeah, fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look on that topic, I noticed on your
site, there's probably only about three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four strains that are in stock by the
looks of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, do you find it hard to
keep up in terms of seed production
[SPEAKER_00]: matching the demand?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The, the, the feeding frenzy that can
sometimes occur is awesome, but it's hard
[SPEAKER_04]: to keep up with and trying to make enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really like having, since I have
to test everything and I'd have to grow it
[SPEAKER_04]: out and then I have to have it tested by
the tester network.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the release, instead it takes me a
year, a year and a half to do the release.
[SPEAKER_04]: And 95% get cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: If not more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, man, probably, probably maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: 95, 90, 95% of the stuff that I make just
doesn't make it for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's not, it's not good enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, if it, say I get a cut
that makes it through quarantine,
[SPEAKER_04]: makes it into rotation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I grow it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like cool enough that I think maybe
this will, maybe this will do well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make the crosses of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll grow some of them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if they're kind of like,
I mean, either they get discarded entirely
[SPEAKER_04]: or they get thrown back in the fridge for
a rainy day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like maybe we'll come back to it in five
years, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then stuff that hits that everyone,
you know, everyone at the round table is
[SPEAKER_04]: excited about.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what makes it to release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think that there'll ever come a
time where you look to ramp up the
[SPEAKER_00]: production or do you think you'll always
sort of keep it this small scale sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: vibe?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, probably ramp up to some degree
just to keep, like as, as the market gets
[SPEAKER_04]: bigger, I want more people to be able to
have and smoke more and unique different
[SPEAKER_04]: Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do like that, you know, the
community of people who grow mommy,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like a smaller group of people who
really appreciate what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think part of, you know,
like I'd never got into it to make this
[SPEAKER_04]: giant mega seed corp that is just going to
bang out the same variety over and over
[SPEAKER_04]: and over again.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it's been done.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people that want that and that's
great, but I want to make, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll keep it relatively small.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, you know, at one point I had like 30
employees and that was a, it was really
[SPEAKER_04]: hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was insanely difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's, you know, me and Harry,
a few others, it's a lot easier to manage,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and having direct access and
functionally doing all of the work makes
[SPEAKER_04]: more sense, especially if I'm going to put
my name on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I don't want the company to get too
big where we like create something and I
[SPEAKER_04]: never grew any of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it gets released and it's just like,
you've lost, you've lost the, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the personal touch of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've lost the, yeah, it's just not for
me, not for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, you mentioned a few times that
you've done some co-labs and maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: some in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: What collaborations do you have coming up
and what sort, who are some breeders who
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to do some co-labs with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got some more super seed collabs
coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've got a couple Tiki collabs in
the works.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else we have going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: The super seed is going to be the next one
to drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Social soda.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super seed co-collab, which I love.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love super seeds there.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done them for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Seattle soda?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a bit about that strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's out of control fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, it's kind of like a Sherb esque
sort of purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a, it's a UV perp and so
delicious, which is another cross that the
[SPEAKER_04]: homie made, which has got like,
I mean, it's funny because it has train
[SPEAKER_04]: wreck and like lemon haze in it,
but it doesn't, I don't get any of those
[SPEAKER_04]: flavors from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's definitely, yeah, the Seattle
soda is like a cushy, grapey.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely fizzy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely has that like not,
it's not got the same grape turp that the
[SPEAKER_04]: fizz has.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's like grape gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is more like grape cream,
like a, like a grape creamy chapstick or
[SPEAKER_04]: something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got this like, and yeah, I don't know
if anyone remembers those like old
[SPEAKER_04]: flavored chapsticks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't have that chapsticky waxy bit,
but it does have that definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like kind of artificial grape with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's the acidic, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very like prominent in the nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: You feel it like right up in your next to
your eyes, you know, like it's all up in
[SPEAKER_04]: your sinuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you're doing collabs,
do you ever consider like working those
[SPEAKER_00]: lines forward or is it generally more of
like a one-off special thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like, you know, like the fans
can't really get it from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get it from either camp
individually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be the collab or do you think
that if you found something cool,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd like, you'd just work it forward?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I would never, for me, it doesn't
make sense to make the same crossover
[SPEAKER_04]: again, but to make an F2 or a back cross
or any of that, like that, that's still
[SPEAKER_04]: open game.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think that's, it's different
enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in terms of like my sort of rules for
umami that I like to follow, that doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: break a rule and it's still, it helps to
inject something different and unique and
[SPEAKER_04]: you can still dive in and hunt and find if
someone wants that exact same,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they could find, or if they want
something else, I kind of draw the line at
[SPEAKER_04]: S1s.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really sure why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've just, as in you don't want to
do S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I wouldn't do a Zota S1 for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's I, if we did, I'm sure they would
see banks tell me all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should do that because it would do
really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm that's not, I don't know that I'm
not interested in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not excited about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I haven't done it enough
where maybe I, maybe if I do it and I find
[SPEAKER_04]: some super awesome Finos and it's like,
what have I been missing?
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's so much, you know,
there's so many other things that I want
[SPEAKER_04]: to work on.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's definitely on, you know,
on the tail end of projects that we might,
[SPEAKER_04]: we might go forward with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: A back cross is far more interesting to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, I can understand where you come
from with that one for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we jumped into the interview,
we were talking about it and I had it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may as well jump into it now,
but I wanted to ask you about your
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on sort of the, the conventions
of naming strains, because I noticed a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of your strains have the words R or Z in
them because you know, relating to the
[SPEAKER_00]: parentage, do you find it hard to come up
with names?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think you're ever going to find it
easier?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just getting more infinitely harder
to come up with names as each sort of year
[SPEAKER_00]: goes by?
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on the, the hybrid,
to be entirely honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes they, the name just
materializes, comes to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even really have to think about
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just presents itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish that was the case more often
because normally there is a lot of effort
[SPEAKER_04]: expended on figuring out a good applicable
name for the thing that is unique,
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't step on anyone's toes,
hasn't been used before.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, you like early on it was
always like someone crossed, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: black, I think it was black, uh,
black widow and Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they call it black Jack because right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, but eventually we ran out of the
ability to take both of the, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: some combination of the name.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's only so many things that you
are even remotely creative or like sound,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, interesting enough to use.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then we started doing a lot of the Z
stuff because people, and really I was a
[SPEAKER_04]: little against it early on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm like, well, that's kind of dumb.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, whatever, everyone's using
the Z.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like, well, it, you know,
from a scientific perspective,
[SPEAKER_04]: it helps for people to have some
familiarity with what is in the thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's a Z in there, really,
it should have Skittles in it to some
[SPEAKER_04]: degree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I think that's been like,
I did that more than I'd like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I'm really trying to get more
creative on naming, but it takes a village
[SPEAKER_04]: literally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll have like 10 or 12 people hang
out, smoke the strain, talk about it,
[SPEAKER_04]: look at the genetics, dive into the,
you know, long history on the genetics and
[SPEAKER_04]: really like try and identify something
that's unique and cool, but it's so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, on the other end of it,
how do you feel the name game affects the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial success of a strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like a catchy name is sort of
a fundamental part of a strain really
[SPEAKER_00]: getting traction with the broader
community?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of them, especially if it's a
smaller release where I like a name
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's funny, like bath water,
for example, you know, like we'll bath
[SPEAKER_04]: water cell at a shop possibly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the thoughts when we're naming
stuff, it's like, Hey, if, if this is on
[SPEAKER_04]: the menu at a dispensary, is someone ever
going to want to smoke this?
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to, you know, like the name has to
be good enough that someone's interested
[SPEAKER_04]: or appealing in some way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think a lot of, even like a
lot of strains that are really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really good, they kind of fall off or you
just end up renaming them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, you have such a variety of unique
strains in your arsenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to just like, basically
interrogate you on a few of them to find
[SPEAKER_00]: out more, cause I'm just genuinely
curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kiwi Sherve, grab my on your website
because I think you sort of said like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's maybe like a bag seed or something
like people aren't a hundred percent sure
[SPEAKER_00]: what that one is, but I think you've made
hybrids with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know, do you have much info on that
one?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're talking about, that was
from Tiki is that Kiwi Sherve cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was from the Tiki collab.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we gave him our Zuchi,
he had it to a clone only.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause yeah, I sent him my Zuchi cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our male.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then yeah, he had a bunch of his
clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he sent me one of his females and I
reversed it and I made the fems and I sent
[SPEAKER_04]: him a male and then he made the regs.
[SPEAKER_04]: That Zuchi, that Zuchi male is
bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about the Zuchi male.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard the name before.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it like as a strain?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Zuchi is, let's see how to best
describe the Zuchi.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Zuchi is a monster.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't, I never was a big fan of any
of the females in that line that I found.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were really good, but nothing blew me
away except the male.
[SPEAKER_04]: The male is this big monster, stacky,
giant cola making male that like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you've seen males that have like
a lot of little bananas and they're like
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of sparse all the way up the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: This makes giant bananas out of all of the
pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it makes like full, so it looks like
bananas made of little tiny bananas.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the craziest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just iced out from tip to toe.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I found that male, I actually
misidentified it as a female first time
[SPEAKER_04]: because it didn't, it didn't have any male
traits whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was sexy, the first population,
I was like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I threw it in to a room to test
it out for flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it turned into a male.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, looking at it and it was
all frosty.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, well, we're definitely keeping
this cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's going to be a definite
win.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I've been running that generation
for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that one started back on the original
release of the MacMint male pollinating
[SPEAKER_04]: all my stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I found a male Froyo, which was the
MacMint by the Sunset Sherb.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it started, it started at MacMint,
then it made Froyo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then on the Froyo male, that was crossed
it to Biscotti.
[SPEAKER_04]: That became Ken Tucci.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I crossed that to Skittles.
[SPEAKER_04]: That became Zucci.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I found another male from that,
crossed that to Angel Mints.
[SPEAKER_04]: That became Swish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I found the female from Swish and
made the reversal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been working on that male,
like population since like 2016,
[SPEAKER_04]: 2017.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know everything about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's easy to pair stuff now because I
know exactly what it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know exactly what the phenols I'm
looking for are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like I said, it's bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool that you've like continued on
the project in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me wondering in general,
do you have a specific process or traits
[SPEAKER_00]: you look for when selecting a male or is
it more like a certain one just sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: speaks to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely speaks to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: They, a lot of people think stem rub is
something to go off of, kind of got back
[SPEAKER_04]: and forth on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's really like,
it doesn't give me enough of an indication
[SPEAKER_04]: one way or another.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had plenty of things that had no stem
rub that came out really, really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the other way around as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Selecting males for me primarily was
vigor, structure, no signs, of flowering
[SPEAKER_04]: in veg.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any auto flower tendency is gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do anything that has any like
hardcore auto flower tendency in my,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I'm not growing out of flowers,
not viable for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So none of that structure, like I said,
I mean structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like veg structure and then flower
structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what's the stack?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the stretch look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then ideally, this doesn't always,
not always the case and not necessarily
[SPEAKER_04]: indicative of a male that's kind of,
you know, when you, awards or,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, destroy, destroy stuff and just
be a fucking killer is frosty,
[SPEAKER_04]: frosty males.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I've had males that have tested
seven, nine, 10%, which they're iced out.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's trichomes all over them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever tried to smoke them?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I would probably die.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm deathly allergic to pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had, what's hay fever since I was a
kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all pollen I'm allergic to and then
cannabis pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to wear my like big giant
respirator that like covers my eyes too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll wear like a Tyvek and then I will
literally like walk that whole,
[SPEAKER_04]: after I'm done pollinating or like
cleaning seeds or whatever, I'll walk that
[SPEAKER_04]: whole rig in like under like a shower and
I'll like rinse myself down and try and
[SPEAKER_04]: like knock the pollen down after having
taken a bunch of like Benadryl or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it'll just, yeah, I could never
smoke a male.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would probably die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a few more unique females I wanted
to ask you some questions about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you about the lemon
pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounded very unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lemon pepper is a super fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is a, I didn't make that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a cut that I got from my homie,
from the network.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the lemon pepper is one of the only
strains that smells exactly like what
[SPEAKER_04]: lemon pepper smells like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super, super floral and this like
lemon mustard funk that also was really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really peppery.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, it doesn't have hardly any bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a really ugly plant,
which is kind of unfortunate because the
[SPEAKER_04]: turps are out of control, but it breeds
really, really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably 75% of the progeny look
amazing, but you do get like 25% that are
[SPEAKER_04]: ugly as hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're big.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the lemon dairy, what we made out of
the lemon pepper, the cross that we did,
[SPEAKER_03]: the ugly one was the tastiest one by far.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lawn clipping one, like I,
I saw the Fino, I discarded it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, this thing is so horrible
looking.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the ugliest thing ever, but I had a
couple ounces.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like everything else, we dried it
through into bags and then yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: the lemon dairy number three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, how I wish I, I'll find that Fino
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just got to hunt through the seeds,
but that was the ugliest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, literally looked like lawn
clippings.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it was horrible looking and I didn't
trim it and we smoked that stuff and it
[SPEAKER_04]: was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the most lemon, like actual lemon.
[SPEAKER_04]: People describe Jack as lemon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of get like a little upset about
that because I don't like, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of strains that are like lemon,
like true lemon, like lemon peel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like not like the sweet sesty,
but the like more like funky lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like bitter with the pith and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me wondering what's the most
memorable terpene you've ever smelled like
[SPEAKER_00]: when you think in your mind, like what's
just, if I say what's the craziest terms,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what jumps to mind for you first?
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a, the strain way back when I
don't actually remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was some diesel cross, but it tasted
exactly like dryer sheets, exactly like
[SPEAKER_04]: dryer sheets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had like maybe two grams of water
hash that I got at the Emerald Cup and I
[SPEAKER_04]: smoked the tiniest dabs of that for like
six months.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will look, until the day I die and find
that same terp profile again.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like if you just crunched up a bunch
of dryer sheets and started chewing on
[SPEAKER_04]: them, that is what it tasted like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: So delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it gets, we sort of get into this
territory of like, do you think that the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains name should at least try to
accurately represent the flavor profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think like it doesn't really
matter?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, I don't think it matters that
much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's very difficult to not make
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you only chase those types of names
that will make more sense on the
[SPEAKER_04]: description, then everyone, like a lot of
the names are going to be really the same
[SPEAKER_04]: because a lot of the flavor profiles are
pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, how do you differentiate the
thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we need to have the more people
get into like higher end products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like one of the things legalization in
Vegas did, which is kind of interesting is
[SPEAKER_04]: that they have mandatory terp testing on
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of people, they won't necessarily
only look at the cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll look at the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like though the terpene profile is
about as unique as anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like if you wanted to map genetics,
you can just as easily map them with their
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene profile ratio as you can with like
their genes or at least like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: for, for all purposes, it's close enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm hoping we have like enough like
flavor indicators or something else that
[SPEAKER_04]: people could look at and say, okay,
I'll, I have kind of a good idea as to
[SPEAKER_04]: what that, these are flavors that I like.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I could make a selection based off of
those parameters, not just based off the
[SPEAKER_04]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, look, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the way the market's going to evolve
to influence the way they select things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed on your website,
you had something really unique on the
[SPEAKER_00]: pineapple soda description.
[SPEAKER_00]: You sort of talked about the different
flavors you get from your puffco at
[SPEAKER_00]: different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually thought this was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of novel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't really seen it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think providing this extra sort of
focus description, maybe focused towards
[SPEAKER_00]: like concentrates, given that's what you
guys breed for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that'll become like a more
normal thing going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that just like a fun little thing
you did for that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Harry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we try to incorporate more of the
hash before the seed drops now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like all these flavors in front,
we already have them in big hash
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we want people to know exactly what
it can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a reasonable hash number.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how can you move forward?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, having that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah, some things definitely
have different flavors depending on the
[SPEAKER_03]: heat that you hit it at.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like between 400 degrees to like 550
might be a totally different experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you might be able to really
taste it more at the 400, but that higher
[SPEAKER_03]: heat can give you like some different
flavors you might be missing in a
[SPEAKER_03]: different way, depending on like what
temperature those turps burn at,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, have you noticed that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Different turps have different boiling
points.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they flash off too quickly,
then you only get some portion of the
[SPEAKER_04]: total turping profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: So temperatures is very dependent on
flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or I guess I should say flavor is very
dependent on temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just referenced like, you know,
having these strains in production before
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed drops happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your sort of ideas on the breeding
in, sorry, on the testing landscape in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of, do you just prefer to do it all
in house?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever give stuff out to the public
and say, send us your results?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think it's possible to test
everything in the current breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a lot of other guests have sort of
said it moves so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe you can test a few things and
be like, you know what, this male seems
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty solid, but sometimes it might be
hard to test absolutely everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you fall in terms of your beliefs
on testing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the product has the name on it,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of that, like the brand,
I want, I always want the brand to have
[SPEAKER_04]: integrity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if I'm going to release something,
we're going to drop something.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has to be, it has to have integrity and
it has to have been tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has to, you know, sort of fit
within the values of Umami Terps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we test everything we release
ourselves, myself, and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: in-house, we also send it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got like a pretty big tester network
on discord now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've got a good set of people who are
really, really capable and really,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, able to give us an accurate look
at what someone who might receive a pack
[SPEAKER_04]: of seeds is going to experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's very helpful to know how they're
going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bred them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to be able to grow them really
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will someone else who doesn't have the
same setup, doesn't have the same
[SPEAKER_04]: knowledge, it's going to grow in a
different media.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to grow under different light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I, they need to, they need to be
workable for enough people where then we
[SPEAKER_04]: can release, release something.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, everything gets, gets tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: And ideally we do everything in-house
forever, which it's, I mean, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I don't, as long as it all
gets tested and I have multiple people
[SPEAKER_04]: running it at, at, you know, at least a
large enough population where I know
[SPEAKER_04]: there's not going to be any major issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't see how you can last in
the space if you have a major flop,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, if you do a drop and.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything herms and there's a million
problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then like, was it worth it to do the drop
or would have been worth it to maybe wait
[SPEAKER_04]: six months, a year, and then do the drop.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like is, is being first with the latest,
whatever that important?
[SPEAKER_04]: And for us, it's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus like I can't because I have to make,
you know, a hybrid or create something
[SPEAKER_04]: else and then run the, you know,
grow them out, which is why it takes like
[SPEAKER_04]: a year and a half before we have a
release.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I have all of 2023 and the first
two quarters of 2024 already mapped out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why, when I was saying some of
those land races aren't going to come
[SPEAKER_04]: until 24, 25, because that's the next
available time they can come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that it's mapped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've definitely got to have a goal to be
able to reach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask specifically, you know,
you guys have got an impressive 28 cup
[SPEAKER_00]: wins.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it like to have that level of
competition success?
[SPEAKER_00]: And does it result from you guys
submitting stuff or is it from like people
[SPEAKER_00]: who have bought your gear and then they
submitted it?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm actually really proud to say that
is all collaborative works with people
[SPEAKER_04]: growing Umami genetics and then submitting
them to shows and winning.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and that's, I mean, that's the
coolest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one that they can take something that
it's very proof positive that what I've
[SPEAKER_04]: worked on some of those flavors are
awesome because I like them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But does the community like them?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they workable enough that,
you know, someone's going to grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of different people that
make seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of, you know, there's a lot
of great cuts out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that had enough to stand on its own to
make it through anyone's selection process
[SPEAKER_04]: of staying around and then be the entry
and then be the entry that took first,
[SPEAKER_04]: second or third.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, on that note, what advice would
you give to someone who's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in getting into breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you advise them in terms of
like, you know, what to do and what not to
[SPEAKER_00]: do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just start, just start making,
making crosses, make hybrids, hunt seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: find something cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably give them out at first.
[SPEAKER_04]: See if you can get some people to grow
them for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, find it's going to be easier if
you know someone who has like any sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: scale who can grow, who can help.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get you off the ground because it is,
I mean, unless you have a ton of money,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's not an easy thing to break into,
especially now where the demand,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the requirements for people
producing seeds or people running genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: are so high.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've never been higher.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want biggest, strongest, frostiest,
turpiest.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're just like, you know,
you have to have, you have to start with
[SPEAKER_04]: those genetics as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just find whatever fuck off gear
at your local dispensary and then like
[SPEAKER_04]: make a cross and think that that's going
to like run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you, if you want to put your kid and
you know, if you want your kid to be a D1
[SPEAKER_04]: athlete, you better make sure like you're
a D1 athlete and your wife is a D1
[SPEAKER_04]: athlete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics definitely play the biggest
factor in the sort of success of a newbie
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that topic, what genetics excite
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to get into next?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm kind of diving back into some of
the old, the old school, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a lot of the OGs back.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're popping a lot of land race stuff,
trying to find, I mean, there's,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's sort of this homogenous structure
and turf profile that has become,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, very popular now, which is great
signal for me to start to shift away from
[SPEAKER_04]: that and find something else.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always tried to find like our own
lane, still close enough that it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, an easy, easy move for people to
go from where they're at to, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: where I want to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the last thing you want to do is go
like too far left or too far right where
[SPEAKER_04]: you're just like super excited about some
flavor profile and like no one else is,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is fine for small projects and like
just for, for you and your friends or
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to actually want to impact
like the space, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole, cause it's a global community,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's 28 event like worldwide and
like 10 of those are in South America or
[SPEAKER_04]: seven are in South America that we,
you know, my homie, we're doing a collab
[SPEAKER_04]: with a sugar seeds and they've been
winning every event that they enter,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is, you know, there's not as much
competition down there, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and having West coast genetics certainly,
certainly helps.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's going to be exciting when there's
a lot, you know, higher level of
[SPEAKER_04]: competition and we can still, you know,
compete.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it's fun, the events are fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you touched on an interesting point
because it's like, it's one thing to make
[SPEAKER_00]: a cross, but then it's another thing to
actually have people want to grow it out
[SPEAKER_00]: and want to grow it out maybe around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess you're giving me a good
opening to ask this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I did want to ask you, like,
do you think you would ever breed
[SPEAKER_00]: something without cookies in it in the
sense that like, do you think like a
[SPEAKER_00]: project like that could really succeed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think like these days,
like it's sort of, you're not really
[SPEAKER_00]: playing to the, to the market,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, to breed something that doesn't
have any cookie genetics in it at all is,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's still plenty of crosses
that I've, you know, that I've made that
[SPEAKER_04]: don't have, don't have cookies in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've got, I said, there's fridges full
of stuff we've never released because it
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't necessarily the right time and the
market wasn't in the right place.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that said, there's how many,
you know, it eventually becomes a backbone
[SPEAKER_04]: to some degree, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like OG, like some of these other,
like, you know, Oh, is anyone going to
[SPEAKER_04]: stop breeding with like GANI genetics or
like, you know, eventually when you go all
[SPEAKER_04]: the way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder in 20 years, is it going to be
like NL or it's like NL is just in
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, I think we're just,
it's too early to be able to look back and
[SPEAKER_00]: go, Oh, that's just the new paradigm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just, cause there was probably a
bunch of Afghanis got wiped out by NL and
[SPEAKER_00]: people were probably not happy about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's just like, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when cookies is however many
generations back, it comprises what
[SPEAKER_04]: percentage, you know, very, very small,
ultimately, you know, you can get that
[SPEAKER_04]: down to 20, you know, 20% of the genetics,
5% of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't take that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, true, true, true.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's merely one small fraction
in, you know, this big polyhybrid that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just like a structural component or
something almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask you, I've been weirdly
feeling, not weirdly, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sort of surprised me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the vibe that like Sunset Sherb and
Gelato are like making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys get that vibe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I out of touch or is it the children?
[SPEAKER_04]: I always like Sherb.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sunset Sherb was one of my favorites
of all time.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the first time I smelled it,
still one of my all time favorites.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will smoke that forever, but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think people are getting more back into.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just been around and it's
going to stay around.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's such a good flavor
profile, especially for someone who's just
[SPEAKER_03]: getting into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's almost like having them smell a
tangy when someone doesn't really know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like they can only describe cannabis as
smelling like, like weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they like, I don't know, it smells
like a plant, but if you can give someone
[SPEAKER_03]: like a real like tangy orange,
they're like, Oh, I think I can smell the
[SPEAKER_03]: orange in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like with like a good Gelato or a
Sherb, when you smell that bag,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like, Whoa, I can actually smell some
like sweet, like candy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is different.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't, this isn't just weed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like for that reason,
it's just always going to stay around.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also love Sherb.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean there's Sherbs, maybe it
doesn't island strain for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's staples and the people,
people get to decide what becomes a staple
[SPEAKER_04]: and what falls out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fully, fully while we're on the topic of
gelato, I wanted to ask you lemon cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato, another like hot name in the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just being runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I talked to other growers who are
like actual growers and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I've grown them side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've grown the lemon cherry,
grown white runs, two different cuts of
[SPEAKER_04]: runs, pink runs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, who's to say what is actually
what?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there just becomes too much
like, it's like the game of telephone
[SPEAKER_04]: where someone passes the cut and then
it's, it's this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so like I've seen, I've seen cuts of
lemon cherry that were not the cut of
[SPEAKER_04]: lemon cherry that I ran.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the cut of lemon cherry that we have
is this like kind of the more prominent
[SPEAKER_04]: ones from, you know, we got it from the
Bay, like my homie up in the grass valley.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've grown them, you know,
like I said, two different cuts of runs.
[SPEAKER_04]: One looks very similar to the lemon cherry
and one looks nothing like it grows
[SPEAKER_04]: totally different, different stem
structure, different leaf structure,
[SPEAKER_04]: different flower structure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's so hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus if you grow it in a different
environment, with different feed,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, physically it'll look different.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll appear to be, they could be the
exact same cut and they'll look like
[SPEAKER_04]: wildly different phenos.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just so hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Could be, could be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you guys about like your
thoughts on the lag time between like
[SPEAKER_00]: strains being released and then like maybe
when it actually starts to get some public
[SPEAKER_00]: traction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is sort of exemplified by
the fact that Leafly just recently
[SPEAKER_00]: announced that JBZ's jealousy was like
their clone of the year or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was interesting because
I remember JBZ did like the huge clone
[SPEAKER_00]: drop of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like about a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, okay, so you could sort of
say it was about a year, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or sometime between that, between like it
getting out into mass circulation and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the public being like, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you agree that like you reckon 12
months is about the time lag from sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: when you maybe start getting it out there
to when maybe the end of the consumer is
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to maybe get hyped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your thoughts on that time lag?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like, does it make your job as a
breeder harder?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's some strains will come out,
like they come out of the gate hot and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's no, there's virtually no lag time,
which is not, not always the case,
[SPEAKER_04]: but some come out hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some, I think, you know, 12 months is
probably you're like 10 to like 10 to 15
[SPEAKER_04]: months is probably your average.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what's interesting is you see strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be out for like two or three years
or like four or five years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of a sudden, for whatever
reason, they blow up that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're just like, what happened?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where, where did this come from?
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been around and now all of a
sudden it's hype and everyone's after it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's kind of interesting to see like
some of those get rediscovered what had
[SPEAKER_04]: been, you know, they've been in hiding,
which sometimes it's just coming up with
[SPEAKER_04]: a, a clever new name and some fancy logo
and, you know, some bubble letters,
[SPEAKER_03]: but not always.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bet you RS 11 will be the next Leafly
strain of the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the next big clone drop by that
gang.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to be surprised if in a year
from now RS 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably will.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the tail end of the questions,
I wanted to ask you, are there any
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders you haven't worked with?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're maybe not necessarily friends with
heck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, maybe they don't even breed
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like super old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any breeders you like wish you could do
collaborate with or like use some of their
[SPEAKER_00]: work, um, sort of like, you know,
fantasy football style question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's so funny because they say you
should, uh, hustle hard enough until your
[SPEAKER_04]: idols become your rivals, which,
you know, is, is a true statement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and there's, I mean, there's a lot of
breeders in the space who've like
[SPEAKER_04]: contributed like a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but once I got, so like five or six
years, like if you asked me that question,
[SPEAKER_04]: like early on in the career, I would have
been like, Oh, this person, this person,
[SPEAKER_04]: this person, this person, but maybe it's
just kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I just, the, the more I get into
like my own, my own gear and like finding
[SPEAKER_04]: like my own stuff, there's so much in
there that like, I haven't had the proper
[SPEAKER_04]: time to really go through the rest of the
fridge and hunt all of my other flavors
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know, find something new and
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: In, in that, in that category,
but I mean, who, who like for you,
[SPEAKER_03]: who do you think would be, would,
would mesh well with Umami Terps?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question about who,
you know, if we could just tap on the
[SPEAKER_03]: shoulder and ask them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we've been lucky enough to do
collabs with big, you know, big names.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the Stravinsky collab fucking crushed.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, you know, Tiki supersedes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like collabing with people that I,
I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've worked with in the past,
you know, we're, we're super cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I like Soulfire's gear.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd do something with Soulfire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soulfire would be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I mean, you know, Mike, like
fucking, you know, we have a couple cups,
[SPEAKER_04]: but like fucking hell, no one has more
cups than exotic Mike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike's got cups for days and they've been
in the space since forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he's, he's a G.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that would be, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that'd be kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those are some solid answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I wanted to ask, cause I'd be curious
to know, uh, I'll get an answer from both
[SPEAKER_00]: of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite strain for head
stash?
Fizz.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fizz.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's so unique and so different
than anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't grow very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like got kind of a strange structure,
but just the smell when you break it down,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like, yeah, it's like fresh,
fresh cherries.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like injected with CO2 somehow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I mean, I like the Fizz.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cherry pie is one of my like desert
Island, all time, all time favorites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cherry pie is gas, super heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Fizz is kind of like cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's similar, but it's like a more intense
cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's more cherry pie than
cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I love cherry pie, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah, more grapey.
[SPEAKER_04]: But mine right now is probably the,
uh, so my homie hunting did this cut of
[SPEAKER_04]: poison gushers, which is the F1 derb by
the gusher.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that one's out of control.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like some of the most umami turps of all
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I crossed that with swish.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we call that poison with a Z,
which, you know, I don't know if we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: release it as that because I'm kind of
getting sick of going down the Z rabbit
[SPEAKER_04]: hole too, with too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the poison, um, right now,
I mean, right now it's just PP number six
[SPEAKER_04]: is how I pass with poison number six,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So PP six.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six is my, my current favorite right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now something that's maybe going to be a
little left of field, but I love doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what's something you're passionate
about or a hobby you've got outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like to do when you're not
with plans?
[SPEAKER_04]: I play golf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking, I got, I mean, I, I played golf
growing up, but I played just for fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there was a course by my house
that was like university course.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like $7 to play like nine holes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'd just go and, you know,
smoke weed and like hang out and do
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, yeah, I got back, I don't know,
probably 2014, 2015.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like went to Roger Dunn and got like fit
for a set of golf clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, I just got so hooked.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I love being outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd bring the puffco, dabbing,
hitting, you know, hitting some golf
[SPEAKER_04]: balls.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you, Harry?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a fly fisher.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I grew up in Utah, grew up fly fishing,
mostly for trout.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then recently I got into saltwater fly
fishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go to the Bahamas once a year and do
saltwater fly fishing there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's being humble.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, you know, professional level of
fly fishing, him and my dad, like I I've
[SPEAKER_04]: gone with them a bunch and they are both,
they, they leave me and my other brother
[SPEAKER_04]: in a different boat because that's like,
look, if you're going to be in this boat,
[SPEAKER_04]: like we're running and they, they'll
catch, I don't know, 50 fish, 60 fish.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me and my youngest brother will catch like
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe two, probably one between the two of
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow on question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite meal?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm like kind of simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like steak.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Steak and potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what, like, what do you get it cooked
to medium rare?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, black and blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a filet black and blue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like all day, every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respectable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some simple, you know, simple man.
[SPEAKER_04]: You grill it on fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a big potato.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think like Japanese style ramen probably
be my number one right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some pork chashu and soft boiled egg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: My top five is ramen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look, that brings us to the final
five questions we ask everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one being, what is the single
most memorable experience you've had with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't necessarily mean like the
strongest dab you've had, but just like
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you're in a concert and like it just
hit right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you're like, what's the most
memorable thing to you with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I first moved to California,
I was living in Utah and I was growing and
[SPEAKER_04]: trapping and being a goof.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, you know, pushed my parents to the
limit and they were like, you need to get
[SPEAKER_04]: the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like go to California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe like, we don't know what to do
with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So leave.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had just gotten to California and I'd
spent my first night out here and we got a
[SPEAKER_04]: bag of OG Kush, $70 an eighth from my
buddy's homie.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember waking up on the couch at
his place in orange and I was smoking out
[SPEAKER_04]: of this like stupid pipe that had like a,
like a lion or something on the front,
[SPEAKER_04]: like one of the like dumb, you know,
like a leopard panther, I think it was
[SPEAKER_04]: like a black.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just weird, but I was sitting
there smoking this pipe and I was just
[SPEAKER_04]: like, okay, this is going to be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this is, this is going to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't, I didn't have it all planned
out at the time, but like that was the
[SPEAKER_04]: first moment where I was like,
okay, I can, I can kind of start to see
[SPEAKER_04]: how I want this to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harry, what about you?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in college, I lived in the Caribbean
for a semester.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sold bed sheets to people who came in on
cruise ships.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a weird time, but I lived on St.
Thomas, really pretty Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got a bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: Master Splinta was the name of my drug
dealer there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never learned his name, but just give him
a call.
[SPEAKER_03]: You home?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drive by.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'd just be sitting in a lawn chair out
front, walk up, dime bag, 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we went up to like the highest
point on the Island and just smoked a
[SPEAKER_03]: joint up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, yeah, just hit right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other end of the spectrum,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All your homies are hyping up this strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, Oh fuck, can't wait to try
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally comes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super unimpressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did people rate this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What strain is it for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The blue, the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was, uh, I was unimpressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was a little upset.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was still hooked on OGs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the blue dream was kind of meh.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we got a cut of double dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which was basically just blue dream 2.0
and, uh, still upset about that one,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it yielded well and it paid the bills.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we kind of had to, you know,
had to run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to keep hating on Oreos,
but I've seen some Oreos hash that looked
[SPEAKER_03]: incredible and someone was hyping up and I
smelled it and I just got, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do we call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, LaCroix like, hint of Oreos is kind of
what I described like hint of,
[SPEAKER_03]: hint of Oreos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and the flower the same way I saw the
jar sitting there and I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I got to get some of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I remember smoking it and just
being like, Oh, this like, bummer.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to the Oreos lovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you referenced earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm going to drop you off on a desert
Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take three strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: What three.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're definitely taking.
[SPEAKER_04]: An OG cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to say which one because,
you know, I don't want to, that's too
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult, but an OG cut, um, definitely
taking either Fizz or cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then probably, Oh, that's,
I mean, honestly, like I've been smoking
[SPEAKER_04]: on this rainbow belts 2.0 recently,
and I could probably smoke that hash every
[SPEAKER_04]: day until I died.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So overpoweringly soapy and weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it gets me the same weird,
that's as close to the dryer sheet turp as
[SPEAKER_04]: I've found, like definitely in the profile
of cleaning products.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it's, I always joked,
like I thought Skittles or, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: rainbow belts tasted like if you made a
butter croissant, but used Dawn soap
[SPEAKER_04]: instead of like water in the dough.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just, it's got this really
creamy, delicious, but soapy, like well
[SPEAKER_03]: soapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'd say probably the rainbow sugar,
which is a cross we did a Fizz.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's got those same kind of Fizz turps,
but it's got maybe like a little more
[SPEAKER_03]: stony, um, probably like something like a
rainbow belts or the Skittles,
[SPEAKER_03]: just cause that's such a unique flavor I'd
want to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, man, I don't know what for my
third one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, maybe like an OG, like a Larry
OG or just something like total really
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Final question for each of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a time machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back anywhere, anytime,
any place you can get either seeds or a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to get?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm going to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, how long do I have?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I want to do the whole hippie hash
trail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do the old school shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to smuggle a bunch of hash in a
surfboard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to, I want to do all of the things
that I always read about, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like my parents, friends doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just going into parts of the world
that are like absolutely inaccessible to
[SPEAKER_04]: this day and tasting and finding stuff
that it's definitely extinct at this
[SPEAKER_04]: point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, and maybe it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe it's just like, oh yeah,
we have all these flavors today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like this wasn't, you know, like,
cause part of the scent memory,
[SPEAKER_04]: you like fan that you romanticize flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you've had this where
like, you don't have something for a long
[SPEAKER_04]: time and then you try it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, ah, man, it's just like.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not as good, you know, like it
doesn't taste as good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, is it, or did you just like
romanticize it and make it better in your
[SPEAKER_04]: head?
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, I mean, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Harry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you go into the future with this time
machine?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably just want to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, is it something that everyone just
romanticized and they thought really
[SPEAKER_03]: smelled like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we do have it now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is everyone just lying now and it's
something that did exist and is now gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, Lupa told me it smelled like,
like a dead animal skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was like, no, it didn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not skunk one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't this fruity sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smelled like legitimately.
[SPEAKER_04]: It smelled like a skunk, like a dead
animal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've only smelled a couple of things
that were even remotely similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were like diesels and like some
sours that Zoda is about as close to dead
[SPEAKER_04]: animal skunk as I've gotten that Zoda 16.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would, I would want to smell that like
actually something that was verified.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's the, that's the mystery on
the, you know, everyone claims to be the,
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the keeper of the skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I wish, I wish whoever has it,
they're, they're not on the internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's some old dude living in
the woods, like don't have the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some guy offline for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's just sitting there in his
backyard smoking his roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a care in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end of things.
