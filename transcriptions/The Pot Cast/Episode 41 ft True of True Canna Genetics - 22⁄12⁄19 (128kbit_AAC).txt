[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All righty, guys, a big thank you and
welcome to our friend True of True
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannagenetics for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, bro, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, my friend.
Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're going to start this one off with
our new favourite one to start it off
[SPEAKER_01]: with, which is, what are you currently
smoking on today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I rolled up a joint of True Love,
which is a cross of a Filipino land race
[SPEAKER_00]: and The Truth, which is a strain I won a
high times with back in 2004.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to go on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go on the one I was a little more
interested in touching on first because
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll obviously touch on The Truth quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Filipino land race, how did you come
across that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen anyone with a cut like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most incredible story for a
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, I love the strain for so many
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend I met when I was in
Amsterdam, a Jewish friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: called Zohar.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most adventurous, quirky
characters I've ever met in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just an oddball of the highest
calibre.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I probably like him because
we're so alike and so different in that
[SPEAKER_00]: regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after living in Amsterdam,
for a few years, he then moved to
[SPEAKER_00]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved to Barcelona, haven't been in
touch with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm walking along the street and see him
coming towards me with this girl,
[SPEAKER_00]: hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh, Barry, what are you doing
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, I've moved over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was staying at a friend's at the time,
just kind of looking for somewhere to live
[SPEAKER_00]: and get everything settled in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out he was doing tours of the
cannabis social clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was an idea that me and him came up
with when I was in Amsterdam because
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram had kicked off by then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said to him, like, go and do the
tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take people around to the different clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can basically, what happens is people
take people around to the clubs and they
[SPEAKER_00]: just charge a small fee or get a cut of
the entry fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they're able to take people to
like three or four different clubs during
[SPEAKER_00]: a day, find out kind of what kind of
people they are and pair them up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis social club.
[SPEAKER_00]: That suits that kind of person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he, while he's doing it, he meets this
Filipino girl who's on like her first big
[SPEAKER_00]: holiday away from her mom and like on a
kind of journey of self discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they fall in love.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pretty much jacks in his job and is
just on like a well wind romance at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he tells me like, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm going back to the Philippines to
meet her mom and her brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's, that's what I love about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like he just goes, he's everything
wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no like messing around this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He puts his whole heart into everything he
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go meet them and she's just the most
beautiful, kind hearted, wonderful person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And him, like I said, he's just the most
wonderful guy and a super adventurous
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for him, he's down for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a trip to the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within like a month, I think they were
maybe like together for a month in
[SPEAKER_00]: Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it was time for her to go
back, he went back with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he goes back, he's over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a phone call from him and he says
like, bro, this is not looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mom is so upset that my girlfriend has
kind of had this journey of self
[SPEAKER_00]: discovery, falling in love and come back
with me that I am not feeling well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brother is like the dictator from
North Korea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's looking at me like he wants me
executed at any moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm saying to my friend like,
bro, be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are rich people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will have you go missing like for
pennies, just like be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's not an idiot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said to me like, now don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing some sightseeing and we're
coming back next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't hear from him from a little
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden I get a phone
call from him while they have gotten to
[SPEAKER_00]: the airport and are about to board their
flight back to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: His girlfriend has been arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you couldn't make this shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, bro, like what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said that he's then missed his
flight and he's now trying to get in touch
[SPEAKER_00]: with her friends to find out what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or trying to get help and alert them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily he had like her Facebook login
had been done on his phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was able to try and reach out to
some friends and try and get help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But literally like spent maybe a week or
so doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: During his adventure, he met another
Jewish guy and said to him, brother,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am under pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to help me find some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this other guy goes out of his way to
find him some buds and gets him like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Filipino land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that Filipino land race, there's five
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my friend saved those five seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a week or so of not being
able to get in touch with his girlfriend
[SPEAKER_00]: and not being able to find out what's
going on, he comes back to Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes back and stays with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while he's staying with me,
I start the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a couple of weeks, he gets a phone
call from his girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's in a mental institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's managed to get one of the girls that
works there to let her use the telephone
[SPEAKER_00]: secretly away from everyone and tells us
that they've diagnosed her with love
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction and they're literally drugging
her and giving her counseling.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I hadn't have heard the conversation
myself and been there and then heard the
[SPEAKER_00]: voice messages that succeeded it,
I would have been doubtful if this is even
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blew my mind to think that something
like that can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then my friend, as you can imagine,
he's like, there's nothing he can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's super upset about it,
but he kind of like has constantly got her
[SPEAKER_00]: in his mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a little while, he gets a letter and
this letter is just like a dagger to the
[SPEAKER_00]: heart letter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it is the most damning,
like by going on my Facebook, you broke my
[SPEAKER_00]: trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it broke down so many things said
just destroyed and broke his heart
[SPEAKER_00]: basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to say to him that look,
bro, this looks like someone put a gun to
[SPEAKER_00]: her head and made her write it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, you're in
another country.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to get on with your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of crazy right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's so wild and I can see it's
depressing you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get on with your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, I decided to call the
strain that I was growing Lovesick the
[SPEAKER_00]: Filipino because of the love addiction
diagnosis that she was given.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a neat name to a potentially really
dark story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the craziest thing of all,
bro, is that a month or say six weeks into
[SPEAKER_00]: vegging the plant, I took a cutting from
it and it bled red.
[SPEAKER_01]: That exists in like, you know,
one of Bodhi strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so rare though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's like amphocyanins or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure of the exact pronunciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only ever seen it written,
but yeah, I think Bodhi's got a strain
[SPEAKER_00]: called Dragon's blood that does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know about that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have pointed out to me when I
actually found it, people have pointed it
[SPEAKER_00]: out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that strain there, it goes like
dark purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most unique, hardy strain I've
ever grown in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it grow in a propagator in a
dark room where the rest of the trail cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: died, discarded, all molded and just
fluffed over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I went in there, the Filipino
cuttings had grown to the roof of the
[SPEAKER_00]: propagator and we're trying to find light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's it like as a plant in terms of
like flowering time and the high and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering time is quite long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've got it to finish to an
acceptable degree in Barcelona outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: because I flowered it all the way until
the first week of December.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But indoors, you're looking at like you
could get away with 14, but really 16
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks is where it wants to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if I really wanted to,
you could probably push it to 20 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those kinds of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's weird like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the truth is indoors, it's never as
good as it is outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what my plan is to do next year is to
start flowering it indoors, like six weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: before the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outdoor schedule flips to flowering
and then take it outdoors and finish it
[SPEAKER_00]: off for another 10, 12 weeks outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets like 20 weeks altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that sounds nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's the high like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful cerebral, low anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't got the luxury of being able to
get things tested easily, but I get the
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling that it's got CBD in it just for
the fact that there's none of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart pounding, sativa, anxiety from it,
but it's got a beautiful cerebral,
[SPEAKER_00]: calming, euphoric kind of mildly
psychedelic high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what have you been able to get the
flowering time down to when you crossed it
[SPEAKER_01]: with the truth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I finished a whole bunch outside first
week in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stunners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get 10 weeks to 12 week finishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what kind of flavors do they have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they leaning towards one side or in
the middle or what do they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the regular version, way more
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the regular one, the flowering time
is more varied as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the feminized version that I've
just done outdoors, it was a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there wasn't so many crazy
sativa ones and there weren't really true
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of evened it out a bit more across
the board, which is what I find with Femme
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of evens things out a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, with that, the flavors are weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest, it's so hard to describe,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't got a point of reference for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of in a floral direction,
but I can't compare it to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's making it super difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the same with the lovesick cut
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give you a point of reference to
tell you what I think it smells like or
[SPEAKER_00]: what it tastes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of those ones I need to,
I need more people to try it because
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be people with more experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes someone will smoke one of your
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've got a strain Truzilla,
which is turpzilla crossed to the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I'm smoking it or smelling it,
I can pick up on fruits that I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll pick up on a mango note or like
grapefruit I can discern easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a little pineapple smell that
one I can pick out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when someone else comes along,
I've heard someone go like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smell papaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't tell you what a fucking papaya
smells like for the life of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just have to take it that that person
has got more papaya experience than me and
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're just picking one of the notes
out because it's familiarity, which often
[SPEAKER_00]: makes them jump out to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sounds like a pretty sound
theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back to the start though.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think literally my first ever
experience of cannabis was from like a
[SPEAKER_00]: super irresponsible like family member
where one of my aunties who's like
[SPEAKER_00]: semi-degenerate, basically my little
cousin, when we were going on a walk in
[SPEAKER_00]: the countryside, suggested to her to let
me have a pool on a join.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was my first poke of a joint was
from my auntie when I was like probably
[SPEAKER_00]: about fucking 11 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super irresponsible, like not the kind
of thing that anyone should be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess the fucked up thing is that
your favorite auntie when you grow up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you realize was the most degenerate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the gist of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my first experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And always like I remember seeing her and
her boyfriends and older cousins,
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever they would roll a joint and smoke
a joint, I could see from a child the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference and how happy they were when
they were smoking that joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there was always an interest
from when I saw people smoking when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: younger, I could see the change that that
made in people and how everyone was
[SPEAKER_00]: laughing, smiling, a little bit happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was from a young age,
I kind of had that interest and
[SPEAKER_00]: fascination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so where did it go from there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you continue to smoke as you grew up
beyond 11?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was like a concept that couldn't be
like the idea of it was baffling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know, even when I think about
it, I was baffled by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only other thing I maybe tried
was like I tried smoking a cigarette one
[SPEAKER_00]: time and then I didn't smoke again until I
was like, I think maybe 14 in secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started smoking with one of my
friends, a crazy little Indian kid that I
[SPEAKER_00]: went to school with that was just wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got smoking with him and then
another friend of mine, his dad was
[SPEAKER_00]: Moroccan and he would always get hash and
he would smoke hash with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that would have been interesting
having access to such a kind of much more
[SPEAKER_01]: high quality and more potent high.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you realize like that was something
special or was it just kind of whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash was so prevalent where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from like Northwest London originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not far from Labyrinth Grove,
Labyrinth Grove, Portobello road market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's loads, a huge Moroccan
community there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's loads of Moroccan calves and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the Moroccan population in
that part of London, you've always been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to access incredible Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also back then even there was a lot of
good Indian hash as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot more variety, but the
Moroccan has always been a little bit
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of took it for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the real first experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of hash that was smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: My early experiences were going halves on
a five pound draw of hashish with a friend
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting two pound fifties worth each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's always, that's a lot of the
reason why you kind of start smoking with
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that becomes the culture in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even when you smoked flowers,
people would say, Oh, you need a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of tobacco to help it burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was this kind of mythology around
needing tobacco to combine it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what were the first strains that you
can remember the names of smoking growing
[SPEAKER_01]: up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me have one guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, bro, that's the funny thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember the day my best friend phoned
me and said, Barry, get whatever money you
[SPEAKER_00]: can and come round.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got this new weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like my head's a bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like a balloon on a string.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, okay, I'm coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point it was like five pounds
for a gram of like imported bud or five
[SPEAKER_00]: pound for a gram of Moroccan hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, I think it was like 10,
10 pounds for a gram or maybe more,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was at least double.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea of all of a sudden having to
spend double that for this tight little
[SPEAKER_00]: luminous green stinking bud that just was
called skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was like 95, 90, 95 when we started
to get that beginning of 95, I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: was around then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And was that like a kind of a paradigm
shifting moment for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it like, huge, massive,
massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high and the difference in your effect
was so impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smell, the flavor, everything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like in your mind as a kid,
you're like, my God, what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory did this come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: What scientists provided this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll happily pay double.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just like, our heads were spun.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long was it between that point to
when you first started your own grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have been 15 then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically had like a journey from the
age of 15 to like 20 when I started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing properly where my dad and his best
friend would grow a couple of plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: our back garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as kids, we didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we got to the age of 15,
we realized, and that was part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so, this is a great story that
you'll love, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, this is the kind of funny shit
that just like, you have to laugh at.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started smoking at 14, my best
friend, I wasn't smoking with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he found out and told his fucking mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his mom was best friends with my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our dads were best friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one morning I go to school to meet him
and his brother and cousins to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his mom says to me, Barry,
can you come here with me now and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: talk with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she pulls me into the bedroom and
gives me a lecture about smoking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that I'm a 14 year old and
that cannabis isn't the worst drug in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, but it's not appropriate for a 14
year old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at school, I should be learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brain's still developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't be smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she gave me such a legit talk and said
to me like, look, I'm not gonna say
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing to your parents, but stop,
don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was so on the level that I
literally stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was like, bro, I've got such a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I believe that she's not gonna say
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that reason, I'm just gonna stop
because I've gotten off lightly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how harsh, my friend, I'll be honest,
what it was, my friend at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was so jealous that I was smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so afraid to do it himself and get
caught that he ended up snitching on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like, he's like outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bro, literally for then, for maybe six
months or nine months, I didn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would have like friends at school,
particularly these two girls that I always
[SPEAKER_00]: used to smoke with there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time they would buy the
weed and I would always roll it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they would come to me and I would have
to roll the weed and I wouldn't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd stand with them and I had such like
good like restraint that for like six or
[SPEAKER_00]: nine months, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day my friend comes into
school and says to me, oh, me and my
[SPEAKER_00]: cousin smoked weed last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: We asked my parents and they said,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's now got permission from his
parents to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, my mind's blown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it is is that his dad used to
grow some outdoor plants every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd like give away 95% of it and
maybe smoke the odd joint for himself on
[SPEAKER_00]: his own, like one night when all the kids
had gone to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really just enjoyed the growing the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got to the point where my friend
and his cousin went to his parents and
[SPEAKER_00]: just said, look, we want to try cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd rather do it at home and ask you and
see what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the English culture is that
you're allowed to drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parents will let kids drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing for them to go like,
oh, you're 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a beer at 14.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a shandy at 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people give their kids alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: From early, I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents are very liberal with drinking
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we went on holidays, for instance,
like a summer holiday, two weeks to
[SPEAKER_00]: Cyprus, we were allowed to drink a few
cocktails.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're allowed like two cocktails a night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when your kids and it's
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like a normal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bar staff wouldn't even care for
you to ask your parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would just serve you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the alcohol culture in the UK that
exists is just extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people just get into a negative kind
of social state of like thinking that the
[SPEAKER_00]: only way you can socialize is to drink
alcohol and go to places where everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: paralytic drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: People prey on one another or hitting on
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got girls worried about getting
drinks spiked about being too drunk and
[SPEAKER_00]: people taking advantage of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: People getting into fights because of the
alcohol and the stupidness and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although to some people it may seem
crazy, for kids to go to their parents and
[SPEAKER_00]: ask them that, it was probably a sensible
thing because I'll be honest, what it done
[SPEAKER_00]: is in the longterm, what it done is that I
then asked my parents if I could smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: They discussed it with their best friends
who had more experience about people that
[SPEAKER_00]: had smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they come to the decision that look,
if they want to try it, let them try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to do it, let them do it in
the safety of our own home.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a weekend as a sociable thing,
one of them is 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one's 17, almost 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one's 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can leave home now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can have sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get married soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they want to try it, then really it's
better that we know what they're doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: we have an honest dialogue with our kids
because otherwise what will happen is they
[SPEAKER_00]: will hide smoking cannabis and then all of
a sudden that just opens up a gateway of
[SPEAKER_00]: deceit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole dishonesty thing and my parents
never brought me up to be dishonest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one thing that was always
instilled into me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, look, you can come back from
anything, but if you're a liar,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard to bounce back from being a
liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you fuck up, if you make a
mistake, whatever you do, admit it,
[SPEAKER_00]: own it up, deal with it, but don't be a
liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to that, it was like my
parents, it was kind of hard for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: get their head around at first,
but in the end they just kind of said,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what would happen is they would
give us, this is the funny part,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would give us like, a little bit of
bud from the crop that his dad had grown
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors, but they didn't have an idea
about what we smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were asking them for weed for the
weekend and they were giving us like a
[SPEAKER_00]: half ounce of this bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're like, yeah, yeah, that should be
about okay for Saturday and Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would have enough to just
slowly last us throughout the week and you
[SPEAKER_00]: just slowly become regular smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the age of 15, I was consistently
smoking and it was the only hash that we
[SPEAKER_00]: would buy from my dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the only hash that we could buy
from other people to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the skunk came in, there was
commercial bud like Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_00]: I missed out on Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like once we had something that
claimed to be Thai, but it was dubious
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't know if it's the same with
you, but now they send bud from anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world with just string thrown in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there's no stick, but they think
that if they put string in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: people just think it's Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in England, you'll get people always
posting pictures like, yeah, I've got this
[SPEAKER_00]: authentic Thai and it's got a bunch of
string in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, guys, that's just from
Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's shit weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just put some string in it to like as
a unique selling point so that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: convince you that it's Thai stick or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to send people like pictures of
like a Thai stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just got some string fucking
wrapped around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me about your first grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that like?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I grew was one small plant
outdoors and it yielded about 10 grams and
[SPEAKER_00]: it blew my mind how good it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then literally I had my best friend,
he had two plants growing outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: veging, and I decided that I was giving up
tobacco and the best way to do it was to
[SPEAKER_00]: start growing on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got these two plants off of my
friend, put them in the corner of my
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom, went to Ikea and got a blackout
blind, went to the grow shop got some
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got a 400 watt HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had no fan, no filter,
no tent, no nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally just had it in the corner of
my bedroom with a wardrobe kind of half
[SPEAKER_00]: boxing it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at night I would just turn everything
off and I'd be in my bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even I'd watch a little bit of TV because
I was like, you know, you have no concept
[SPEAKER_00]: of like a hermaphrodite really at that
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't really know what I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of like winging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just grew that in the corner and the
real inspiration that got me like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that made me want to grow was the book
Hashish by Rob Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I fully grew indoors from one of
the head shops where I would buy like high
[SPEAKER_00]: times magazine, rolling papers,
bongs and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the book Hashish in there and I got
that book and read it from front to back
[SPEAKER_00]: and literally when I got to the end of
that book, that's when I decided like,
[SPEAKER_00]: nevermind a little outdoor plant every
year, just like it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to become a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I understood so much about the
plant from reading that book that I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that I got Jorge Cervantes book,
the grow Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I literally read that in something
like 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went insane reading this book front to
back and literally finished it the next
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I went and got all my
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how long was it before you found
your way onto the forums?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in Jorge Cervantes book at the very
back of it, it had seeds direct and
[SPEAKER_00]: overgrow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually had the website links.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is when I read that book,
I actually discovered overgrow and seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to get my first ever seeds
from Gypsy Nirvana's original website and
[SPEAKER_00]: also go onto overgrow, which just blew my
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the memorable things that
you remember being around for on the
[SPEAKER_01]: overgrow website or forums?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just so overwhelmed by everything
that was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, just a strain base.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was obsessed with the strain base with
all the information about the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if there was a Jeopardy special
subject thing on strain base of overgrow
[SPEAKER_00]: and genetics released from like 2000 to
2010, that would be my specialist subject
[SPEAKER_00]: because I would go through that in such
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew every breeder, every strain name,
what the background was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just incredible to go on there and
to see some of the growers on there was
[SPEAKER_00]: just wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so who were the breeders you were
looking up to at that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, to begin with, it was always the
Dutch breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always a big fan of serious seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Serious seeds to me, the way they actually
done their breeding and came with
[SPEAKER_00]: everything was incredible for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I got onto the forums and started
to see all this American genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when things really got interesting
because everyone in the UK was growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch strains that I was familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the people that I knew,
those strains were available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always the interest of getting
something unique that kind of got my eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the minute I saw all of these unique
breeders, like I remember getting bog
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, one of these boggle gum and some
other things that were like deep wreck,
[SPEAKER_00]: things that like, you know, if it had an
elite clone involved in it, it was some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of American genetic that was like a
clone only.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone was working with something like
that, that is what attracted me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like I wanted to grow things out
that I knew when I passed a joint to
[SPEAKER_00]: someone in the UK, they were going to be
looking at the joint for answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you pass a joint around to
people, they take a toke and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the joint as if to say,
hold on a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they look around for some
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it was things like,
I remember getting sour bubble from bog
[SPEAKER_00]: way back in the day, which is like a
bubble kush cross bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same flavor, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of flavor is just next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with sour diesel, same with like
train wreck turps, same with OG Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: turps, the minute chem dog flavors came
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I grew out a lot of those flavors
pre-2010 and it was like revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when Oregon kid done those OG Kush
S1s, that was just insane for us,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro, to have OG Kush like in the early,
early 2000s was just wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always looked out for those boutique
breeders, the little like crazy guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: had something with a story behind it,
something from that no one else was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing that had like documented photos
that you could see you're onto something
[SPEAKER_00]: special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a cool backstory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's one of your favorite kind of
nabs in terms of packs you picked up off
[SPEAKER_01]: the site, just off the top of your head?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, this is, this is one of the
ones that deserves a mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a guy called JLP, John Lee
Pedermore.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was probably my greatest discovery on
over bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he transferred over to icmag.com when
that started up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was a guy called JLP, which stood
for John Lee Pedermore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he done, he would make seeds and
give them out free.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was the only person that was
allowed to like get addresses from people
[SPEAKER_00]: directly on IC Mag and was allowed to do
that and deal with people direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would send out thousands upon
thousands of packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd done the most incredible seed
projects with all the latest, greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that maybe other people weren't
able to snag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd done cool projects where he'd
done like he'd done a cross once,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was, I loved the concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd done two strains called Romeo and
Juliet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't remember what the genetics
were, but it was the same cross done both
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he used like a male New York city
diesel cross something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he used the female New York city
diesel versus the opposite male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he released them as both Romeo
and Juliet so that people could grow both
[SPEAKER_00]: of them together and get an idea of what
the male and females impart differently
[SPEAKER_00]: and have some kind of side-by-side
comparison to see what the results were
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cool little proof of concept of
doing side-by-sides with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the question that jumps to mind
immediately for me is, do you feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: when you do a kind of a sense check
yourself like that with the two variant
[SPEAKER_01]: strains, do you feel like really at the
end of the day, what you're testing is
[SPEAKER_01]: your ability to select a good male?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what if in just one case you pick
a dud male and then in the other you pick
[SPEAKER_01]: like a good one and that's the reason why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why you get such different results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a hundred percent, a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, like the concepts is
wonderful, but depending on the work
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gone into it is how it's variant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does make that difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you see huge difference because like
you say, without the male being,
[SPEAKER_00]: without knowing what your male does to
begin with, that's, that's one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite things is to actually figure out
what does a male do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that should be the goal of all
breeders to have that as a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: pastime, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be a unique thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shouldn't be like a mind blowing
concept to people, but they should be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to give you a list of what a male does and
be able to show you in a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses those results consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we'll touch on that in a bit,
but I just want to rewind for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you were snagging some cool patterns.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've overgrown something I picked up on,
which is really probably one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious things people will pick up on
about you if they Google you is that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're quite well known for your cut of
Casey Jones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this where you picked that pack up
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey Jones, basically around 2000,
I think it was in 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like maybe three, two or three years
into my being on overgrow maybe two years,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd been on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overgrown now would like kind of got
clogged down and there was loads of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of, it lost the community vibe,
the bigger and bigger it got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then IC mag started up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I discovered that the website
gypsy Nirvana seeds direct, they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: shop not far from London, which was like
within driving distance to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the day, you're so paranoid
about dealing with anything in the post
[SPEAKER_00]: online, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I contacted them and said like,
Oh, I do work down there is only chance I
[SPEAKER_00]: can pass by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said like, yeah, we've got a
shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had like a little head shop where
you could go in and see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I went down there and actually
met them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they started IC mag, that was kind
of like a big massive thing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got into IC mag and that kind of got
the IC mag cup going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I started to meet American
growers and breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the IC mag cup and through IC mag is
where the world of the industry and the
[SPEAKER_00]: community really opened up to me because I
was able to see other people's flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: that had been sent from America.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to try cup entries for the IC
mag cup from res dog and Jimmy knits and
[SPEAKER_00]: smokey, the puff master, all of these guys
that had the East coast sour diesel car
[SPEAKER_00]: and got to try elite genetics and got to
have my own bud there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I was always someone that sent a
shit load of bud over or took it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always had a rucksack with like five
Tupperware containers full to the brim
[SPEAKER_00]: with different flowers and always wanted
to like see what was around and what was
[SPEAKER_00]: available and see what people thought and
try better things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was when I, I got the Casey Jones
seeds was when I met their heads because
[SPEAKER_00]: they were visiting Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I met them at the IC mag cup,
got the seeds off of them and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: next year I entered it in the IC mag cup
in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I met them maybe 2005 and then
2007 IC mag cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had grown it out, done massive
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like, I selected not massive
selection in the amount of seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but massive selection and like dialing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was so obsessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first real time that I decided
to like keep clones from seed selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only did I do the selection,
but then I grew it out so many times and I
[SPEAKER_00]: flowered out like 40 plants and chopped it
every single day from week eight to week
[SPEAKER_00]: 11.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had them all jarred up with the
exact day on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would smoke them and whittle it
down to the, to the 10 best days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I grew it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I chopped down like five plants
on each of those 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went through the best ones and
whittled it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm like, all right, day 64 is
the day for this Casey Jones cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this plant here is the best one of
that batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one I'm going to enter in the
IC mag cup this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really thought about my entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't put full into an
entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for me, the key to winning a cup like
that is if there's a 35 gram requirement,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to provide 35 buds that weigh
approximately 1.1 to 1.2 grams so that by
[SPEAKER_00]: the time the person takes out the twig and
breaks it down, they get their gram
[SPEAKER_00]: sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one has to break up big buds of your
entry because when competitions have to
[SPEAKER_00]: start dividing things up and doing those,
they're under pressure and they haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: got time to gently break up your big bud
that you sent in because it was your best
[SPEAKER_00]: bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't work in a competition unless
it's one where they're keeping half of it
[SPEAKER_00]: for a judges panel that wants to examine
it in that detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes down to individual judges,
you really think about presentation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the trim job, a nice boulder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't use the top buds that have been
directly under the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for the second shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always pick those like, you know,
like if you're picking one gram buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's never going to be those tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the middle level ones that
have got the best frost, that have had a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of protection, that are just
stunning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the words of Peabud, the shoulders of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave the heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you entered the cup and what was the
end outcome?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to finish the story for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically I entered that year and at
this point, a lot of the UK were entering,
[SPEAKER_00]: but everyone was smoking with tobacco in
the UK at that point, even a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers from ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although other good growers entered,
when it came to all these Americans being
[SPEAKER_00]: over and judging, I was growing cocoa and
had been growing pure for seven years,
[SPEAKER_00]: like six, seven years by that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was so obsessed with the flush that
mine smoked so well and I had such a good
[SPEAKER_00]: entry and it went off so good that I
finished second place to John Lee
[SPEAKER_00]: Peddermore, JLP with Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew out Sour Diesel and got first
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came second with Casey Jones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me to come second to one of the
internet legends was just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: a dream come true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That for me still is just the most
incredible one because it opened up a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole world of friends and amazing
contacts and just everything blossomed
[SPEAKER_00]: from that point onwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like an awesome win.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the thing which immediately jumps
to mind for me is when you first started
[SPEAKER_01]: growing it out and dialing it in,
did you realise how special of a cut it
[SPEAKER_01]: was or did you think it was just pretty
good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, I knew it was nuts, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing was yielding ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first plant of it, I yielded 12 ounces
from the seed plant in a 10 litre pot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just ridiculous and the turps on it
were just insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of those ones, like I said,
if you're at a party and you roll a joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: you pass it round and as it goes round,
you see people toke on the joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the joint and then look around the
circle to ask someone, what the fuck is
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's literally hitting them with
so much flavour that it's just coating
[SPEAKER_00]: their mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the goal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: The background of Casey Jones is Orient
Express, which is Billy Goat's Bangkok
[SPEAKER_00]: Betty, a chocolate tie, cross train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that was crossed with Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So completely unique things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no familiarity in any of those
flavours to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the palate of like a UK smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were some other cuts of Casey
Jones that went around.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like the Schmo cut, but yours
was considered the best for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what did you think of the others?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever get to try them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what's funny?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had two cuts myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a Typhino as well that was
incredible, but I let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I was then still at the mindset
of like, oh, I can't have two Casey Jones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I'm trying to only really
keep six mothers or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always loved the like mindset of
like a new one's got to come in and knock
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually I have to whittle down my
selection so that I have one of each
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was naive to the reality of two of the
same strain being unique enough to warrant
[SPEAKER_00]: both being kept.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can certainly feel myself being
guilty of that one as well at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regrets, bro, regrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The strain was passed out and I smoked it
a couple of years later and it was given
[SPEAKER_00]: to me as something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had mixed it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were calling it the mass sour because
we had a Massachusetts super skunk cross
[SPEAKER_00]: sour bubble and they gave me the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they gave it to me, I goes,
this is the Casey Jones cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even need to smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I goes, that's not mass sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Casey Jones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the guys wouldn't believe me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my cuts, both of them, but they
wouldn't believe me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, full circle, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So were you breeding at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what, bro?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to become the best possible
grower I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I held breeders in such high regard
that breeding wasn't even on my radar
[SPEAKER_00]: until it was until I was asked to do a
project for someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of breeding is like I had friends
around me that were like growing hobby
[SPEAKER_00]: growers like myself, like my friend,
Dr. D online.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, I would grow out his seeds and he'd do
little hobby breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even at that stage for me,
I was like, I knew that there was,
[SPEAKER_00]: there were levels that I hadn't reached as
a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of breeding was like to me a slap
in the face of people that were doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I thought you had to, I thought
you should get to a certain like master
[SPEAKER_00]: your craft, in one regard before you try
and get to a next stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't until I competed in the icy
mad cup, I saw that my bud was on the
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Mrs. Grateful, Grateful Head's wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was in the UK and I got to spend some
time with her and she got to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she told me like, Barry, you're true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your stuff is on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're on the level of all of us in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is the truth of it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best growers in the world are a nine
out of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, there's no tens because we all
know that for every single minute of every
[SPEAKER_00]: single day of an entire crop to go
perfectly doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually it will get to that point
because technology and room setups and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow techniques are evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the moment it's not at that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how I feel is that the best grower in
the world on a day to day is an eight out
[SPEAKER_00]: of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Occasionally when you hit a nine,
that's when you say to your peers,
[SPEAKER_00]: check this one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I will like bother saying
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll maybe have 30 jars sometimes and
offer them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, yeah, I've got this,
I've got this, I've got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there'll be one that I know peaked.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that really stood out and is on that
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, ironically enough that span of
this last year I grew a cheese plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: was that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, Oh, this is as good as I've
ever grown a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For whatever reason, this one had the
right root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was healthy, happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light was correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people was, we're going crazy about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had people, people were just
shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, fucking hell Brian,
that cheese like this ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people were like really, really
excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of those ones that I knew
it was the one I was saying to people
[SPEAKER_00]: like, look, these are all my things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even though these are all my
creations, this fucking cheese just came
[SPEAKER_00]: out crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is it really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I realized, like once I realized I
was in that realm of being able to attain
[SPEAKER_00]: eights and nines occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when you kind of, I was willing to
take on the concept of doing some
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to, we're going to lose our
linearity in time for a moment and fast
[SPEAKER_01]: forward for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard from a few various sources that
you frequently have the best flower at
[SPEAKER_01]: Spannibus most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you feel is the kind of state
of affairs with the flower at Spannibus in
[SPEAKER_01]: general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also there's Terps Army Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to mention them because there's a
couple, a UK girl and I think her
[SPEAKER_00]: boyfriend's Italian.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called Terps Army Farm on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I have to shout them out
because I have a massive amount of respect
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow on that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're people that I would say are on the
elite level of like, yeah, they're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: eights and nines consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really put in the work and they
really have a love and a passion for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I big myself up, I definitely
got to give them a shout out because I
[SPEAKER_00]: love what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other people that have got
some amazing buds, but like I always plan
[SPEAKER_00]: for Spannibus especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like from, from always, if there's an
event, nothing pleases me more than being
[SPEAKER_00]: there in my element around my peers and
people that wait and then when you show
[SPEAKER_00]: them things, they appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go above and beyond and out of my way
to try and make sure that I've perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed everything down to the timing so
that the flowers haven't been cured for
[SPEAKER_00]: too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not too fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try and get everything right and really
just flush everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like my genetics I believe in and I
know that if I flush everything right and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's clean, then that makes it stand out
because I know there's a lot of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, white ash is a myth and all of these
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I'm no scientist, but I know
the whiter the ashes, the more I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to talk for anyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying I haven't had things that
don't burn a little bit gray that weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: nice, but whiter ash is a smoother,
cleaner, more enjoyable smoke for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those results are shown by the
feedback that I get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice that anyone that's ever
talking about my bud in a good regard,
[SPEAKER_00]: is just often talking about the flush and
how clean it smokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go back in time now and go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about the first cross you ever
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it intentional or was it an accident?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first cross I ever made, I lost a
project before I ever got to harvest the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what got me on the path of
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing a project for someone else,
for a res dog from Reservoir C.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will have people like, that'll get
people super like, I've triggered a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of people now, but it's like, don't worry
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned he was a fucking scumbag too,
just like everyone else, but it's part of
[SPEAKER_00]: my history nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I was actually doing a project I
was doing a Chem Dog IBL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had started doing that project for
Res because he knew that I knew the Chem
[SPEAKER_00]: D.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had got a lot of familiarity with that
cutting by being around it a lot on the
[SPEAKER_00]: East coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when he actually asked me to do a
project, it was the Chem IBL because I
[SPEAKER_00]: realized two reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, I was feeling familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two, because it was the IBL,
he realized that he could ask me to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: project without having to give me the cut
because it was just crossing the seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing and doing an IBL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inbred line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't need to actually use the
cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just wanted me to select multiple males
and hit the best females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did a lot of interesting stuff where
he'd like, you know, BX it then F2 it or
[SPEAKER_01]: F3 it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he explain to you his rationale behind
that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a fan of Mr. Souls and the
Cinderella 99 and the back crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was his thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it, as people will tell you,
there were versions that were good.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were ones that were bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were ups and downs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it he did himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it he farmed out to other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often it was farmed out to friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who fucked it up and the seed still went
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were bad batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was all, there was always crazy
stuff like that going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last batch of Sal diesel IBL wasn't
made by him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was made by basically connoisseur
genetics who just used two clones that
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't even given to him by res dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two Sal diesel clones sourced
by someone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just easier for res to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was so burnt by getting the scammed for
the East coast South.
[SPEAKER_00]: A diesel cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who remembers IC mag will remember
the friendly friend fiasco where someone
[SPEAKER_00]: came.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that was their name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friendly friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if someone's professing
themselves to be called friendly friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, you're pushing it a bit too
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: This friendliness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have been suspicious with the
name, but he ended up getting the East
[SPEAKER_00]: coast, sour diesel cut off res and
starting his own line where he used that
[SPEAKER_00]: cup or called it Indonesian diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was this big drama on IC mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after that res dog, like didn't want
to give out the cut ever because you,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you know the forum world back then cuts
were so guarded that once it was out and
[SPEAKER_00]: people had it, they were using it,
breeding it, trading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was a crazy world for cuts back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to earn your stripes to get a cut
in things have changed so much these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, back in the day,
it was like, it was a sign of respect to
[SPEAKER_00]: know that you had like certain cuts
because you had done something to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: that point where someone offered you a
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't go out asking for cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would earn your stripes by putting in
the work and then the right people would
[SPEAKER_00]: see what you were doing and offer you the
right things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the question that I want to ask
is how did you lose the project?
[SPEAKER_00]: As you said, basically being in a
prohibition state, like the UK where I
[SPEAKER_00]: used to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: The house got robbed for the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is, it's like the way things always
work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I say, loose lips, sink ships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened is that the business
partner who arranged the property had a
[SPEAKER_00]: best friend and that best friend robbed us
because sadly with prohibition and the way
[SPEAKER_00]: things are, it brings a lot of negative
attention from the wrong types of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people will get into their heads that
they can justify doing those kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden you lose a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, it was a sad thing to lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I had two rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was the seed project and one was the
flower project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, to lose the seeds was more
heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you're fucking idiots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've stolen a bunch of seeds that are
worthless to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and now I've lost everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was, that was the first loss I
ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the first time I ever did
anything with anyone other than myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happened after that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just start working with Rez?
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, by that stage, I then stopped
working with Rez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rez was doing all kinds of weird shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He basically blocked a mutual friend from
giving me the East Coast sour diesel car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some super sly moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had like just generally started to
show his true colors and reveal himself
[SPEAKER_00]: not to be like, this is the thing with
Rez.
[SPEAKER_00]: His perception online was a scumbag piece
of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to come across so rude and
abrasive that he wasn't likable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clashed with him online.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason I ever got to know him is
because I was friends with Grateful Head
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mrs. Grateful, the creators of Casey
Jones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was friends with them and they in turn
were friends with Rezdog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess they just had a better
relationship with him than most,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I met him, by going to
America to visit them and then in turn
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to be in those circles and be
around him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then over a period of time, he just turned
out to be a fucking major, major piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: shit in Rezdog.
[SPEAKER_00]: In real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as with a lot of people who have like
a certain degree of intelligence,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're able to say the right things at
the right time to people, tune into their
[SPEAKER_00]: frequency and use them to their own ends
and gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the kind of person he turned out
to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, I was kind of lucky that
when they had a whole bunch of drama and
[SPEAKER_00]: all got busted, I was in prison myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't visiting America, seeing them
at that time gladly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got busted with my partner at
Connoisseur Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically after the first Rezdog project,
I had all of my female selections from the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus I had all of my female selections
from just growing as a grower because I
[SPEAKER_00]: would have like, I had a variety of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had motor breath from Jimmy Nitz back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like 2008, 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had it before it had a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just crosses that he gave me when I
went and visited America because I met
[SPEAKER_00]: Jimmy Nitz in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's one of the best growers, most humble,
and he's the guy that changed my whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on Femini Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's San Fernando Valley reversal that he
done to train Rick and to the Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: To this day, my top 10 Femmes I've ever
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably motor breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Motor breath's in my probably top five
ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's interesting you say that
because I actually had the question I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you ever feel like motor breath is kind
of similar to the truth?
[SPEAKER_01]: On paper, they look like they've got a lot
of similar elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I've tried to get that same
Chem Turp is what I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're these joke shop fart gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That turp that people smell and go rot,
that smells like fart gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what Chem D smells like to me in
its essence.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the motor breath, you had like an OG
structure with that foul, rotten Chem D
[SPEAKER_00]: stank.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like in the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does come through in the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a turp that I love and I've often
worked towards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you consider the truth to be kind of
your most well known strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Turpzilla as well is quite well
known.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was grown out by a good few
friends and got into some good growers
[SPEAKER_00]: hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won a few cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another one that's real well known
and hyped up that I've had that for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's made it more well known as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact it hasn't been released,
it's just been grown and people have got
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke it and it's picked up a few cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting you mentioned the
Turpzilla because that one uses the
[SPEAKER_01]: Turparella and that one caught my eye
because it's got that chocolate tie in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, where did that come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that maybe plays a role in
why Turpzilla, even though a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: distant relative, why it does kind of
shine through as one of your more well
[SPEAKER_01]: known crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're maybe getting them mixed
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it should have said chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, I'll be honest with you,
that strain there is a Femseed that an IC
[SPEAKER_00]: mag member made.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started True Canto Genetics,
I'll be honest, I don't like making
[SPEAKER_00]: Femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I originally started True Canto
Genetics, I was under pressure to release
[SPEAKER_00]: some Femseeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my friends had made the chocolate
Cross Super Silver Haze, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: Turparella.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had those seeds and I just said to him,
look bro, I'll release those through True
[SPEAKER_00]: Canto Genetics because I need to sell some
Femseeds because the market is just going
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy for them at the moment and I don't
want to make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to focus on regular breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one isn't even made by me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one and only time a strain or
anything has ever been released by me that
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't made by me myself, the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to get that out there because
it's not something I try and hide and
[SPEAKER_00]: generally it's not something I would ever
do, but that one isn't made by me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard other breeders talk about
doing similar things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about how the truth is one of
your more well-known strains, but let's
[SPEAKER_01]: put that in contrast to what do you feel
is your best strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's something which flies under
the radar a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your personal favourite?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real king strain for me, is my Chem
Valley Cooks, but I've not released it
[SPEAKER_00]: because my whole philosophy behind that is
that when I got the Forum cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it from an ICMAG member called
Crunch Bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got it with the crew that he's with in
San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another grower called Abba Roots whose
seed company is called Always Be
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering, I think it is, and they passed
us the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came out of prison in 2009,
2011, they sent me the Forum Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies and that was a groundbreaking
strain, but when I bred with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that I get no pride from breeding
something that just tastes like cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'd done is when I created Chem
Valley Cooks and crossed it with an SFV
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem Dog male, I never wanted to release
that because really it was very cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant, the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to do was search for a male
that when I bred with that male,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gave all of the bag appeal and
favourable traits of the cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but allowed me to impart all of the
flavour from the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I love the Chem Valley Cooks
because it's allowed me as a breeding tool
[SPEAKER_00]: to release a variety of strains now that
are giving me the profiles that I want,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the bag appeal that the modern market
is obsessed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one at the moment called Crimson
Cookies and another one called Cheminade.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cheminade everyone's loving at the
moment and that's a Grape Lemonade crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Chem Valley Cooks and Grape
Lemonade is a Lemon Larry OG cross Chem
[SPEAKER_00]: Dog cross Granddaddy Purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: When could we expect possibly be able to
get those for ourselves?
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's available at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cheminade is available in regular
seeds now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my seeds come in packs of 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I do that is because you know
what, I'm obsessed with like as a grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always wanted to be able to have my
selection and then keep a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the average grower, I'm confident
that from a pack of 15 seeds, you can pop
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 seeds, find at least one amazing keeper
and then have five seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if ever anything happens, you've got
five seeds from that original pack because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's something in growers heads that no
matter what, if they've had a keeper from
[SPEAKER_00]: a pack of seeds and they lose it,
even if it's the same seed, just like
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, same parents, they really have an
affinity for that pack of seeds that it
[SPEAKER_00]: came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they've got a few left over that
they can go back to, they've got like,
[SPEAKER_00]: they feel more happy that they've got
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of feel like 15 seeds in a pack
is a nice number for a grower to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And give them a little backup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that applied psychology and
breeding and marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: A new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just want to go back to a minute
because I was actually talking to our
[SPEAKER_01]: buddies from Always Be Flowering just
earlier today, in fact, and he mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned I was going to be chatting
with you and he actually basically kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: relayed similar information to what you
just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I wanted to ask was, he said,
you know, you were one of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: people, if not, you know, the first person
in the UK to get the forum cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that change the scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened at that point when you got
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Without any shadow of a doubt,
we were the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cuts were sent to me and immediately
shared with my business partner at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, OJD of Connoisseur Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who I was working with at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got those cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't believe how they got to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally, we come out of prison,
got messaged by my buddy Crunch Bubble,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he said that, look, man, we love you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got something special for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to send you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he FedExed me cuts and they were there
within three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had six rooted cuts of the Girl Scout
cookies and six unrooted cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all rooted and all of a sudden we had
the most insane, mind blowing strain we
[SPEAKER_00]: had seen in fucking years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a game changer, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It literally like people in London in
2011, 2012 were paying £10,000 a kilo for
[SPEAKER_00]: Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: £10 a gram all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a kilo?
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs £10 a gram for a kilo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was people were buying that
happily, doubling their money and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: selling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were like going home, raiding their
bank, fucking looking down the sofa.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like, okay, I'll get £10,000 and
I'll get 10, 20 draws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people were just going crazy for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a game changer, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that level where every now and again,
a turp profile, a look, something comes
[SPEAKER_00]: along.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like at one point it was purple
bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was so rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the Blackberry cut that was on
Overgrow popped up, it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: my God, purple bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and that's how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: When new buds come along, they're just
game changers and cookies did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that got it, were going wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so were you breeding at that point or
were you looking to get back into it after
[SPEAKER_01]: your little steal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were breeding at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the truth of it is that at
Connoisseur Genetics, when we were making
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, OJD was making seeds, I was making
seeds and OJD had another friend who was
[SPEAKER_00]: making a lot of seeds for us too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we were locked up, we were still
having seeds produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were never stopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and OJ, we're no longer friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things happen, perspective, different
views, such as life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we went through some adventures and
when we got locked up and we're in prison
[SPEAKER_00]: for trying to win a high times and getting
busted, we sat in prison, made strain
[SPEAKER_00]: names up, made phone calls, relayed that
info, had our work still released and
[SPEAKER_00]: lived on in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a point of teaching at least five
people how to grow when I was in prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you think you'll stop me,
but you will multiply me because I will
[SPEAKER_00]: teach as many people as possible how easy
it is and what a wonderful life you can
[SPEAKER_00]: have from growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I made a point of doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue to run the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned Photoshop and use it in my
business to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I made the most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you won't stop me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use it against the system and I will
use it for my cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at what point did you diverge and start
your own company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, after we came out of prison,
me and OJ tried to work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as with a lot of people that do
business together, business and friendship
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got to the point where I walked away
from connoisseur genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been around 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: End of 2011 or maybe early 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's when I started true kind
of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like in order, like when I walked
away, I wanted to try and salvage a
[SPEAKER_00]: friendship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like my original release is for true
kind of genetics rather than do anything
[SPEAKER_00]: with anything that we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I released a couple of FEM things that I
had done that he hadn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of unique, like Tertzilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally did get released in limited
packs on ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few packs went out and was sold,
but it was small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the purple halitosis,
the grape lemonade, and a few other FEM
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I released those for true kind of genetics
originally, but they were small batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it actually came to full
distribution, I started with fresh pallet
[SPEAKER_00]: and I went for regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always wanted to try and stay on
that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did is because I'd become such a
fan, of the ChemDog profile, and from
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the ChemDog IBL and the ChemDog
back cross work that I'd done with
[SPEAKER_00]: Connoisseur genetics, I got some SFV cross
ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is what I used as a male to hit
up a few different things to start the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation of true kind of genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the original strains was Chem
Valley Cooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the Truth Sagan star, which was a
Sensi star cross, and then Broadleaf
[SPEAKER_00]: Black, which was a Black Domina cross,
or Black Domina.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never know how that one's pronounced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you said it right one of the two
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know which one either,
but it's interesting you bring that up
[SPEAKER_01]: because I wanted to talk to you about
that, specifically the SFV ChemDog
[SPEAKER_01]: component.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that one of the various SFV IBLs
crossed to the ChemDog?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how did the genetics work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because on face value, it sounds like two
clone-onlys, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering where the male part is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is ResDog's ChemD back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the back cross to the second back
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: A male from that was hit to the San
Fernando Valley OG Kushka.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you put that in context,
it then actually kind of makes me feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Chem Valley Cooks is kind of
like, it's not all that different from a
[SPEAKER_01]: GMO thing in a way, you know, like it's
got the similar components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the GMO kills me because it's like,
I love that it's taken this long for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone to fall in love with the ChemD
Terp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it had to look like cookies for
the modern generation to fall in love with
[SPEAKER_00]: it because that's what the Terp is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is straight ChemD Terps, but it's
just got all the bag of pill that everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: goes wild for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's like, that is a good look
and it's a beautiful Terp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would you compare the Chem Valley
Cookies to something like the GMO or one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the various other ChemDog Girl Scout
hybrids like Chem Scout or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the GMO, like most notably has that
horrendously long flowering time,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does the Chem Valley Cookies compare
to those ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what it is, yeah, to really get that
Terp from the ChemD, I've crossed the Chem
[SPEAKER_00]: Valley Cooks with the Truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then what you're getting, is you're
getting the SFE Chem from both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one I've called True Dough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one has got the ChemTerp to
perfection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that wicked fart gas stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one finishes at like eight,
nine weeks, 10 if you really want to push
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one's got all of the bag of pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got low leaf to bud ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like super, super dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got super, super high resin
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, I've been pressing rosin on
my Sasquatch and my God, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I showed my friend yesterday and I love it
because it was one of those times when you
[SPEAKER_00]: let them smell it and they tell you the
thing that it smells of before you give
[SPEAKER_00]: them any hints.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said straight away, that smells
like fart gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, he goes, not in a bad way,
but do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, I do know what you
mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what I wanted you to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact you said it just put a big smile
on my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I reckon it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Chem Valley Cooks itself,
that one, the flowers, the one that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: selected as a keeper, I've kind of gone
away from the ChemTerp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone for like a sweeter, more floral,
doughy kind of terp for the actual Chem
[SPEAKER_00]: Valley Cooks itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one I'm testing at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the set like an increase across
of that and I'm waiting to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had an opportunity to grow them
out, but I've not been rushed to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem Valley Cooks out as a strain itself,
because like I said, for me, it was more
[SPEAKER_00]: about selecting a male to use as a
breeding tool than releasing the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're trying to continue on the
story, so to speak, at what point did you
[SPEAKER_01]: decide at what point did you decide to
leave the UK and head over to Spain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: After originally getting busted,
going to the high times and going to
[SPEAKER_00]: prison, I decided to send Bud to
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it got there, I just wasn't happy
with how it was after having sent it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I literally decided to myself,
the only way I'm ever going to win a high
[SPEAKER_00]: times is if I am in a city, grow the
fucking Bud out, put it into Tupperware,
[SPEAKER_00]: walk up to the people and hand it over
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I need to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I decided, yeah, that's what I'm going
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tied in with that as well at the time,
a crazy, a fucked up thing happened is
[SPEAKER_00]: that my girlfriend at the time came to
visit me from America, got refused entry
[SPEAKER_00]: into the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up just saying to her like,
look, move to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm going there to grow now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, it was only a matter of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to fucking, do a high times in
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, it was kind of perfect
timing for me to leave England and go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam and be in the city and win a
high times, which from being a kid before
[SPEAKER_00]: even growing, seeing the high times and
the high times carpet was always so
[SPEAKER_00]: prestigious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, a lot of people want to
criticize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I could probably talk some shit
about high times too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, yeah,
proof is in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that someone like me could
place and win in the high times,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that someone like lady sativa
genetics can win the fact that someone
[SPEAKER_00]: like karma genetics can win all those
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the fact that Fino find is the
fact that all these people can win is
[SPEAKER_00]: proof that smaller people can win these
cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not all about who does the big
sponsorship, who does this, who does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like for me to win a second place
high times blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the reality is that the small
guys, when they go to the high times,
[SPEAKER_00]: your first place is third place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You expect the big boys to sweep one and
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the up and coming little guy
who's making a name and putting in some
[SPEAKER_00]: work might snag a third place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then five other guys equally deserving
are going to lose out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I stood there and they said
second, like they said, the third place,
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at my cousin and said,
Oh well, it's been fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they said second place winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, and it shows that like putting
in work and fucking dedicating yourself to
[SPEAKER_00]: something can, can pay off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're in Amsterdam and you'd won
second place.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point then did you travel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where'd you go at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam was such a crazy adventure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone that's ever lived in Amsterdam
knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most like you can, you can walk
around smoke and go to coffee shops,
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trying to grow there is so fucking
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is mind bending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you will literally move into a place
and the neighbor will come and knock on
[SPEAKER_00]: your door and ask you who you are and what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As if that's just a cool thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they want to know and they are onto
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I originally went there,
I had a huge grow with a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grow got robbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before, before I ever even got a
harvest out of it, it got robbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was left in a situation where I
literally had to throw two 400 watt lamps
[SPEAKER_00]: into a room in my apartment, pop four
packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to grow the seeds out for eight
weeks, harvest at eight weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: dry for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had one week to trim and hand
into the high times and I literally for my
[SPEAKER_00]: high times entry, I entered a whole plant,
including the tiny little like 0.3 gram
[SPEAKER_00]: nuggets and everything, because it was
just a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to enter it without smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to choose what plants I was
going to end up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gee whiz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what, sorry, what plant was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I entered like, I entered The Truth that
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I entered, I think maybe we entered Ken
Valley Cooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We entered a few different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sorry, that's my dehumidifier going
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I entered a few different things,
but The Truth is the one that won second
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I literally had to, like I said,
I had to just choose the plants and enter
[SPEAKER_00]: them because each plant, because I only
had like a couple of weeks to veg and had
[SPEAKER_00]: to do everything in such a small space of
time because of losing the other grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have big enough plants to even
really do selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to kind of eye it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was going to say, the truth is,
and it's ironic that I say that,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that I knew from week five the winning
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my friend that I was living with at
the time who runs an extraction company
[SPEAKER_00]: called Yellow Brick Labs, we knew like
when I showed him like, smell this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was like, yeah, he just confirmed to
me, you know, when you know the standout
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, he just gave me the nods just to
say, yeah, that's fucking abrasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just had such a beautiful, aggressive
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the one that I knew was
special and that was the one that got me
[SPEAKER_00]: the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very special place in my heart,
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long did you continue to hang out
in Amsterdam for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, like I said, it was so difficult to
live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was so difficult to do and it
was so expensive that I won a high times
[SPEAKER_00]: in November.
[SPEAKER_00]: In December, I went to Morocco to like a
beautiful farm over there to like do some
[SPEAKER_00]: like some research for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically wanted me to find out what
was left on the material after they had
[SPEAKER_00]: done four grades of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: After it had been hit four times and
they'd got everything off of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: was there anything left on the material?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because imagine if you've got five ton of
material and there's resin left on it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you throw it away, what's the potential?
[SPEAKER_01]: Little bit of chemilites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was incredible to go there and find
out that one of the strains had four
[SPEAKER_00]: percent return and another one had seven
percent return with just a crude,
[SPEAKER_00]: simple, like open blasted, like BHO
extraction just to get numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as distillate, somewhere like
Morocco just has fucking incredible,
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So was it then you transitioned over to
Spain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my plan was always to go to Spain
after I won a high time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that, it was a couple of trips to
Barcelona to settle things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I moved there in the early part
of 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Barcelona, the cannabis social club
scene had always appealed to me before I
[SPEAKER_00]: even moved to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had said to friends like, yeah,
eventually Spain and Barcelona with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis social club scene is going to be
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once a bunch of friends were living
there and I'd met loads of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: were over here with clubs and doing
things, the opportunity was here to come
[SPEAKER_00]: over and people kind of invited me to work
and a lot of opportunities opened up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is the European scene kind of the
Mecca that it's made out to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially Spain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Barcelona is the epicenter of the European
cannabis industry by far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taken over Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the place where people come on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as a kid, like from the age of
15 onwards, I was going to Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most English people, it's a 15 minute
flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It costs less than a hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fly to Amsterdam for a day if you
want, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people, I know people that have
been 50 times in their lifetime to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam because they do, they view it
like a weekend away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can spend more money getting
taxis around London than what you do if
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a last minute flight over to
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people would do that so regular,
but as Amsterdam has tried to push out the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis culture and kind of fancied the
whole place up, it's kind of given the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity for Barcelona to have a
thriving social club scene and to start to
[SPEAKER_00]: draw all of those same people over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a variety of different like
airlines with the seasons that are quiet,
[SPEAKER_00]: mild over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got friends that nobody I know
who's been here once has only been here
[SPEAKER_00]: once.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all come back many times and often
two or three times a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a little ad for it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the Barcelona scene like in your
opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in the heyday currently or is the
best yet to come?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible to be in a place where
people have the opportunity to make
[SPEAKER_00]: something of themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like to be at the start of any
industry where people with passion are
[SPEAKER_00]: able to put in the work, find their niche,
fine tune it, and then put it out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: world and build a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing to see from all the different
social clubs that have a variety of styles
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that no matter what kind of person you
are, you can find somewhere that suits
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A vibe that has your kind of people,
whether it's one up, which is like full of
[SPEAKER_00]: retro computer games with an amazing menu,
with a cereal bar, with like 50 different
[SPEAKER_00]: breakfast cereals, all the American fancy
fruit loops with marshmallows and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that incredible place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's Tresor, which is like the
most insane artwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got like already like 20 plus pieces
of art from some of the world's most
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible street artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's places like La Collada,
which has got the most amazing murials and
[SPEAKER_00]: like a real laid back vibe with like lots
of in-house work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with Wee Flowers, where they do a lot
of their own growing, extracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alma Social Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many good ones and there's
something for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there's places like The Plug for
the like younger guys that like the trap
[SPEAKER_00]: music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like all the hype strains and all the
like super like latest, greatest,
[SPEAKER_00]: cali this and skittles that and all of
those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, it's an incredible place
with the clubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're starting to get shops are
popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're getting like real
high-end head shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a place called Head Stash
Barcelona that now have anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: touches in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glow Trays, the Puff Co Peek attachments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go there and get all your
backward clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I'm pushing 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to buy backwards clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even smoke backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know what these 20 year olds are
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like to be able to get all of
this stuff that's in America that
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's seeing on Instagram to now be
able to get it in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get people from England flying over
just to get the latest, greatest stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: from this shop because they've got all the
like exclusives that you can't get
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's adding to the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the scene is like there's a new place
that's opened up called the Wake and
[SPEAKER_00]: Bakery, which is like a stoner friendly
food spot that's got loads of baked goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just stoner guys that have
opened a place and they've used the old
[SPEAKER_00]: name Wake and Bakery, which is an awesome
one because I knew a place on the East
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast called the Wake and Bakery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So slowly you're getting things with the
Cannabis Museum that Sensei have got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've got other things starting
to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that on top of the social club scene,
you've got other things for people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in that scene to come and see and do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's adding to the culture massively
out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an awesome description of it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing I wanted to touch on,
which you yourself referenced,
[SPEAKER_01]: the hype game.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a part of the American scene,
which I don't really enjoy that much
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of referenced it, but I'll
outright ask it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has it infected the Barcelona scene and
are the plug kind of like the equivalent
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Jungle Boys of Barcelona?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plug's just like incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, he's built the most incredible
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what he's done there, people try to
replicate and anyone that tries to
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate it, they fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came and done the perfect spot for
people who are interested in the latest,
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest things, the latest kind of like
music, like the UK scenes putting out,
[SPEAKER_00]: the American crossover.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a record label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got all the like best music
playing for that age group and that genre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not my style of place,
but it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he does is he not only has all
the latest, greatest strains from Cali,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he also has loads of stuff growing
locally as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does source out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good local stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he has everything across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a lot of people want to hate on
whoever's doing really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the modern day mentality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably been in the way since day
one, since existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what he's got there is an incredible
place, but it's not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I said Barcelona's incredible,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you like guitar music and
acoustic stuff, you'll find a club that's
[SPEAKER_00]: got three guitars set in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like the latest, greatest grime
music, trap music, the latest strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: have just dropped, then there's somewhere
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like art, there's somewhere for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like computer games, there's
somewhere for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the plug, like they are killing
the hype game, but they're doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: properly and they are getting the best
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the connections to get the
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What annoys me is some of the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the other spots that are just like
trying to be that, but they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: shit Calibud and trying to charge through
the nose for it and promoting that
[SPEAKER_00]: massively and trying to convince the world
that Calibud's better because their markup
[SPEAKER_00]: and profit margin on that Calibud is
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the problems are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problems aren't places that are trying
to get the best thing for people to try
[SPEAKER_00]: the latest, greatest things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is places that are getting
subpar bud that are pricing it crazy and
[SPEAKER_00]: then all the staff push that over local
grown stuff to people who don't know any
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is rife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hype game with that regard is kind
of fucking bad in Barcelona because unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to clubs where there's educated
staff who can educate people about the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower and the genetics, they just sell
the latest, greatest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the same everywhere I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to touch on something you
mentioned there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said that there is a variety of
different things on offer depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: where you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to talk about some kind of
Spain specific clone onlys and your
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one I most want to ask you about
is a plan I've always had on my mind
[SPEAKER_01]: forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever smoked that clone only of
Queen Mother that goes around Spain?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the background on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's from the delicatessen crew who are
kind of like friends with kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: biogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a cross of like a reunion island
with like this Congo hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So real raw, sativary land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: But apparently there's this specific cut
that goes around Spain of it that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: meant to be insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a cut that's a Congo one
called Lily or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the name of the cut, Lily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the only standout things I've
ever smoked in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first came here in 2015,
I think I was given that in La Colada and
[SPEAKER_00]: Wee Flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both have that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was gifted in La Colada and it
was the best example I've smelled of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a beautiful profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Congolese, is this really a
Congolese?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, fuck, this is so tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one which doesn't get talked about
a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, on that point, what's going on
with ACE and Canna Biogen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any contact with those guys at
all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel like they've kind of fallen
off a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: To date, was there like fallings out
between them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there some craziness where ACE was
meant to have taken the genetics of Canna
[SPEAKER_00]: Biogen and they split up or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, yeah, there's some kind of
like conflict I heard from someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just noticed that both of them have
seemingly stopped putting out new
[SPEAKER_01]: releases, whereas they were on a bit of a
good run for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what I got told, I'll
speculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is total speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what someone told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone basically told me that Canna
Biogen was the one who was really doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the work and that ACE kind of half jacked
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the story I heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that's true or not, it would
explain why they both stopped doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: because if one guy didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they can't jack it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's all gone and he can't make them
again because he jacked them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or whatever, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's a strange one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it's totally possible in the
sense that Charlie Garcia is well known
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Canna Biogen crew as being a
legit breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would make sense that they're the
ones doing the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, you know, maybe we'll find out
the answer to that one another day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there anyone doing anything over
there that's kind of really innovating in
[SPEAKER_01]: your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few crews out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a lot of hash making crews.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain is a hash making culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of the hash making culture,
there's incredible thing people do and
[SPEAKER_00]: like amazing work out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got like Eminem extracts, La Sagrada
Familia extracts, the guys from Wee
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers, Alma Social Club, La Collada,
Nerd Extracts who has a one up club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you've got a UK guy called... His
name will come to me in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having a brain freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's loads of good people
over here, bro, doing loads of good work
[SPEAKER_00]: and building brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a grower called Nectar Monkey that
I know that does like live soil and like
[SPEAKER_00]: he really puts in the work to like put out
an incredible high end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a lot of people that will like
do everything in house where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing things, they're pressing stuff
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got rosin, they've got flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a friend that does edibles as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So him and his girlfriend, he grows,
she makes edibles that they sell to the
[SPEAKER_00]: club.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they're called fresh flower farm
and fresh flower edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, that's the kind of thing I
mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like, they came here from England
and were able to build a life for
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves by taking some risks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting in a bit of work, persevering,
going through some ups and downs,
[SPEAKER_00]: but having a goal and a dream and wanting
to come and do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Barcelona allows you to like find your
niche and find your spot and like build
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lots of people doing cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another one I have to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers with attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are doing incredible stuff over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to those guys for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the next question that jumps to
mind based off that is, how hard is it
[SPEAKER_01]: realistically for someone to pack their
bags and move over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a little bit of a rundown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it feasible or is it quite easy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you've got to have enough money
to set yourself up for six months,
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it boils down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you've got to be able to come
over here and afford to lay down deposits
[SPEAKER_00]: and rent on a house for the first six
months so that you can find a house,
[SPEAKER_00]: move in, set yourself up, get a crop down,
and then the ball's rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyone who can set themselves into a
position to do that and can get it right,
[SPEAKER_00]: can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to find the right house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to make sure that you can rent
that house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to make sure that you've got
the documentation and the bank account,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can show someone that you're
self-employed, that you're a computer
[SPEAKER_00]: programmer, artist, designer, and that you
work online and set yourself up and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you're in a house,
you can set yourself up and be a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not that easy, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's easy if you can make it
happen, but it's not just pack your bags,
[SPEAKER_00]: turn up, and it all falls into place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of planning and a lot of
fucking determination and a bit of cash as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's not cheap to, you know
what it's like with anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pay one month to the agent,
maybe a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a deposit and then really you need
to have your first three or four months
[SPEAKER_00]: rent ready to be paid so that you can get
a crop out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty sound advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electricity is always an issue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The houses are wired so bad that most of
them are limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can barely run any electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to find a house where you
can actually run enough electricity to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of factors like that,
where it's like, once you're here,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a wonderful sense of privacy and
your house is your castle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone minds their own business and a
lot of people grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbors grow, they go into their grow
room, when they open the door,
[SPEAKER_00]: it opens out into their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't do it discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lights up the hill that we live on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live on like a mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lights it up that at least six houses
down the hill know these guys are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had 20, like 15, 20 foot plants in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, they harvested the whole thing
in their back garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, they don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got other neighbors that have got
plants in their front garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, people mind their own
business out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't, if you're not showing off,
if you're not a flash fucker who's driving
[SPEAKER_00]: a fancy car around working class people,
stinking a weed all the time and making a
[SPEAKER_00]: noise, you're going to be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people I know that come out
here and live well, it's like the guys at
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps army farm and fresh flowers farm,
days guys, peaceful people, not flash
[SPEAKER_00]: people have come out here, set themselves
up well and keep themselves and themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: are polite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't be too in to the locals
because you don't want to get into too
[SPEAKER_00]: many conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I tell people I've got a
t-shirt company because I have a t-shirt
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, so that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can run my t-shirt company from Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go to the post office to send my
t-shirts all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very private, but it's not like I've
seen a lot of people think because they
[SPEAKER_00]: see a lot of people like myself over here
doing it well, that people just think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to come over and do it's like,
but everyone has to realize what I put on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram is what I want the world to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my business fucking page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you'll get a little bit of who I am,
but I can't tell you every up and down and
[SPEAKER_00]: trials and tribulations I'm going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people ask me, I will always
encourage them, but I'll give them a heads
[SPEAKER_00]: up and let them know like, look,
these are the pitfalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be aware of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, this is what you need to do,
but it is possible if you have a real
[SPEAKER_00]: passion for growing and you really see
yourself wanting to do it and take that
[SPEAKER_00]: risk and come and live somewhere because
there's always risks to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still in a prohibition state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are crazy in Barcelona at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Spanish police are beating the fuck
out of protesters and yeah, it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: volatile spot at the moment, but I love it
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's given me a wonderful life even
through the ups and downs that it
[SPEAKER_00]: provides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the scene over there, what's it like
with the growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they looking to pop new things and
find the next best thing or are they all
[SPEAKER_01]: just trying to get like the hype clones
from the States?
[SPEAKER_00]: It falls into the two categories,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't like, well, I'll make a,
I'll make a like, this is like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a dig.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like a digger people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know before I say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the people that can't grow quite
well enough to make and select something
[SPEAKER_00]: and make it shine and make it sell on that
merit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they need to go with hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strains to sell their bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are that level of grower
who grow so well and have so much passion
[SPEAKER_00]: that what they want to do is select their
own thing because they're growing is able
[SPEAKER_00]: to make that shine as much as any elite
and they can get the same money as someone
[SPEAKER_00]: selling a skittles cut grown out or a
gelato cut grown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of people that are
like, no, do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do my own selection and find
something unique and grow it to that
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's probably evenly split.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are just jumping on the
hype and trying to get the latest,
[SPEAKER_00]: greatest cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always going to be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the time there's a lot of
sharing in Barcelona and you do see cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: passed around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of more like, I'd like to say
it's more on the positive side where
[SPEAKER_00]: people are hunting for keepers in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's happening a lot now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I've seen blowing up more and more in
the UK recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that because cuttings are
going to the worst growers, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like people who are like average growers
will buy cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, the elite growers
that used to get those cuts, because this
[SPEAKER_00]: is, let's be honest, this is how it used
to be in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were at a certain level of
growing, cuts would come your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I got to a certain level and I
got the cheese cut from Brightside who was
[SPEAKER_00]: an IC mag grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, that is because I had grown
to a certain level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you would never give that cut
out to someone who wasn't growing to a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain level because you want that cut's
reputation to be withheld.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, that was the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like elite cuts went to elite growers
and that's why they were elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: The minute they go to average growers,
they lose their shine and their reputation
[SPEAKER_00]: is ruined.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the UK is seeing that because all
of these hype cuts are being grown out by
average growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is then ruining the market and
they're realizing there's more longevity
[SPEAKER_00]: in finding something unique themselves and
building a brand so that people come back
[SPEAKER_00]: for that specific thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No truer words ever spoken.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to loop back to a point you just made
about how cuts are shared around in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to ask you, you've bred with a
plant called Nicole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the same Nicole that the DNA crew
got from that Spanish dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the plan?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the plant like either way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicole is the cut from Maramberos,
who's a Colombian guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a, he's a friend that gave me that
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the same one that DNA used to make
the, what is it they made with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kosher, no, Nicole Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made Nicole Kush with it by crossing
it to the Kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, what's, what's Nicole like
as a plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you think pairs well with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest with you, as a plant,
as flower form, I'm not a fan of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't like the way it smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unique thing about Nicole is the resin
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a type of resin that comes away
from the plant and is the most solid resin
[SPEAKER_00]: you can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make static sifts with it and to do
extracts and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes just ridiculously rigid extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an incredible hash making plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's become one of the
biggest hash making strains in Morocco is
[SPEAKER_00]: the Nicole Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they crossed it with the Kosher Kush,
it's kind of giving it a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: to it, added a bit more flavor and really
allowed the resin to just drop like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that they were making something
like four times the yield with the Nicole
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush from crops to like their own stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a crazy yield, just an incredible
hash made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I looked up the genetics on it and it's
largely just a mixture of kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: blue satellite and shishkeberry and a few
other blueberry type of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: MK Ultra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in the mix as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about the blueberry
flavors and does that shine through in
[SPEAKER_01]: that clone at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there is that blue, like it has
got that blueberry, like there is a hint
[SPEAKER_00]: to it that kind of stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the market, you know, like there's
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what really it smells like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of one of the great gardener
strains because that's also got the
[SPEAKER_00]: shishkeberry in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it's the shishkeberry turp
that kind of dominates because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled it also.
[SPEAKER_00]: What one is it from the great gardener?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what strain it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the Barbara Bud or one of those
ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Barbara Bud Afghani across
shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a familiar turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically whatever the shishkeberry is,
if you ever get a chance to smell
[SPEAKER_00]: something with the shishkeberry,
no, that's very similar to the Nicole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so while we're talking about flavors,
what is your favorite flavors in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the like, you know, real tropical
floral notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those, but I also like,
it sounds crazy, but I remember once a
[SPEAKER_00]: girl texting me and saying, can purple be
a flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, that's what I'm working
towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so kind of thing because she had
dabbed something combined and wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: know if purple was a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, that's the flavors that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love the purple flavors and
depending on how I breed with certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things, it reveals different kinds of
purple flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get all the like lavendery,
what I describe as like grandma's purse
[SPEAKER_00]: candy, you know, like old lady perfume,
incency, those kind of floral kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get all the grapey,
Merlot, wines, berries, dark fruits,
[SPEAKER_00]: those kind of purples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so many purple flavors that
come through depending on what direction
[SPEAKER_00]: you breed things in that I do love all
those different purple flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And broadly speaking, what type of highs
do you like the most?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like hugging a bud pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud that makes you feel like you're
just wrapped in a warm cozy blanket of
[SPEAKER_00]: wellness and well-being and like not
overly narcotic, but that nice little
[SPEAKER_00]: fuzzy feeling of wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the high I most go for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in the sativa lines I'm trying to
breed with, I'm trying to cut out the
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety, the heart racing, all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want a cerebral, like euphoric high that
kind of can allow you to relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I like that calm,
something with a calming effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think CBD being in things is
intricate to that and not being completely
[SPEAKER_00]: bred out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been thinking about that same kind of
thing myself for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be interested to know your
thoughts on this then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's a quality that you can
try to breed into a strain or do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: it just comes down to kind of like an
individual connection with a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: strain you might have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can breed towards it based on
your own experience and what's available
[SPEAKER_00]: to you to get from friends who you can get
to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because everyone is individual,
we do all need to find the perfect one for
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I think like it's about
selection and growing things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people grow things out,
grow them out three or four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make your selection off of the first
seed run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not every grows dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the second run plants are
completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a third's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, give them all a good try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try them at different flowering times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I think that's the real key
to get into that where I want to feel from
[SPEAKER_00]: my smoke is actually dialing in your
plants and doing the selection and looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for things that are kind of, that do
connect to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that you know, ah, these are the
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often the terpenes is the thing that
connects to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That entourage effect is like you get
people to connect to certain terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's obviously like there's certain
things they need to look towards and
[SPEAKER_00]: certain terp profiles is often what will
help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I wonder often if like lemon
sativas and lemon indicas will be good for
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain person that that particularly
connects to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, while we're talking about breeding
for a moment, a question our viewers
[SPEAKER_01]: always love.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of your tips for picking the
best male possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to a male, I never search
for males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wait for males to identify themselves as
the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I never like to think,
oh, this is the cross I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to select a male from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to wait for a male to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, often when you're growing out
plants, you have a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happened like, I remember probably
like before I started breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: it probably happened three times in like
five plus years where I had a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: was my favorite plant out of the pack that
I was the most excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it turns out to be a male and I'm
heartbroken because I'm not a breeder and
[SPEAKER_00]: I just chop it and I want females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the males that when they've got
everything about them that just stands out
[SPEAKER_00]: from the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, normally you will see a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has single branch and shit like side
branch in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spot a male like the females are
the ones that have all the candelabra,
[SPEAKER_00]: big wide side branch in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's normally obvious just from structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you do get a male that has the
perfect structure and then you touch it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it stinks, then you're onto something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's the start of this could be a
good male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I noticed on your Instagram,
you've got some photos of the Cam Valley
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies crossed Afghani and it immediately
made me wonder, where'd you get the
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghani from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what kind of traits did you look for
in that male?
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani is the craziest thing I've ever
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my greatest ever random discovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got contacted by someone who had a
friend that had come back from Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_00]: in the British army and had some seeds and
the guy offered them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he sent me these seeds and there was
like 37 seeds, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of 37 seeds, when they started,
they all look pretty uniform except for
[SPEAKER_00]: one that was growing with single blade
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like growing short and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to prop it up on a couple of pots to
get it up to the height of the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought to myself, let me mark that
one with a little star on the number so
[SPEAKER_00]: that I remember it was looking weird at
the beginning in case later on things grow
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turned out to be the most incredible
plant you could imagine, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the plants were all very
similar and had varying degrees of like
[SPEAKER_00]: whackness, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like no resin, no yield,
slightly nice smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit perfumey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one nice, maybe two nice ones that
were very similar in profile to all the
[SPEAKER_00]: bad ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So smell profile was across the board on
say 30 or 25 of them that were female was
[SPEAKER_00]: all across the board, very lemony floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one plant looks like an Oji Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me believe that Oji Kush is at
least 50% Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without any doubt in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you think could be the other
50%?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'll be honest with you, if I hadn't
heard the stories recently about what the
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses were, because there's like,
it's actually down now from that TK
[SPEAKER_00]: origins guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one of the strains that he says
is half of the genetics is a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm presuming that that's an Afghani
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my presumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is Afghani dominant because if
you see the pictures of the plant that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, bro, honestly, when I say about
it being a single blade leaf, it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like an Oji Kush cutting when it was
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually thought, oh, that's got a
bit of an Oji Kush look to the seed plant
[SPEAKER_00]: when it was a baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I don't doubt you at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bodhi and Doc D have got the Iranian,
which is like a dead ringer for cookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's it, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, it makes me believe it's so
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I guess time will tell with those
ones as to what they turn out to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do a bit of a throwback to
something you bred a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed in one of your posts you said
you also bred a grand doggy perp strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that different to the one that was
offered by Connoisseur or was that the
[SPEAKER_01]: same one given you were there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the follow-up is, how come we
don't see or hear much of about it from
[SPEAKER_01]: you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, that one, what happened is when
I lost the res dog IBL project,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had another grow house where I had all
of my female selections and my males,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there was a security breach at
that house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what ended up happening is Oji at the
time had Connoisseur genetics and the only
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses he had done was using a G13 haze
male that had come via soma.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the one that he used for a lot
of his crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one got shared around Amsterdam a
fair bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one got pimped out hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one, that got traded over to us
for the Casey Jones cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Casey Jones cut went back the other
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Oji had bred with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened is I had to remove all
my plants from the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my dad, who's just a fucking legend,
he's the most straight going guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just does anything for me to help me
and just supports me so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He literally had to like come to the
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We loaded up like 35 foot plants in big
flat screen TV boxes for removal,
[SPEAKER_00]: loaded them into his van and moved them to
a grow that Oji had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Oji, rather than just holding
onto my plants, just pollinated all my
[SPEAKER_00]: selections with my males and made seeds
with the whole lot for Connoisseur
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, it kind of took my
project from me and I kind of said,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, how about I come in on Connoisseur
genetics together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we become partners at
Connoisseur genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we were working at Connoisseur
genetics, that was the ChemBX project.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that, a whole bunch of things came
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first batch of seeds he made using
my male selection of chem with all my
[SPEAKER_00]: females like motor breath, train wreck,
cross SFV, the Casey Jones, a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, they got made and then I made
another batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The batch that I then made, I remade a few
things like the chem Jones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also made the only batch of grand doggy
perps because when he done the original
[SPEAKER_00]: batch of seeds, we didn't have the GDP cut
in that room because it was my genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: the GDP.
[SPEAKER_00]: The granddaddy purple cut, OJ had actually
sourced that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when he gave it to me, I did a batch of
grand doggy perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the only batch that ever got
made because after that, it was not long
[SPEAKER_00]: after that we lost the cut of the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we weren't able to make any of those
strains again with the same male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been remade by Connoisseur
genetics, a female version, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual regular version was never been
remade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so have you ever wanted to work with
that or is that just kind of falls under
[SPEAKER_01]: that banner of like fresh start thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The grand doggy perps, that is in the
purple project that I had done and the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple projects I've used for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have kind of took it with me because
I've used a couple of different things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone forward with and done like when
I first came to Barcelona, I literally
[SPEAKER_00]: just went through like 400 of all of my
seeds that I had made that I had and just
[SPEAKER_00]: done selections through all of those and
started reselecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went through some of my granddaddy
purple hybrids from when I'd done a
[SPEAKER_00]: reversal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the grape lemonade, purple halitosis,
rainbow Jones, and a few of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: are all seeds that both me and OJ had made
and had the stock to go through when I got
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the last project of connoisseur
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last project I'd done was basically
we'd done the GDP FEM project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we got the Girl Scout
cookies together, we'd done a Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_00]: run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most horrendous thing happened is
that I was fighting broad mites at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time and I was using the Swarovski mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had beaten the broad mites, but I was
still using the Swarovski mite as a
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't realize they eat pollen when
they haven't got bugs to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd done a reversal of the Girl Scout
cookies, pollinated the tent and literally
[SPEAKER_00]: got like three seeds out of this plant,
five seeds out of that plant, two seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, reversals are hard enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you've got a bug that eats
pollen, it turned out to be, that was like
[SPEAKER_00]: before, that was the last project I
actually done with connoisseur genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he'd come across and then we
walked our separate ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that was just a funny one to
learn a very valuable lesson about what
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs eat when they haven't got bugs to
eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I forgot to ask you earlier when we
were talking about the truth, but just in
[SPEAKER_01]: line with, if we look at, a lot of
Australians are on offer now, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: them have got the truth in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at your keep a cut of the
truth, what type of characteristics does
[SPEAKER_01]: it pass on in terms of the female and then
also in terms of the male?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the female, what I've done is I
decided to go all with my own lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I don't really want to be just
breeding other people's stuff and other
[SPEAKER_00]: people's hype work and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I've got has got like,
I've got some kind of hypothesis and idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of what I'm trying to get towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really what I've done is I've got my
two males that are the Truth male and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kem Valley Cooks male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea of them is to have breeding
tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that adds all the favorable
characteristics of the OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has proven itself to be one of the
most, if not the most legendary,
[SPEAKER_00]: like popular strains in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one to have all of the bag
appeal and characteristics of the Kem
[SPEAKER_00]: Valley Cooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the key thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, for me, I want low leaf ratio
to bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to be trimming loads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the Truth, it gives hardly any
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the double edged sword
is you never have no trim from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you hardly have to trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, when you're doing lots,
you don't want to be trimming a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as things become bigger and bigger,
the less you've got to trim and the less
[SPEAKER_00]: people are in, if you can flush a plant to
where the bigger families fall off and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you've got just a basic little
manager, or that you're doing a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds in like a fraction of the time,
then people are going to, that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's even like any grower that I
know doesn't like trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the main characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is branchiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I like good side branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like plants that respond to being topped
well so that they get a good amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: heads on them and that you can top and
train plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always go for that in my,
in my breeding and try and go for a male
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to give good structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just referenced the idea of using
your own lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that breeders should look
more to using females they've found
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves or just in general from their
own projects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think there's also kind of a
space for people who just want to
[SPEAKER_01]: repeatedly cross one male to just a bunch
of clone onlys and don't really search to
[SPEAKER_01]: their own female stock too much?
[SPEAKER_00]: The second bro, I think there's a room for
everyone to do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as, as prohibition comes to a
close, there will be a niche for
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be people that
need to do the latest, greatest and cash
[SPEAKER_00]: in on hype and do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be honest with you, if I was
doing that, I'd be making a lot more money
[SPEAKER_00]: than what I am because I have the
opportunity to get whatever cut I want as
[SPEAKER_00]: quick as I want and then do those kinds of
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, I get no real pride from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get much more pride from creating
something unique and having goals and aims
[SPEAKER_00]: and seeing people be able to find
something unique that then stands out and
[SPEAKER_00]: gives them something that they're able to
work with and turn heads with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for me, just crossing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's just give something that already
exists, I get no, no joy from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I love the fact that anyone can do
whatever they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what breeding's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The key thing is people just need to do
their homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like if you're buying seed from
someone, have a look, see what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing, see where they come from,
see what it's like, see, see if it's hype,
[SPEAKER_00]: see if there's any real work going in,
ask a few questions, do your homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to put in the work,
otherwise you will end up wasting three
[SPEAKER_00]: months of your life growing out a bunch of
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do your homework, it's easy to
find out who the legit ones and get
[SPEAKER_00]: something incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a few other notable breeders
who are in the Spanish scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you socialize much with them or is it
kind of like it's hard to meet up or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot and people are just kind of doing
their own thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had such a hard couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last couple of years, I've had a few
issues with my housing that meant me
[SPEAKER_00]: having to shut down to a minimal,
minimal basis, which has made things super
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's meant that most of my time is
just spent at home working, keeping to
[SPEAKER_00]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sadly, I haven't had as much time as I
would like to be socializing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the scene, but there are lots of
people doing cool things over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I'll be honest,
like that's why I'd love Spannabis so
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's the one time of the year
when everyone's out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get my dad to come and house it for me,
look after my dogs and my plants so that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can be away for the whole week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just socializing, catching up with
everyone, seeing what everyone's got,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing the evolution over the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do get into the city, but not as
much as I'd like, but there's amazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as breeders and people trying
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot of like Spanish underground
guys that are doing cool stuff with like
[SPEAKER_00]: old Neville's haze cuts I've seen around
and little things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones that interest me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of little things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard there's a crew of guys over there
who have been safeguarding the A5 and C5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some friends that have recently
got those as well, as well as the S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it an S5?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an S1 as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think there's one with an S,
the S5 as well, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently heard some friends had that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get those myself and play with
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, why don't you tell us what's your
new project you're looking forward to
[SPEAKER_01]: doing or you've currently got underway
even?
[SPEAKER_00]: The projects I'm most excited about is
like we said earlier is the Afghani,
[SPEAKER_00]: the land race Afghani that I've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I got given some Pakistani land
race seeds from the Neelum Valley and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: done some selection from those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did those both at the same time,
the Pakistanis and Afghanis and the
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers that I've got from those feel like
real building blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got like such strong, unique
flavors, such good, strong, resilient,
[SPEAKER_00]: fast route in healthy genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited about working with those
as well as with my Filipino.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of the mix of those at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing those lines is what I'm going to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be focusing probably,
the next year is going to be focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: the land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the moment I've got a good
selection with my Chem Valley Cooks mail
[SPEAKER_00]: and my Truth Mail that have been released
that I can kind of let those sit for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while and people are going to be able to
enjoy those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always got many strains that are made
that I haven't released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the vault, there's probably another
10 or 15 strains that slowly while I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing all the testing and working on the
land race projects, I can also test some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the things that are in the vault and
slowly if they make the mark or not
[SPEAKER_00]: release them to the public every now and
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for sphannibus, I'm looking to
release something.
[SPEAKER_00]: A purple halitosis crossed the Chem Valley
Cooks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one that I'm working at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just referenced the idea of working
with some land race stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always interested in knowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you ever be willing to travel or
want to travel to collect some land race
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ideas always appeal to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I wasn't so busy and had the funds,
I would definitely do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm so lucky that I've got people like
Himalayan Connection and Land Race
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics and a few other good hearted
people from Instagram that have reached
[SPEAKER_00]: out to me and I've been gifted some very
very special seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some Sumatra Trippingweed from
Indonesia, some seeds from there that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was given by Himalayan Connection that I'm
going to be working with soon and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that for someone like him who
searches out genetics at source and has an
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible network of people to reach out
to me and give me something so unique that
[SPEAKER_00]: he searched out for years and years and
him to see something in me to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: look bro, I think you could do something
special with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited about working with those
soon as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I looked through some of your work just
online and I noticed in a few places that
[SPEAKER_01]: you had essentially worked with some Super
Silver Hayes stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, where did you get that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it from like the pre 2000 stuff or is
it more newer?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the SSSDH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was basically there was a cross from
ResDoc the OJ at Connoisseur Genetics done
[SPEAKER_00]: a selection from and got a Super Silver
Sour Diesel Hayes and that is cross with
[SPEAKER_00]: the cookies, which is in my cookie fever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one, yeah, that was ResDocs Cup,
which is like old, old black pack when
[SPEAKER_00]: Shanty Barber was breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a very special cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say what you want about Res.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have been a bit of a cunt,
but that was a wicked cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's funny that that sentiment comes
up a fair bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've noticed more recently,
you've been doing some co-labs with OCD
[SPEAKER_01]: labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean in practical terms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's your ideal co-lab like?
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, bro, what that is,
that was something that I started myself
[SPEAKER_00]: with a friend of mine way back in like
2013 maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, about 2013, a friend of mine who I
don't work with, like I'll be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: OCD labs now is kind of redundant because
I haven't been really doing much work for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's me that's doing the work now because
my partner went off and done his own thing
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really it's just me making rosin now
through my own genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the concept behind that, bro,
was just literally when I saw how the
[SPEAKER_00]: American industry was going, I knew that
an extract company was essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started an extract company and I had
a friend who runs a, at the time he was
[SPEAKER_00]: just like a forum guy that was on the
forums and he was like in the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was working for like an estate agent,
but he was so on point and obsessed with
[SPEAKER_00]: like the extract game.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the first people that ever
had shatter that was super on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me being on the pulse of things,
I just decided, I'm like, bro,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's start an extract company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can be the front man,
like I'll provide the genetic so let's
[SPEAKER_00]: have an extract company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's doing it in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather have it in-house one and being
able to put out all my genetics and do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then because of all my friends in the
industry, we just made some amazing like
[SPEAKER_00]: links in Amsterdam and we just had a
wonderful golden age in Amsterdam where
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, Ramon from Yellow Brick Labs now,
and another guy called Rick who runs
[SPEAKER_00]: something called, I can't remember the
name of his company now, but he's in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an Amsterdam based guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all ran OCD labs together when I was in
Amsterdam and we did work for SOMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did work for DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did work for Marambeiros and we done
all the stuff for True Kano Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were putting out so many extracts at
a time when there was no scene in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the only other extract company
that existed was Nerd Extracts and that
[SPEAKER_00]: was literally it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of were at the birth of the
revolution of extracts and from Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just had people coming over constantly
from the UK, just getting tons of extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: and just blew up the whole European scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible to see that change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the amount of people that we gave
first abs to that now have glass shops,
[SPEAKER_00]: extract company, edible company,
clothing line, like just crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just to see that everyone who's been
around this scene has been inspired by the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole birth and the influx of social
media, the way that's affected it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge progression, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, the amount of extract companies that
exist in England and it's a country where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's illegal and there are like extract
companies that have built amazing brands,
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of edible companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's wild to think that it's
got to that stage now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if we've touched on it
already, but I'm always keen to know what
[SPEAKER_01]: style of growing are you a fan of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you into the no-till?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you into cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been like, my first ever grow that
I'd done was, remember I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got two friends off my, like two plants
off my friend that he dragged in from
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and they were soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went to the grow shop and like got
set up properly, the guy advised me to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from that day forward, I grew with
cocoa and because I was always so obsessed
[SPEAKER_00]: with getting it clean, I've always loved
cocoa for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I could grow multiple strains,
not have any real deficiencies and get it
[SPEAKER_00]: flushed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like my examples of soil growers and
organic was never great until the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: years since no-till really blew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy called Road Runner 420 UK
who's in the UK of course, and he does
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is one of the people that showed me
what the results can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I know that the best of the
best is always going to be soil grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the problem is it's so hard to get
that right and to dial that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I would do, I once took over a
grow from some people and it's like out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room, I had some plants were like the
best thing I've ever smoked, but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like 20% of the plants were like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't get them all to be right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some deficiencies here and some bits
there and now as a breeder growing so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains all the time,
cocoa is easier for me to maintain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as far as smoking and the best of the
best, my outdoor no-till dragonfly
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine in the ground, in the sun,
that's probably my favorite thing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that's what I really love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I love to grow outdoors if I
could be somewhere at the perfect climate,
[SPEAKER_00]: had a long season, outdoor sun grow,
grown is something magical about those
[SPEAKER_00]: terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like indoors, yeah, if I had a small
tent, I would do no-till, I'd keep it like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may move into that over time,
but it's something I need to practice on a
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller scale, dial in, become confident
with, and then go towards, I can't make
[SPEAKER_00]: such a big jump when I'm dealing with like
30 to 40 different mother plants that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping healthy and making seeds,
but as far as seed wise, the best seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever made are the ones that I made
outdoor organic grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the biggest, fattest,
healthiest, most incredible looking seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have, you know, I have problems
putting them in a vial because they're so
[SPEAKER_00]: much bigger than the normal seeds that you
just about get 15 in a vial.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, that sounds lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like eventually that's where I would
like to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be a progression where
I get the tech right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get myself confident, and then I will
eventually move to a no-till kind of grow
[SPEAKER_00]: setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how close it is, but I think
that's the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, I'm very lucky that I've
got a couple of good nutrient companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: Buddha's Tree and Shogun Nutrients that I
use, and they're both UK based companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've said to people, as a UK breeder,
although I'm not living in the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect the UK growth growers to support
a UK breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I myself try and support UK industry as
much as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to me getting my
packaging or stickers done, I use Sticker
[SPEAKER_00]: Express.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm getting my nutrients, I want a UK
brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want lights, I want Cropmaster LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know, like I will always try my
best to use a UK company if possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm trying to tell people,
look, I'm a UK guy breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got just as good as anywhere in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geography doesn't dictate quality
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the hard work that you put in
and the genetics that you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't push my brand to UK people and
not do the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exciting to hear that you're
almost fully there with the no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a quick shout out to Roadrunner and
Vic Firth, two homies holding it down in
[SPEAKER_01]: the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've talked about how in Barcelona,
there's an established concentrate scene
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as in the broader Spain in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a similar phenomena going on
where vape carts are taking over the scene
[SPEAKER_01]: like we see in the States?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sadly, vape carts are like the
casual smoker kind of thing that people
[SPEAKER_00]: who can't roll a joint or whatever just
want to buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has been a bit of an influx.
[SPEAKER_00]: And amongst all the shit that people have
been bringing over from America,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's like a bunch of like renamed carts
that you could just tell is like hot dog
[SPEAKER_00]: water with extra equal 20, do you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like micro butanol turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what do you think we can do to help
counter this and get people to realise
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, like a really good grown
flower or really nice made concentrates
[SPEAKER_01]: are a superior product?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've got to name and shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people need to go round,
take samples from a bunch of places,
[SPEAKER_00]: get them all tested and then name and
shame people that are putting out products
[SPEAKER_00]: with these things on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then slowly the people that put in the
work and work hard to get a clean room and
[SPEAKER_00]: not use pesticides and not spray things
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I go above and beyond to only
use beneficial microbes and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, because I don't want residue on my
plants because any residue is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: come off in an extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to keep a clean garden and not have
anything with residue is horrendously
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking hard to get to a level where
you're happy and keeping a clean garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard when that's not appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when testing becomes more prevalent,
I can't wait because everything I put out
[SPEAKER_00]: will get tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be one of the points that I
want people to understand is clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: well-grown product that hasn't been
sprayed with shit is not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until people actually know,
it's like it makes me shake to think the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that people are consuming because
the export market that's happening from
[SPEAKER_00]: America of stuff that's going to fail the
standards is just terrible, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the distillate that's coming over,
it's like, man, people are using
[SPEAKER_00]: distillate in things and it's like,
wow, you just know where that's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distillates, you can't get enough
distillate in America to fill the demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's getting out at the prices that
it's getting out at, no wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's the prices where I've had
to say to people like, that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: feasible, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go look in America what it costs to get
clean distillate that's tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ask yourself how you're buying it for
that price in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, people need to wake up and
really pay attention to things because
[SPEAKER_00]: sadly the market is making too much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the minute anything makes a lot of
money, it brings in the wrong type of
[SPEAKER_00]: people and there's opportunists that are
taking, like, how can there be fake
[SPEAKER_00]: diamonds out now?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell is going on in the world
where people are selling tree sap diamonds
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's just crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the black market causes these
problems, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing we can do is just work
towards some kind of regulated market to
[SPEAKER_00]: avoid all the fuck ups.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what do you think is most optimal,
legalization or decriminalization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think decriminalization and allow
people to use their intelligence and allow
[SPEAKER_00]: people to test these things and that to be
part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I think that makes more sense
for people to like, bro, if you want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: an idiot and you want to get the cheapest
thing and you don't care, that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be your mentality no matter what goes on
and you'll always go to a backstreet
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're sensible, you'll look for
the right things that have been tested and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the people that do that will have the
best spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if there's a place in Barcelona
that all of a sudden everything's tested
[SPEAKER_00]: and that certificate says it's clean,
mold, pesticide, fungicide-free,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've done it off of their own back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nearly the ones that people are
going to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones people are going to want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think that brings us to our
quickfire questions before we wrap things
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, first question I wanted to ask you,
what's your favorite food?
[SPEAKER_00]: Curry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from Northwest London.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I've been brought up around West
Indian and Indian people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, people from Jamaica, people from
Grenada, people from like Barbados,
[SPEAKER_00]: so hot Jamaican and West Indian curries
and lots of Indian food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was brought up around a lot of Indian
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the best Indian food in the world
outside India is in London.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we've just got incredible spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, those are my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually miss the Indian and the
Jamaican food from England more than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what's your favorite thing to do in
your spare time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend time with my dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just enjoy living in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going for a peaceful walk with just
nothing around other than beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: scenery.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the most enjoyable times
when I'm most at Peace Row.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a nice few fat dabs and set myself
off on a nice little walk with the dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What has been the most memorable cannabis
you've ever smoked in your whole life?
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked African Land Race when I was like
16.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it made me go blind for like three
minutes on a high street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chasing that high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bro, I've been looking for that one ever
since.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done so many other psychedelics and
drugs in my like adult life and never once
[SPEAKER_00]: has it been as terrifying as those three
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best and worst three minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, on the other end of the spectrum,
what was the worst strain you've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my follow up is, what's the worst
strain you've ever smoked, part one?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then part two is, what's the worst
strain you've ever smoked that somehow got
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of commercial traction and other
people liked?
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst strain I've ever smoked?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from the days of sticks and seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when I was like maybe 1999 or 2000,
yeah, saying 98 or 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: 98, it would have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a mental mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1998, I was getting weed that was
coming in with Albanian guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was like from Albania or
somewhere in that part of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was paying like 25 pound an ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, bear in mind, ounce of weed normally
was like 140.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, 25 pound an ounce for this weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was horrendous, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of the things that started
making me smoke pure because I just had so
[SPEAKER_00]: much of it and you needed to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could smoke so much of it,
you could actually just leave the tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: out and just smoke two grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that was the worst weed I've ever
smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was just funny because I was
getting so much of it and moving so much
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my God, it was terrible, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it might have been hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so, what's in your opinion is the
weirdest strain, which you didn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: like, but commercially it seemed to take
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll probably seem like a fucking hater
for saying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I've never been that taken by
Gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, for me, I can understand why
Skittles is hyped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a profile that makes people go,
wow, it's incredible, the profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can understand why Sherbet is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherbet's got a wicked, I love that
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can understand the hype behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when that kid got hyped up,
I'm like, I've got something that smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like a lot of things,
I've got something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go like, I've got something because
it smells like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got something that smells like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I can see hype when things don't,
but Gelato disappointed me every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've smoked better crosses of Gelato than
Gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been disappointed by all the Gelato,
but some Gelato crosses I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: impressed by.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The inception.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, our next question, you're on a desert
island.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only take three strains with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take my Chem Valley Cooks Male,
and then I would take my Grape Lemonade
[SPEAKER_00]: 23, and then I would take a Turbzilla Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'd get to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to go in many directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some tropical fruit on the
tropical island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy with your coconuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the next one is, if you could have one
clone back that you've lost or one that
[SPEAKER_01]: you wanted, but were just never able to
get your hands on, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one I can get back and I'm going
to get back at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's one that I can never get
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do tell more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I can never get back is a cut
of sour bubble that I had, which is from
[SPEAKER_00]: Bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Bog will say publicly that that's a
freak-fino of bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard from someone that he privately
said it's a sour bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Bubba Kush cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who knows anything about Bubba Kush
knows sour bubble is a Bubba Kush cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to hate on Bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a lovely guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of respect for him,
but sour bubble is Bubba Kush and
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would bet my life on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: May I be struck down by lightning if I'm
telling a lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who smoked it, tell me what you
think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see comments on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that for me, as much as it was that,
it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I criticize him for not
admitting what it was, but I'll be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was probably the silliest thing you
ever done because if he would have said
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day what it was, it would have
blown up even more and been even more
[SPEAKER_00]: hyped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at a time when it was kind of like
reservoir seeds and Bog were the two kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of hype companies online and it was all
about being sour because sour diesel had
[SPEAKER_00]: blown up and Bog was trying to capitalize
and get in on that hype market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he done that cross, called it sour
bubble, but said it's a freak sour-fino of
[SPEAKER_00]: bubblegum because his whole line is
bubblegum based.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've heard he said to someone in
private that, yeah, it's a Bubba Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard that sentiment before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what about the one you can get
back?
[SPEAKER_00]: The TK, the triangle Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting for that one to come back to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of all the things, yeah, the triangle
Kush is the one I'm missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I haven't really made an effort to
get it bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it'll come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually it'll come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm not a chase, chase,
chase thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few people know that I want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually it'll come to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I share that sentiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's an amazing plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss her quite a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next one, the final question,
if you could go back in time, anywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: any place, any time throughout history and
get some seeds, where are you going and
[SPEAKER_01]: when?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go back to when Thailand had loads
of thriving things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something about Thai weed I love,
all the different variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one that I really, really crave
more than anything is the old juicy fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go back to when the juicy fruit
Thai was there and was undisturbed and was
[SPEAKER_00]: just ready for the plucking and get that
to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really solid answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any shout outs or comments you'd like
to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all of the UK scene,
to the guys that rep my stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Matic, Southwood Smokers Club,

[SPEAKER_00]: to the whole UK scene like Bone Mouth
Farms and Bezel who are doing projects
[SPEAKER_00]: together now, getting into breeding and
doing cool collabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone, the whole UK scene that's
thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many like, yeah, there's so
many good companies coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone should really pay attention to
the UK scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a small island, but my God,
the passion there is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Prohibition eventually ends,
you're going to be able to see some
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible growers and people that are
just doing amazing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of those people in the UK,

[SPEAKER_00]: offered me clones, all the people that
have sent me clones, everyone that's
[SPEAKER_00]: helped me get to where I am, supported me
through hard times, people under the
[SPEAKER_00]: chairs, genetics who helped me out of a
difficult, difficult situation and
[SPEAKER_00]: auctioned some seeds for me during a
difficult time and basically covered my
[SPEAKER_00]: rent when I was in dire trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just know that this industry has got
community in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be turning into a big industry,
but in its heart, there is a community and
[SPEAKER_00]: there are people out there that do this
for love and passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pay attention, you'll see who's
who.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, what a lovely sentiment.
