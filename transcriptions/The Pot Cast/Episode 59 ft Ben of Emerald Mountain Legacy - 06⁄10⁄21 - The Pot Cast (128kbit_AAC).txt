[SPEAKER_02]: Here to talk all things Royal Cush,
his brother Mandelbrot, future breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: plans and the Cali scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without further ado, let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty gang, a big thank you and welcome
to the man running the ship at Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain Legacy, the brother of
Mandelbrot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And carrier of the flame, Ben,
thanks so much for joining us today and
[SPEAKER_01]: thanks for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stoked to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's your morning been?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost evening here, but had a good
productive day and been looking forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: talking with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no complaints.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question I love to ask people,
what are you been smoking on today?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of oil spill and a little
garlic mince as well that a friend gave
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garlic mince.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there like a lot of garlic coming
through on that one or more of the wedding
[SPEAKER_01]: mince?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely garlic forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's pretty similar to GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cush mince is kind of hidden in the
back for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, what's your thoughts and
preferences on things like the GMO and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem D?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you generally a fan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not generally a big fan of
cookie hybrids, but that one in particular
[SPEAKER_00]: is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO I think is one of the more unique
profiles that's come out over the last few
[SPEAKER_00]: years for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, just because a little bit of
personal love, you know, we love to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about Chem Dog on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever been a big fan of the Chem
Dog?
[SPEAKER_01]: At all or not so much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for me, I really enjoy Chem Dog
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, you know, almost all of my
favorites, you know, like Headband and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour Diesel and, you know, some of the OGs
and stuff are all relatives of Chem Dog
[SPEAKER_00]: and I enjoy all of them, but I really feel
like it's a good breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe like Chem Dog itself isn't my
favorite smoke, but like almost everything
[SPEAKER_00]: you breed it with is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, you mentioned the oil spill
earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one a lot of people are interested
in, I guess, you know, sort of out the
[SPEAKER_01]: gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe the flavor,
the smell and the effect for people who,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, haven't been lucky enough to
come across it yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a unique one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my favorite phenotypes or
chemotypes are, they have like a two cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: engine oil smell to them, you know,
like it can be a little bit propane-y
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes, but it's, there's like burned
rubber and kind of like road tar and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these kinds of really noxious,
what, you know, like in describing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't sound appealing, but it's
really, really special, the smell and the
[SPEAKER_00]: taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the most potent heavy
indicas or well, it's not even a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: indica, but it's incredibly mercy and
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen a test at like 6% mercy
before, which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a, it's a good one for the real
heavy smokers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that description actually sounds
lovely to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are really into
the sort of, you know, the gas and the
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk and the burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds really appealing, but
something that definitely caught my eye
[SPEAKER_01]: about the oil spill was how it utilized
the XXXOG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had been lucky enough in the past to
try some of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so blown away by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought this is like a sick OG,
so good, but you really don't see it
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a lot of love from other breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any idea why that might be?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a confusing situation because there,
there are a few different cultivars that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been called XXXOG.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that we got a long time ago was
from LA and we got it like a friend of
[SPEAKER_00]: ours who named it XXXOG because he got it
from a small dispensary in the Bay area
[SPEAKER_00]: that was right next to a strip club.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it got its name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's another XXXOG out there that's
purple and it's not that gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I'm not sure exactly where
it all got confused, but the XXX that we
[SPEAKER_00]: use is green and it's super pungent and
it's a real OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like, you know, watered down at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes people are like, oh,
you mean this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not what a lot of people think of
as XXX.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, but it's one of the earlier
OGs that we got our hands on maybe 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago or 15 years ago, at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, generally speaking that sort of
checks out with the one I tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember it was like a bright electric
green and it just full on like lime
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor, like pure lime sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that sound right to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lime and like that chem funk, you know,
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the oil spill seeds that are
available through Emerald Mountain Legacy
[SPEAKER_01]: today, are they quite similar to sort of
the original ones or is there any sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: changes in any of the parents?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what we try to do for the most part
is to keep the the genes pretty open so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find a range in the seeds that we
put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are leaning more toward the royal and
some more to the XXX.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, with our back cross
projects, that's a lot of the time what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to do is to keep a wide array
of phenotypes that are all good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's not like a total crap
shoot, but we have our selections and we
[SPEAKER_00]: use three males a lot of the time so that
you can kind of find a range in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but my favorites are definitely
the greener, more chem, funky,
[SPEAKER_00]: the gassy ones and not the ones that lean
to the royal, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, something I had heard from a
variety of different people who were
[SPEAKER_01]: really fond of the brand was that they
always mentioned the Emerald Legacy seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: or just Emerald seeds in the context of
outdoor and how well they would do
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that sort of a focal part of the
breeding is to sort of cater for that
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor market or it all or it sort of
just happened to be that way?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's been our goal all along for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we started out in coastal
Mendocino where you couldn't grow anything
[SPEAKER_00]: gassy back in the day because of the
climate, you know, like it just couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started out just trying to breed for
ourselves and to make something that was
[SPEAKER_00]: gassy and appealing to the market that you
could grow in our wet climate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like we were in Albion in
Mendocino County where it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: foggy and wet all through summer and then
it rains a lot in the fall, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that's, we were initially just
breeding for our own use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we started, but over the years
we've, you know, gotten a reputation for
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding stuff that can perform well in
difficult climates and that's definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: what people come to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really, really solid point there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess just to loop back to the Triple X
for a moment, you've got me curious now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your all time favorite OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, that's a hard one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Triple X, you know,
because to me it was one of the first,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's a more authentic OG if you
ask me, like the SFV and the Triple X were
[SPEAKER_00]: the only OGs I knew of 20 years ago,
you know, and there are a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: good ones and variations, you know,
but for me, like when I think of OG,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what I think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't consider a lot of the
newer versions to be the authentic real
[SPEAKER_00]: deal, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of discussion around
OG in the community and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of tend to agree with each other that
they think the TK might've been the first
[SPEAKER_01]: or one of the first along with say the
Ghost.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question to you is these other OGs that
have come out slightly afterwards,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe the SFV, maybe the Triple X,
do you think that they were crosses with
[SPEAKER_01]: males or more probably just S1s from the
original?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were accidental creations and
the TK was definitely around sooner,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't in Southern California,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for SoCal and like that market,
I think that the Triple X was more
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalent earlier than the TK was,
but like in Florida, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the TK was around earlier, I would say,
but just from my recollection,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, this is 20 plus years ago,
but the way I remember it is the SFV and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Triple X were more dominant earlier in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool to hear.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take me back.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your first experience smoking
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was 14 and it was my birthday and my
older sister took me to her friend
[SPEAKER_00]: Bishop's house and they had this,
you know, big elaborate bong with
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-chambers, you know, like honey bears
and acrylic tubes and all these tubes
[SPEAKER_00]: going in between them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never smoked before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a huge bong hit, like way bigger
than I should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for half an hour I was like,
oh, I'm not even high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was fucking asleep for the rest
of the day, you know, trying to act all
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was with my older siblings and
shit, you know, remember that super
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the question is, did you sort
of have like an epiphany moment at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point thinking like, wow, this is
something I could really sort of become?
[SPEAKER_01]: A part of, or did that sort of become more
evident later on?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, you know, I hit the ground running
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started at 14, which is pretty young,
you know, and I was a big fan of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the culture of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like not just smoking, but you know,
I was raised by liberal activist political
[SPEAKER_00]: types and just the fact that it was
illegal and it was, you know, kind of this
[SPEAKER_00]: counterculture thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really drawn to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can only imagine what that would
have been like growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you sort of have any,
you know, memories that jumped to mind
[SPEAKER_01]: about what it was like growing up in what
largely could be described as like the
[SPEAKER_01]: epicenter of worldwide cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: It must've been an interesting experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we had a kind of unique
perspective on it because we were born in
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco and we lived there until I
was six and brought, or Mac was 12 and we
[SPEAKER_00]: moved to Montana because my mom needed to
be near her parents who were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: elderly and sick and needed family nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we lived in like the liberal bastion of
San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we moved to a conservative area
in Montana and we were hippies and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we didn't fit in quite right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a shock, you know, to our
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as soon like when Mac was 15,
he moved or he went on tour and then came
[SPEAKER_00]: back to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, a few years later,
when I turned 15, I did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, as soon as I can get out of the
house, I came back to California and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been here pretty much ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, when you first moved back,
what were sort of the real hotspots in the
[SPEAKER_01]: area for cannabis production?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were they still largely speaking the same
ones as today or was the land landscape a
[SPEAKER_01]: little different back then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say it's more or less the
same, but we, so when I was 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: I came out and Mac had established a
little project in Albion in Mendocino
[SPEAKER_00]: County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was kind of the hay day
of cannabis where the prices were
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly high and it, you know,
you can grow a really small scale and do
[SPEAKER_00]: very well for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it was kind of the glory
days where you can grow like 50 pounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: do very well for yourself, you know,
and the climate here was very good for
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't get big yields and all
that, but you can grow incredible quality
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff near the coast for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it was both a great
place to grow, but also politically and
[SPEAKER_00]: just the community here was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were drawn to that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, what sort of strains were they
growing back at that time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you mentioned that, you know,
some of the more gassy stuff didn't do too
[SPEAKER_01]: well, and I'm sure that extends to even
more genetics than just the gassy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I'm sort of wondering what did
do well there at that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: We started with, you know, like Salmon
Creek Big Bud and there was like Highland
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani, like before people started
calling it OG or, you know, this or that,
[SPEAKER_00]: there were like some Afghani land race
stuff, you know, like from the high
[SPEAKER_00]: mountains in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we started with for the
most part, that and the Big Bud and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a few other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we got access to them, we started
growing a lot of sour diesel and OG and
[SPEAKER_00]: headband and stuff, but that we didn't
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were kind of working with what the
local folks around here had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I know you're friends with the
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Gene, we had him on not too long
ago and there's a few strains he remembers
[SPEAKER_01]: growing up with that he sort of wished he
still had access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any that sort of fit that
criteria for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just talking to a friend today,
you know, like the Trinity from Eugene
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best I've ever seen,
but I haven't seen it in a long time and I
[SPEAKER_00]: just saw on Instagram today, a friend
posted a picture and he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the Trinity and I was kind of
shocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to see if I can get that
one back.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd say sour diesel and Trinity and,
you know, like Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a purple Hindu Kush that I used
to grow that was just fucking phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't get that one anymore either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of the best stuff is kind
of hidden away, you know, hard to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it certainly seems like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hopefully some of those old Hindus
pop their heads back out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, me and Gene also
mentioned that there was a few cuts Hindu
[SPEAKER_01]: variety slash those early Afghans that he
was particularly fond of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we sort of fast forward a little
bit from your first grow, your first
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking experience, how did you then get
involved with sort of the growing climate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did it come shortly after or was there a
bit of a time delay?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a couple of years later,
but you know, I was super fortunate to
[SPEAKER_00]: have an older brother who was six years
older and who had all the same interests
[SPEAKER_00]: as I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so like I was not very many 15
year old kids got to just go work on a pot
[SPEAKER_00]: farm, you know, drop out of high school
and do that at that age.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I was just super fortunate to
be related to my older brother and to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of have that entry at that
time, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it was just like, it wasn't
even a choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, here's what you're
obviously supposed to do, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, hard to describe,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it sounds like you were born into it,
which sounds like a path I'm sure many of
[SPEAKER_01]: us wish we had sort of the opportunity to
walk down the way you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm sort of interested in those
early years, you know, when you're first,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, for example, I remember when I first
came to the States, you know, being from
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia, it's obviously all lots of just
tents in people's, you know, cupboards
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I went to the States,
you know, you see these big facilities and
[SPEAKER_01]: you just, you're blown away and just
everything's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that what it was like for you when you
first got to the farm with Mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like because he had been here a
few years before I got here, he had a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole network of people that were doing
the same thing that we were doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or that he was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got to, you know, learn from,
you know, he was really one of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: growers that I've ever known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got to learn from him,
but I also got to see all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: projects that he was maybe involved in on
the side or like, you know, provided
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to people or, you know,
and also his elders, like people who
[SPEAKER_00]: taught him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was really like a crash course,
you know, I got to learn a lot really
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a, what an introductory sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, if you're able to recall any
of the details, do you remember,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, I'm assuming you guys were
outdoor, like we, you were growing
[SPEAKER_01]: organic, I assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, can you give us a rundown on maybe
if you remember any of the genetics you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys grew or like sort of the general
style in which you grew, was it like super
[SPEAKER_01]: soil or like amendments or anything like
that you can recall?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it was definitely organic super
soil, you know, not like the sub cool
[SPEAKER_00]: version, but my brother's own concoction
that he had come up with that he learned,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think from, I'm trying to remember the
guy's name, friend of his in Sonoma
[SPEAKER_00]: County, who, you know, maybe 10 years
older, who had worked on a vegetable farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he, it was basically just a mix
that they used to grow vegetables,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, if you can grow vegetables,
you can cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we started out in the pygmy forest
in Albion, which is a really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: climate because you're growing,
like to avoid being caught, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they had that campaign against
marijuana production back then camp and
[SPEAKER_00]: they flew helicopters all over and they
were really gung ho about eradicating
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were growing in the pygmy forest
where we had some light tree cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there was still a good sun,
but you couldn't see the ground or plants
[SPEAKER_00]: really, because of the, you know,
like a pygmy forest is like a forest where
[SPEAKER_00]: all the trees are stunted and they're
smaller, you know, and they're not as
[SPEAKER_00]: densely populated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the perfect place to,
you know, hide your weed basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were growing really small plants
and doing a lot of them because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you couldn't go too big or
they'd start to be visible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, you know, we had like trenches and
small pots and we just do really a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way we were able to find special
genetics because of the numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were planting at one point,
like hundreds and thousands, even like I
[SPEAKER_00]: think 3000 plants one time to find this
special Highland Afghani that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: really impressed by.
[SPEAKER_00]: One year we were doing like a seed
propagation nursery where we would plant
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and grow them up to be, you know,
18 inches tall and then sell them to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other farmers in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were doing that all through the
season until fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the Highland Afghani that we used
in the Royal was just immune to the bad
[SPEAKER_00]: weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all the other plants were dying and
rotting and, you know, just couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: handle the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one plant just didn't look
bothered by it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, probably one of the
keys to our success and breeding really
[SPEAKER_00]: strong outdoor cultivars is that we were
able to hunt through those big numbers of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and find the really special ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you, you touched on some of the
questions I had for you later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess my first sort of
inclination when you say that is,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you know where those Highland Afghani
seeds come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: They sound like special stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was from Obi from Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the guy who couldn't think of his
name a minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, he was kind of a deadhead
that my brother had met on tour before he
[SPEAKER_00]: settled in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Obi was kind of the key to our
success because he had all the old school
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that he got from his hippie
friends on tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he passed on a lot of that to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so remarkable how much of like the
really influential genetics trace back to
[SPEAKER_01]: like a dead tour in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the truth, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, or, you know, just the concert tour
people in general, like the Trinity that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned before, that was a fish tour
thing that we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a fish concert, you know, and we,
you know, like shake down the street at
[SPEAKER_00]: those shows where everyone's hustling
their different products, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like cannabis, mushrooms, and all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we bought some flour from a guy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were just so impressed by it that
we like hunted him down later and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, begged him to give us this
clone, the Trinity clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's just, it's just a lot
of like-minded people all coming together
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing business and, you know,
partying together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the perfect network for that
sort of exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it makes me wonder, do you feel
like people were sort of more receptive
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day to, for example,
sharing clones with people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I guess it sort of feels like at
times there can, you know, somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: understandably be a bit of hesitation and
giving clones out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like that's changed a bit
since back then?
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it depends on the group and
the circumstances, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, if you were like a really
passionate follower of the Grateful Dead,
[SPEAKER_00]: you were kind of in a club with these
other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like a big family, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there wasn't that hesitancy to share
that you find more often today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's become a lot more
commercial and more of a profit-motivated
[SPEAKER_00]: thing than it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we were all making a good
living, but that wasn't the reason that we
[SPEAKER_00]: started doing it necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we were really passionate
about the herb itself and also the music
[SPEAKER_00]: and the whole thing, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you remember when it was you did
your first indoor grow or was it just all
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor for the longest time?
[SPEAKER_00]: That, so, you know, we lived in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lived in Mendocino on the coast for a
couple of years, and then we moved inland
[SPEAKER_00]: to Greenfield Ranch outside of Ukiah,
which was just an ideal growing
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did that for a few years and then
we moved up to Arcata in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's when we started doing
indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was about 2002, 2004 in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we lucked into a big warehouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And downtown Arcata, which is an
interesting story in itself, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we had gotten busted or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get in trouble, but our,
we got cut down on Greenfield Ranch and it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of motivated us to try to do indoor
to avoid having that happen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had this warehouse in Arcata,
you know, it was, you know, a few blocks
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the Plaza, a few blocks away
from the police station.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, we did pretty big indoor in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, you know, pretty bold.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother wasn't as afraid of the
consequences as a lot of people were back
[SPEAKER_00]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that continued for 10 years in
Arcata at the warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you had to really risk it for the
biscuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that because one of our
listeners had submitted a question where
[SPEAKER_01]: they had been, you know, following both
yours and Mac's work for some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just gave a brilliant question,
very succinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, any crazy warehouse days
stories from Arcata?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, so we rented this place from a
tiling company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, you know, it was like where they
stored all the tile for their business and
[SPEAKER_00]: they did tiling for, you know,
homes and businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: All around town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they upgraded their space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we rented their warehouse from them
and we built four, 10 light rooms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we kept the whole front of the
building looking like a tile business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you could come into the building and
it looked like just shelves and shelves of
[SPEAKER_00]: tile and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you go through a
couple of more doors and then you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my brother was friends with the guy
who owned a local coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to mitigate the smell, we would
pile coffee grounds outside right near
[SPEAKER_00]: where the ventilation came out of the
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we use carbon filters and
everything too, but it's still even with
[SPEAKER_00]: the filters with, you know, really good
quality or a bit hard to keep that smell
[SPEAKER_00]: under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the coffee helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is like the sort of like back in the
days when there's no carbon filters,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you just coming up with any way to
keep it all going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever have any like close calls
where you were like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the heart's racing and you're like,
Oh God, this is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not really at the building
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were times when there was kind of a
general odor of cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood, but you couldn't pinpoint
where it was coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you'd be a block away and you
could smell the weed we were growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you couldn't tell where it was coming
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was kind of a funny
thing that, uh, the amount of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that was there and it was so close to the
police station and the busiest part of
[SPEAKER_00]: town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, also just a couple of
blocks from Safeway in Arcata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but no, we never really had any heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just sometimes would be stinking up the
neighborhood and people would be asking
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, but they wouldn't know who to
blame.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine some young teenagers just
walking around the block, just frustrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't pinpoint it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, when you started growing
indoor, I'm assuming the quality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis went up a bit compared to the
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that cause you to have any preference
between the two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I know me personally, like I really
like certain strains outdoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think if I had to give a blanket
rule, I sort of prefer indoor these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that cause anything like that in you
at all having experience with the both?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I wouldn't go so far as to
say that indoor is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely make more attractive
looking and probably a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: potent flower indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing organically in a
good climate, that's not too hot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like you can produce better
terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are, you know, more terpene rich
product outdoors where it gets colder at
[SPEAKER_00]: night and you have that like saline
humidity, you know, that you can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: beat mother nature in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as terpene production goes,
I don't think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but definitely for potency and the
looks indoor was better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as far as what people
wanted to buy, you know, a lot of it was
[SPEAKER_00]: just based on the look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, more marketable product,
but not better in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, given when we discuss the
seeds that you and your brother have made
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years, there's always this
notable element of how enjoyable it was
[SPEAKER_01]: for an outdoor strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any of the lines you're
associated with that you think just sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of in your mind, at least definitively,
you prefer them to be outdoor grown than
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the Royal, the Royal Kush,
um, it doesn't get as gassy and musky
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors as it does outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's still good,
but there's a unique profile to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow it in a outdoor climate that
gets kind of cold at night, it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different appeal than if you grow
it indoors, you know, and, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still great indoors, but it's not the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like terpene profile at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, especially certain,
like the gassy or phenotypes are way
[SPEAKER_00]: better grown outdoors with cold nights
than they are indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'll, I'll be honest, I've only
actually been able to smell and smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the Royal one time, but it was a
legitimate source.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, um, I got it through a friend of
the dragonfly earth medicine crew when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was at one of their parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remembered it was outdoor and I
remembered smoking it and thinking,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is one of the most unique terpene
profiles I've ever smelled in the sense
[SPEAKER_01]: that you could smell the Afghani,
you could smell the sour, but you could
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely smell the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that was what, like,
there was just something so intoxicating
[SPEAKER_01]: about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember the first time you smelt
it and were you sort of similarly blown
[SPEAKER_01]: away the way I just sort of described it
or how did that go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before it was ever called Royal Kush,
it was a purple Kush diesel Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was in the Arcata warehouse and
we, um, we had about 15 phenotypes that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we made the first generation,
uh, crossing the purple Kush with the
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, there were about 15 phenotypes
and we labeled them all PKDA one,
[SPEAKER_00]: two, three, four, five, six, you know,
um, all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there, it wasn't like I just
experienced the Royal as we know it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like this whole array of,
or a spectrum of the different parents,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kind of just grew them,
you know, two or three cycles in
[SPEAKER_00]: different, you know, different rooms and
with slightly different feeding regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we didn't really discover the most
amazing ones until we had been growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of different versions of it for a
year or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so then the PKDA eight was the
one that ended up being called Royal Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, you know, it was purple,
but it was mostly sour diesel terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile with that Afghani too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the Urkel didn't really come
through in the flavor, the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the color that came from that
in the one that we liked the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is this the cutting which sometimes I
read about online is called the Royal Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: seven or is that different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seven is a clone that Kevin Jodry
selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or, well, I don't know exactly know
how it all played out, but it's the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that he liked the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one that I liked the best is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, um, more diesel leaning than that
one is, but for you know, for outdoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, mold resistance and like the grow
ability, I would say that's the best one,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seven, but the PKDA eight,
the diesel one was my personal favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: for smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, different folks, different
strokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess something I'm interested in is
that you've got all these, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible strains that, you know,
in the area regarded as super well known
[SPEAKER_01]: in just pretty much all of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of Mac's work is just really
well recognized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember him ever talking to you
about like the process of when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, he sort of comes home one
day and he's like, Oh man, I just found
[SPEAKER_01]: this sick fino in these seeds I popped
that I made like sort of as it was going
[SPEAKER_01]: along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember him talking about it or
it, or it more so just sort of appeared at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the whole creation process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was collaborative, you know,
like we would, there were us and a few of
[SPEAKER_00]: our friends and people who worked at the,
uh, warehouse in Arcata, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what Mac would do was he would just jar up
and label like a dozen samples or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he would let everyone try them
and we kind of decide together what
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone liked the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it would change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be like, okay, we all,
we agreed that this one's the best
[SPEAKER_00]: overall, you know, and then you grow it a
couple more times and you'd be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, nevermind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going, you know, this one's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was really convoluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even remember exactly how that all
went because there, you know, we were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a lot of breeding projects all at
once, not just the Royal, but we were also
[SPEAKER_00]: working on like the Maui super dog and you
know, um, we bred a lot with some super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk and Maui and a chem dog and headband
and you know, so the Royal was just one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those projects that we were working on all
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had hundreds of jars of really
good flour that we were always,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, trying to improve on and work in
different directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you had so many incredible
crosses on the sort of horizon for you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys that it was hard to see that just one
of them was standing out to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned the super skunk,
which is Australian, which comes up
[SPEAKER_01]: regularly on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your recollections of the super
skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you have any seeds with it as like
one of the parents that maybe you're sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of keen to get into at some point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a little fuzzy because so long
ago, but the super skunk that we got was a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone and we were told it was from
Amherst, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we called it the Amherst.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amherst super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was also the Amherst sour diesel
that we got from the same guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think that that was not so dog,
um, or Francis is his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we got a lot of good stuff from
him, but it was so long ago, like I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even know Francis at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother had gotten these plants from
him, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the story as I remember it now,
but like I never actually met Francis
[SPEAKER_00]: cause he was real private back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but the Maui and the skunk and the,
uh, diesel all came from him and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a little confusing in my
recollection, but he had all the good East
[SPEAKER_00]: coast stuff and traded with my brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we had the LA Kush, which was one
that was really incredible too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think my brother traded that to
Francis for a bunch of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we actually had a few questions
from the listeners about that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the really big ones that people
were interested in hearing about was,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just read you word for word what the
question submitted was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that'll make it easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've just said, I'd like to know if
Ben knows anything about the seeds or cuts
[SPEAKER_01]: not so dog passed off to Mac.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the super dog question
mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a super skunk cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any recollections about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it still exist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the way I remember it, we got the
super skunk and the chem dog as clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds of the Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the, I don't think that we got
the, the skunk by chem or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the skunk dog or, you know,
I think that we got them individually from
[SPEAKER_00]: Francis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I remember it, but it was
so long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not totally sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but so there was a chem dog and the
sour and the skunk and the Maui and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were all individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one we had, which is sort of in
that same line is what's Ben's thoughts on
[SPEAKER_01]: the Maui dog slash super dog currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says I'm running the Maui dog cross
I-95.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you, you didn't do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the super dog cross I-95,
that would have been someone else I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: assuming.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did Maui super dog, which, you know,
so it was the super skunk, the chem dog
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where our truth came out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the truth was just one
selection of that Maui super dog that we
[SPEAKER_00]: had made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I don't, I don't know that much
about the, I know that there's a skunk dog
[SPEAKER_00]: out there that we didn't make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a Maui dog out there,
you know, like a lot of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: people breed have either been done before
or are, you know, happening simultaneously
[SPEAKER_00]: in different people's hands in different
parts of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are definitely versions of
all this stuff that we had nothing to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with, or, you know, like might be real
similar, but weren't ours or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the Maui super dog is where our
version came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what, let's, let's loop
back and jump into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sort of makes sense chronologically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I looked online, if you look
at the forums, the sort of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the big three strains that just,
you know, continuously pop up when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: reading about Emerald Mountain seeds or
Emerald Mountain legacies is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Royal Cush, the truth and the 707
headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I guess my question is how did these
come about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they come one after the other,
or were they all occurring, as you sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned a bit earlier, like at the same
time, or was there a progression?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all in the same window within a
couple of years of each other,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, like when you start a
big breeding project, it takes a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: to hunt through it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we, we started out by doing like
three rooms of open pollination where we
[SPEAKER_00]: just had one male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a bunch of different females in there
with that male, or sometimes it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: three males of the same thing,
you know, so you get a lot of variation or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, so the, the Maui Superdog and the
PKDA that became the Royal were definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, I think that, uh,
so there was a headband out there before
[SPEAKER_00]: ours and it was just headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I remember it, as it came from
a guy named Weasel and I don't know much
[SPEAKER_00]: about him or anything like that,
but our version, the 707 headband was that
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed with the diesel Afghani that we
had made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's a headband out there
that isn't as well known, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I don't even know honestly all
the details, but, um, our version,
[SPEAKER_00]: this 707 headband was the original
headband crossed with the diesel Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember in a recent episode,
we were sort of getting the rundown on the
[SPEAKER_01]: different headbands from Bob Hemphill
because he has quite a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he mentioned that, like, uh,
Mack had been one of the people who
[SPEAKER_01]: brought one of them to the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was, I think he might've said
that the, what you referenced earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: the LA Pure Kush might've even sort of got
turned into a headband or renamed or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember anything along those
lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, the, the they're very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember exactly how it all
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that we got the LA Kush from our
friend Akasha in Los Angeles area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, we had that at the same time and
we had the other headband and we had the
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I remember it, it was just the
original headband crossed with the diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani, but we did have that LA Kush at
the same time, you know, and my memory is
[SPEAKER_00]: not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have it a little mixed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the LA Kush had a little different
thing going on, you know, uh, had a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more leaning toward the chem than the 707
headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, we did get like, we had,
my brother was known for distributing
[SPEAKER_00]: those cuts early on the LA Kush,
the headband, the SFEOG and the sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think he bred all of that
stuff because he was the first one that
[SPEAKER_00]: had it back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, 25 years ago or 23 years
ago, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, he didn't take credit for
this stuff, but because he was the source
[SPEAKER_00]: in North, like Northern California hadn't
seen any of that stuff before he started
[SPEAKER_00]: pumping out the clones in Arcata.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of confusion as to like
where it all came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people have credited him
for breeding the SFV for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he didn't, he just got it before
anyone else did or, you know, that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you may not remember,
but do you remember sort of around this
[SPEAKER_01]: time, what, out of curiosity, what were
some of Mac's favorite strains to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, definitely headband and the LA Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the LA Kush was probably his,
what he smoked the most for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the sour, he was a huge,
huge fan of the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess those two would be his top
smokers, the sour diesel, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: original sour and that LA Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, two powerhouse picks right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as you're concerned, do you think
the original sour still exists?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that we had for a long time and
still have, a lot of people call it the AJ
[SPEAKER_00]: sour, but I don't know for sure if AJ had
anything to do with it or what,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was a clone that we got from
a friend in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which version, you know, but I've seen it
called AJ sour previous, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then it was just the only sour
that existed as far as I knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there wasn't like, Oh, it's this one or
that one or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's one of those ones,
which I'm not sure if I ever really had
[SPEAKER_01]: real sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to know, you know, cause people
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so mythically it's, um, it's sort of
hard to know, are you trying the real
[SPEAKER_01]: thing or like, what's the situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, with old clones,
they, they sort of start to confide a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, I mean, the real sour is so
special that you would know if you found
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, uh, really unique and
special, you know, it's kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation for our whole breeding program,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, both for my brother and
I, it's kind of the, the, the origin of
[SPEAKER_00]: all of it and our, our favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last question sort of from a super
historical basis I had for you was,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you remember what it was like when OG
first hit the local scene you're in or we
[SPEAKER_01]: were already a part of the community?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I'm sort of wondering,
was it just like this monumental sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: paradigm shift when it first got up there
or was it sort of slow to catch on and
[SPEAKER_01]: then it started dominating things more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so it was very hard to find,
you know, no one in the Emerald Triangle
[SPEAKER_00]: had it until my brother got the clones and
started pumping them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the people who had it kept it to
themselves and, you know, it was special
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was so coveted, the flower,
that the people who had it didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: let it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were lucky to have a friend who
passed it to us and didn't give any rules
[SPEAKER_00]: on whether we could give it out or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my brother just started pumping it out,
you know, the, all of that stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: the headband, the SFV, the LA Kush and the
Sauer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he kind of changed the whole game
and the Emerald Triangle that way,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he was making thousands and
thousands of clones every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there weren't a lot of people doing
that because it was so risky to have so
[SPEAKER_00]: many plants back then, you know,
so like it definitely started the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: transition to everyone growing gas out of
that Arcada warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've just made me realize I'd be a fool
if I missed this opportunity to ask,
[SPEAKER_01]: given, you know, how many clones you guys
must've done over the years, how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: root clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your method for doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite for my own projects is easy
cloner and then putting them directly into
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, in a four inch pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you like get a nice healthy root mass
and then transplant that big ball roots
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil in a four inch pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, there are a lot of good
ways to do it, but I don't really like to
[SPEAKER_00]: have Rockwell or Oasis cubes or any of
that stuff in my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I feel like it's, you know,
there's always algae and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to use an easy cloner and then
just take the plant with the roots and put
[SPEAKER_00]: it directly into some good soil and avoid
those mediums that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A man after my own heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the followup is how would you
broadly describe your grow style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it sort of like a no-till sort of
thing, or is it a little bit of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: mixture of other things?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do it in soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much copy my brother's methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just making a really rich,
very humic and very like a compost heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a lot of amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the most part, just feeding
or, you know, just watering and you use a
[SPEAKER_00]: little molasses and some kelp and stuff in
your liquid feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, maybe sometimes make a,
a, a fertigated tea with some guanos or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you just start with really good
soil, that's got all the stuff in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it gives it time to break down
and to become available when the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're growing, you're
growing organically and you're making
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid food for your plants, it's,
it's not really doing anything for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you water it in, it has to break down
and, you know, the whole, the biology in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil has to really have some time to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you need to have it all in there at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, we've got a pretty healthy
population of outdoor growers who are
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners for the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any, you know, maybe really
good tips or tricks in your mind that
[SPEAKER_01]: might help them get more out of their
outdoor plants or something which maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: you see people often doing wrong when
they're outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, that's a big question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm not going to tell
people my way is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know what works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's so many variables
and just like how much you water and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much like, or maybe my soil recipe is
going to be too hot for some people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it might burn plants or,
you know, depending on environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and all of these different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very hard to give advice that is
going to apply to everyone or to every
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really, I can't, I can't say much on
that just because it's so specific to
[SPEAKER_00]: different variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but for people who really don't
know where to begin, I would say to read
[SPEAKER_00]: the article my brother wrote, the low down
on dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find that on our website at
emeraldmountainlegacy.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is pretty, you know, it's old,
he wrote that more than 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a real good introduction to all
of that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, gang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some required reading homework for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone, I'm going to go have a read on
that one myself after we wrap things up
[SPEAKER_01]: here, but that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we fast forward a little bit,
I'm sure a lot of people are aware,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, you know, really sadly in 2015,
Mack passed away and I guess I'm just sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of wondering how did that change things
when he passed away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it obvious to you that you needed to
continue Emerald Mountain or was it a more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a slow discovery as you sort of grieved
and dealt with his loss?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, it was a whirlwind,
you know, it started out just my younger
[SPEAKER_00]: brother and I, you know, like Mack passed
in October of 2015 and his crop was still
[SPEAKER_00]: standing and, you know, he has kids that
needed to be provided for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it started out just my younger brother,
Bogie, and I helping to harvest that crop
[SPEAKER_00]: and to try to, you know, turn it into cash
for the kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a big undertaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it all happened,
like my daughter was born that summer
[SPEAKER_00]: right before my brother passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, you know, I was balancing a lot
of plates for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to, you know, raise an infant and
provide for my own family and to help get,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a solid foundation for my
brother's kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really didn't even have time to
think about a plan at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, dealing with
circumstance after circumstance and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to just get through it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't, it kind of all just happened
one step after another and I didn't plan
[SPEAKER_00]: any of it really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny to think about it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so it started out just trying to
like make sure his crop went to where it
[SPEAKER_00]: should and, you know, we tried to save the
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first year, like, so he was
about a hundred grand behind on his
[SPEAKER_00]: mortgage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had gotten robbed about a year before
he passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was really far behind on the
mortgage and we were just trying to save
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm and save the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was our focus initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then shortly after he passed,
the new laws in California kicked in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the adult yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Mendocino County, they said that,
you know, the only people eligible to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply for licenses are pre-existing
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's really unfortunate
because my brother passed right before his
[SPEAKER_00]: like lifelong career became legal and like
something that he could admit to doing
[SPEAKER_00]: publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was very underground and you know,
like using code names and fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: pseudonyms or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just, you know, six months after
he passed, it was all of a sudden legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure, you know, he wasn't a fan of
the regulated market and licensing and all
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I think he would have
eventually been happy to be able to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out and speak more openly about what he
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like not use the pseudonym and,
you know, like, you know, hard to explain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, you know, he passed right before it
all changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you finally started to sink
your teeth into the idea of doing Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain Legacy, was there anything that
immediately jumped to mind as like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, you know, like we've got to crack
these seeds and start doing this strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: what was sort of first on the agenda?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had done this huge shotgun crux is
what he called it, where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: he had a bunch of female plants and he had
two groups of males, the Maui Superdog and
[SPEAKER_00]: like OG Truthband males on one side and
the Royal Kush males on the other,
[SPEAKER_00]: a big open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like his thinking was that,
you know, there would be a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: like cross pollination where you don't
know for sure what the male was,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that you'd have like the plants on the
one side would be mostly pollinated by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Royal males and the plants on the other
side would be mostly pollinated by the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth and the OG Truthband males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had this like ridiculous amount
of seeds and they were all just labeled by
[SPEAKER_00]: number based on what the female was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so we had this catalog of
like hundreds of different plants and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just, it was a ton of work
trying to sift through and find the
[SPEAKER_00]: special stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't even finished that work,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a big project on our hands,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it raises the question when you're
looking to work on a project, how many
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds or what sort of numbers do you like
to run to sort of be confident you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: a good idea of what's in the seeds,
what's lurking there, what might not be
[SPEAKER_01]: there?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you like to do the phenohunt,
so to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, to find special plants,
you need to grow a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would always try to do one
project at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my brother would always do these
massive projects that you'd have so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different combinations that it's almost
impossible to grow them all out and find
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that's in there, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the way he thought about it is he
would make sure to use really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: parents and then to give those seeds out
to people so that they could find special
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, I think that really
works for certain people who like to hunt
[SPEAKER_00]: through a bunch of different stuff and
find special ones and keep them around as
[SPEAKER_00]: clones or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I found is that what people
wanted from me after he passed was to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that had been found out there
and that were really special and just to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that we had versions of those
things commercially available,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so really just trying to make sure we
didn't lose anything was my focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, understandable that you'd want to
make sure none of those lines go dead,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sort of segues into the next few
questions I had for you nicely in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're working with these lines and
they're sort of established and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to preserve them, how do you go
about preserving them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you looking to utilize all the females
and males that don't have hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_01]: traits or are you still doing some minor
amount of selection or is it just a
[SPEAKER_01]: free-for-all open pollination?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely depends on where you start
in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, with the Royal Kush,
my brother had already back-crossed it
[SPEAKER_00]: seven times, eight times actually,
or well, no, the first generation then
[SPEAKER_00]: seven back-crosses to get to the eighth
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the Royal, for example,
his goal was to get that to the 10th
[SPEAKER_00]: generation of back-crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just continued with that until we got
to the 10th generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm doing that with the oil spill too,
but we're only on the seventh generation
[SPEAKER_00]: on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea of back-crossing for us was
that you keep most of the genetic material
[SPEAKER_00]: from the original so that there's still
some variability and it's kind of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: original cross where you have a bunch of
different phenotypes, some of them leaning
[SPEAKER_00]: towards one parent, some of them leaning
towards the other, but more and more like
[SPEAKER_00]: once you get pretty far down that road,
then your focus in my mind should shift to
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to isolate the special individuals
and make seeds of those individuals that
[SPEAKER_00]: come out mostly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I've been working on recently is
trying to like isolate the sour-leaning
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype of Royal Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Afghan-leaning one and the grapey
strawberry one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after getting to that 10th generation
back-cross, now I'm working on making F2s
[SPEAKER_00]: and F3s of like the sour and the Afghan
and the strawberry and grape versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with those projects, the goal would
be for the seeds to all be mostly the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And isolated into those different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are so many different goals for
different purposes and stuff that it very
[SPEAKER_00]: much depends on what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant answer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you might've sort of answered
this next question, but I'll just double
[SPEAKER_01]: back just to make sure we got the right
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our listeners was wondering,
they said, is it true that there's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: Royal Kush phenome that's sort of like a
strawberry jam?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, is it like a unicorn?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the average person have any chance of
finding it or it's really buried in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there definitely is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very much different from all the
other Royal selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it out as the snozzberries this
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we're sold out of it right
now, but if you want that strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: selection, that's the question of the
Royal Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, you know, it's not very similar to
Royal otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not gassy and it's not very
strong smoke as flour, but it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the strawberry terpenes come out
very, very strong and concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just tastes incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most like strawberry of anything
I've ever seen out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, it's not that impressive as
flour, but when you concentrate it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really, really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's what that one's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go, people.
[SPEAKER_01]: The snozzberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had seen that one when I was looking at
all the different strains on offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, just touching back on what you
mentioned before about having done the BX8
[SPEAKER_01]: and even to the 10, I guess I'm wondering,
are there any, you know, perceivable
[SPEAKER_01]: differences you've found between say the
F1 and the BX10 in the, I'm sure by the
[SPEAKER_01]: BX10 you've got the phenotypes and the
type of plant you want in seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but have you seen a gain or loss of any
traits since that F1 generation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you set out with a goal and
sometimes you get there and sometimes you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that the eighth generation
back cross was the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, our goal was to get to the
10th generation back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did that, but it didn't improve
from the eighth to the 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that inbreeding depression is
probably the reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so basically the 10th generation has
some really incredible plants and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the gaseous phenos of Royal that I've ever
seen, but it also has some that aren't as
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable too, you know, and it's so,
with the 10 you kind of have to hunt
[SPEAKER_00]: through and find the really special ones
and keep them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the eighth generation,
you could grow them out and they were all
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they were all very good,
not quite as good as some of the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: you find in the 10, but better than a lot
of the others, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a breeder, like I don't use like
genetic testing and stuff to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like genome mapping and all this
high tech stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we are used to doing it for so
long that I don't really use those tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you might set out with a goal of,
you know, let's say trying to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: gaseous Royal that you can and you'll try
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you won't get there the way you
meant to, you know, and you'll have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back and start again at a certain point or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, undertaking a
project, you know, that's at least 10
[SPEAKER_01]: generations deep, it makes sense that you
maybe need to go back at certain points
[SPEAKER_01]: and relook at things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sort of plays into the next question
being that there's a lot of people with a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of sort of Royal stock,
you know, different generations,
[SPEAKER_01]: different sources, maybe just F2 and give
into them by a mate sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, I mean, maybe it's not an F2,
maybe it's an F6 or F7 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my question becomes, have you
found a breeding style that you prefer
[SPEAKER_01]: more?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you prefer to back cross those
lines or do you think filial breeding like
[SPEAKER_01]: F2, F3 sort of brings more to the table or
does it have different purposes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the way the cannabis business
has evolved, I think that filial breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to please more people,
but it depends on the people that your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is catering to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, my brother definitely liked to hunt
through a bunch of different plants and to
[SPEAKER_00]: find ones that were like his special one,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of people out there
that are that way where they want
[SPEAKER_00]: variation and they want to find their
unicorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hunt is really thrilling for them,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more commercial this all becomes,
the more people just want some seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: all come out the same and are pretty good,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd say it's going further and
further towards the direction of people
[SPEAKER_00]: just wanting seeds that come out
consistently so that they can mix those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants together and market that product as
one product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are still those people who want
to have a bunch of different ones and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're okay with the fact that they can't
mix the flowers together and sell them as
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're definitely going to continue
with both, but we're going to be focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: more on making F2s and F3s and isolating
traits into seed lines that are consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's more often than not these
days, that's what people need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, yeah, what you said reflects,
you know, a little bit of the changing
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It causes me to wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've made a lot of really nice looking
crosses since starting to work with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Mountain Legacy brand,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of them had really, really caught my
eye, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, obviously the old Faithfuls,
but new releases like the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the 47 and the Black Lime Pie and the
Royal Limes, all things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of all the new lines you've been
putting out, what are some of the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're most impressed with and are
maybe considering doing more with going
[SPEAKER_01]: forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those you mentioned, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Royal Wedding, I think,
is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Royal Limes and the Royal
Wedding are my two favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like wedding cake a lot,
but the Royal Wedding takes most of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: appealing about wedding cake and puts it
in a eight and a half week finisher,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, you know, wedding cake goes really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty long and that's difficult for
a lot of outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Royal Wedding is something really
special because it's that really high
[SPEAKER_00]: demand product, but it finishes fast and
it's easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd say both, I like it a lot and
it's very popular because of that early
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing and really appealing product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the Royal Limes, there's one
Unicorn Fino that might be my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: weed ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like very skunky and very limey,
but it also has that like vanilla skittles
[SPEAKER_00]: element to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flavors don't really muddle,
like they don't mix together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you squeeze a flower once and it
smells like skunk and then you squeeze it
[SPEAKER_00]: again and it smells like vanilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, and it's limey or,
you know, it's like it's unique in that
[SPEAKER_00]: way where it has a lot of different
elements to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they kind of come out at different
times and it's not like blended together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's unique in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Black Lime Pie is another amazing one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it could be really loud
cherry or really limey or more royal
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant, really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as looks, that one's probably the
best looking flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, but you know, it's different
strokes for different folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of good stuff in there and
it depends what you're into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's interesting you mentioned the
Royal Wedding because that was one I had
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of scribbled down and thought that
looks really neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess as a follow up to what you
sort of already touched on with that one,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you plan to maybe continue taking some
of the popular, you know, your wedding
[SPEAKER_01]: cake type wines where they're that real
sort of hype market and then trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: work those into sort of more grower
friendly lines, be it, as you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, faster flowering or it
sort of handles the conditions a bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something we might see going
forward or more of a one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes time, you know, because if
you're growing for people who are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow outdoor, you don't want to be
breeding that stuff indoors because like
[SPEAKER_00]: the the heritable traits, you know,
like it's like a climate type,
[SPEAKER_00]: like people from the Andes developed
barrel chests over time so that they could
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe better in that really high
altitude that their ancestors come from,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that, where if you're going to
grow outdoors in a difficult climate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to breathe outdoors in a
difficult climate or you're going to move
[SPEAKER_00]: away from those traits that were so
helpful to you in that environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so we can only do one breeding
cycle a year outdoors in the natural way
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would do that if you're trying to
produce something that wouldn't perform
[SPEAKER_00]: well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of breeders can get through four
or five filial generations in a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't, you know, not when we're
intending to provide for people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are working on those each one of
those lines right now, but it's it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: slow process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, looking on the website and another
thing sort of related to the outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: growing was I noticed that there was a few
packs where you were selling them in much
[SPEAKER_01]: larger volumes, like, you know,
like maybe 100 plus seeds in a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you release because
you're sort of trying to cater for outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: growers or is it more so that people can
run big phenohunts and find that really
[SPEAKER_01]: special one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's something that we're
going to do more going forward,
[SPEAKER_00]: offering bulk quantities at a discounted
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know for sure how much demand
there would be for that, but I just put
[SPEAKER_00]: out the spice cream in 120 packs and that
was really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are really into it, you know,
because they're getting a good deal and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do that more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, cool, cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the questions submitted by one
of our listeners was they were wondering
[SPEAKER_01]: if you had noticed any specific traits on
the Royal line, which might indicate that
[SPEAKER_01]: the male was going to be a good breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess this is probably subjective in
terms of what traits you want to pass on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess they're just generally
wondering, you know, anything to keep an
[SPEAKER_01]: eye out for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Royal, we most often do our
selections for males based on vigor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just strong plants that get
bigger than the others faster,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also on stem rub, which is a tricky
thing because to really have a good stem
[SPEAKER_00]: rub, I think a plant needs to be grown
totally organically and it will have a
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger stem rub, you know, the smell if
it's done outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing outdoors and you're
doing it organically, look for the really
[SPEAKER_00]: funky kind of skunky, gassy, rubbery stem
rub in your Royal male.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you won't find them very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of the plants will all have the
same smell when you rub the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then one in 50 will be really
incredible compared to the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have enough of them to hunt
through and find the one that really
[SPEAKER_00]: stands out with a strong stem rub,
that's a good bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But going off of vigor is another good way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OK, that that all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, if we talk specifically about
the Royal Kush line itself and the
[SPEAKER_01]: backgross project, are there any
particular traits that you're looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: really focus on and preserve slash take it
forward in that direction, or is it more
[SPEAKER_01]: of just keeping it open?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I said, I'm isolating the
different traits that we liked in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Royal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, that's the early finishing sour
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's greener and sour diesel turf
dominant, but early finishing because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what really made popular or the
Royal popular was its early finishing mold
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant gas and it's purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's definitely something we're going
to continue to refine and isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also a really special
Afghan dominant that's more like an OG,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot greasier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it has the you know how the resin can
if you put it in a bag, some herbal like
[SPEAKER_00]: rub grease all over the inside of the bag
and some won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be more dry, crumbly resin,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to get a greasy OG
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the strawberry and the grape
selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're isolating those into their own
groups and trying to make, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: individual, they'll still be Royal Kush,
but we'll say like, this is the strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: selection and this is the sour diesel
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, just a moment ago when you
were referencing the stem rubs,
[SPEAKER_01]: you sort of mentioned like, you know,
you might get a skunky sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole family and you know,
sort of hot topic in the community at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment is skunk genetics, you know,
particularly that more acrid sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you have any memories of
or something you'd like to work with going
[SPEAKER_01]: forward or you're sort of more focused on
other stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just as intrigued by all of that as
most everyone else seems to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy skunk terpenes and you
know, as far as strong smoke, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the strongest out there if you
find the, you know, the real deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's, there's this,
something got lost in memory because skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: weed doesn't really smell like a skunk
when you have it right up in your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like when you're squeezing it
and sniffing it, it doesn't have that same
[SPEAKER_00]: smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like if you have it in a backpack in a
hot car, it's like very skunky because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's this like odor that kind of
evaporates into the ambient air,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think this whole hunt for the
real deal skunk is kind of misguided
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know, like sour diesel,
you have really good sour diesel and you
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a backpack and it gets hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells like a skunk, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think but you take it out and you
squeeze it and you roll a joint and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling it up close, it has more to it
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that, you know, the fuel and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I think people reminisce about the
skunk that they used to have and that
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody has anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really think that's an accurate
way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, gassy weed is skunky
and limey weed is skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, you know, in a certain
circumstance, it's going to smell like a
skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get up close, it's not going to
have that same exact profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a few additional elements,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people think like, no, I want that
real skunk from the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we still have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like sour diesel and the limey OGs
and stuff are skunky weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that people in their memory,
they're kind of misremembering what it
[SPEAKER_00]: really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I don't think there was
ever any thing that was purely skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's always been like some
skunkiness with some other elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that nostalgia and,
you know, the way our olfactory system is
[SPEAKER_00]: tied into our memory has complicated the
way people remember that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, most certainly, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the topic of sort of fabled genetics,
do you have any like old school or special
[SPEAKER_01]: strains in your collection that you're
sort of itching to bust out and do a
[SPEAKER_01]: phenohan or work on in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the headband, we're really,
really trying to make good headband seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of similar to like trying to
make a sour diesel seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to do because there are a lot of
recessive traits and you can breed it and
[SPEAKER_00]: breed it and breed it all different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might never get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we're working on both
trying to make sour diesel or seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: come as close to sour as we can and the
headband as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're just not quite getting there
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so we're working on that and
it's a slow process and it's a lot of like
[SPEAKER_00]: two steps forward, one step back or two
steps back, one step forward, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's just got to work through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm excited to eventually get
back the 707 headband and seed form that
[SPEAKER_00]: we really like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, is that you thinking that
might be sort of like a recreation or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking to do it via a different
genetic pathway?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're trying to start with the
parents that we started with before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like we have the clones and
some seeds that are close, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the diesel diesel Afghani seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're kind of like redoing
processes that we've done in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times you can take the
parents that you think are going to create
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing and just based on, you know,
the random probabilities of all of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't quite get what you wanted out of
it, you know, and or maybe you have some
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that aren't desirable, like a herm
or, you know, some weird structure problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plants or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's so it takes time to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also we're just doing a lot all at
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I run a farm that, you know,
15,000 square feet of light depth and full
[SPEAKER_00]: term and also trying to do all these
breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's we're spread a little bit thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes a long time to get through all
these projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm going to play devil's
advocate here and try to throw a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more work on your plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a plan to do any work with
like some sort of more sativa related
[SPEAKER_01]: lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that's something which,
you know, I might not have been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: spot it, but it wasn't particularly
represented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you would ever do or
you're more sort of just into the indica
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I personally get paranoid when I
smoke sativa dominant stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something with my body
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really agree with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, you know, for me to be good at
breeding, I have to breed things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: appealing to me or I can't make a good
selection and I can't create a product
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can really be proud of and,
you know, put my name on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do kind of focus on the things that I
like and indica's work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, I don't even think the
indica sativa thing really makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are broadleaf plants that have
a sativa type of chemical profile and vice
[SPEAKER_00]: versa, you know, so that whole way of
talking about it doesn't even really make
[SPEAKER_00]: sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do focus on mercy and dominant
terpene profiles, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beta karyophylline might stay away from a
lot of the more sativa dominant stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly my own taste and feeling like
in order to be good at breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to focus on things that are
appealing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I think the market much prefers
gas and mercy and dominant flower too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm not sure that I will focus
much on sativas just because they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: what I would choose to smoke, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that sounds like some good advice
for, you know, people looking to breed,
[SPEAKER_01]: like read the things you're passionate
about that you can discern and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any other sort of
recommendations for people sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: aspiring breeders, maybe looking to start
their own breeding program?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you recommend to them in terms
of how to do things properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: To do only one breeding project at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start by putting a male in with 50
hype clones because you'll create too much
[SPEAKER_00]: work for yourself to hunt through all of
those plants and to find the ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: special that you should continue breeding
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, the royal is a good
example where we started with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, three plants and, you know,
we crossed two of them together and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we crossed those two with the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just by refining that work over,
you know, 15 years or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've found really special stuff that's
very different from the other phenotypes
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever the different profiles that
are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to use a lot of starting
material to find a lot of different things
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lines you're working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, you know, just really thoroughly
hunt through one cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be more rewarding,
I think, for people than it would be to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to, you know, put a male in with the
50 hype clones and then to try to hunt
[SPEAKER_00]: through all of that will take you a really
long time and it'd be really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So focus on one project at a time is my
advice and to be thorough and to take your
[SPEAKER_00]: time doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid advice, solid advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something I wanted to bring up and ask
you was how do you feel slash how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with the sort of variety of various
companies that have been using a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: Mandelbrot's genetics in their work,
probably more notably since his past,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, are you okay with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any issues?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm totally okay with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the more his work gets out there,
the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time I've had issues is when
people are lying and misrepresenting
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships or saying they're doing it
for charity when they're not, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's a good way to do it and a not
so good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just making knockoffs for profit
and you're lying to people about your
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with him, which is a thing
that has happened several times,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't like that and I've spoken
out about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just breeding things that
you like and like maybe making a
[SPEAKER_00]: recreation of his work and you're doing it
with respect for him and the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the work that he put in, I'm totally all
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just the being decent about
it is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sort of the elephant in the room,
but I think people will sort of expect us
[SPEAKER_01]: to touch on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there has been a few releases
from aficionado seeds in the past,
[SPEAKER_01]: which were just sort of straight filial
breedings or just sort of extensions
[SPEAKER_01]: without necessarily new input of genetics
that were done under the aficionado brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has that ever, did Leo make good on the
promises in terms of donating funds
[SPEAKER_01]: towards your nephew and the things that
were sort of said at the time or is that
[SPEAKER_01]: still a contentious sort of?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the example I was
bringing up and I don't like to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff too much, but people ask all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you know, at the Emerald Cup a
few years ago, he put out the oil spill
[SPEAKER_00]: and he said that all the proceeds were
going to charity for my nephew who had had
[SPEAKER_00]: a stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, my brother dies and then
not very much later, his son has a stroke
[SPEAKER_00]: and almost died.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he was life flighted between
hospitals and you know, clinging for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right around that same time,
this guy is selling knockoffs and saying
[SPEAKER_00]: the money is going to charity,
charging $800 a pack for the seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping all the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he gave a really tiny percentage
of it publicly, like through GoFundMe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he probably sold 300 grand worth
of the seeds and he gave a few thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars in a public way to make it look
like, look what we're doing for this sick
[SPEAKER_00]: kid, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was lying and cheating and
promising us that, oh, when he has the
[SPEAKER_00]: money, he's going to give us a bunch more
and never intending to make good on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's not selling seeds that
were you know, my brother's creation that
[SPEAKER_00]: bothers me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the fact that he was lying and
stealing from a sick kid and telling
[SPEAKER_00]: people he was doing charity when he
wasn't, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very long and convoluted story.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did that with the oil spill,
the royal kush, the what he, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is another thing where he called it
the magnum opus, but he made a watered
[SPEAKER_00]: down version of royal kush that hermed and
then he called it my brother's magnum opus
[SPEAKER_00]: and sold it for obscene amounts of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, saying that the money was going to
my family when it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like a slap in the face,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother's actual work was his magnum
opus, not this bullshit that Leo made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's Obama to hear that that's
sort of how that one's played out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we hope your nephew can get
all the funds and help that he's been
[SPEAKER_01]: promised.
[SPEAKER_01]: It raises another question in my mind in
general about the pricing in the retail
[SPEAKER_01]: seed market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And much like many other industries in
this world, you know, there's always a
[SPEAKER_01]: high end scene for things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was wondering, what's your thoughts
on the high end retail market for breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: who do sell, you know, what might be
described as sort of limited releases or
[SPEAKER_01]: just premium prices in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any issues with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think it's sort of akin to like
the premium sneaker market, like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: just always going to be demand for the
high end exclusive sort of stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't have a problem with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't charge that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think two hundred dollars is
the most that you can reasonably charge
[SPEAKER_00]: for a pack of seeds, you know,
and like for that to be justified by the
[SPEAKER_00]: work that you've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time that there is demand
for the most expensive product,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the people that buy Gucci and Louis
Vuitton buy it because it's fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive and it gives them a sense of
status and like they have something that
[SPEAKER_00]: most people can't get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is demand for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a free market where people should
create products that are in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no issue with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it would be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those companies that charge a hundred
dollars for a pack of seeds should also
[SPEAKER_00]: have some offerings that other people can
afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you shouldn't just sell the very
high end stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have limited releases,
maybe of some high end stuff that's
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you should also have some stuff that
most people can afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you shouldn't put out F1s that
are untested in a fancy box and say that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're this coveted, rare, very refined
thing when they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that a lot of the companies that
charge that much are really taking
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of people and selling them an
inferior product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is demand for that boutique,
expensive product that's limited and hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't fault that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the way that some of these
companies have done it isn't super classy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I noticed on your website that you
had a strain called The Real Rosé and it
[SPEAKER_01]: made me wonder, are you able to give us
any more backstory on that one at all?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Shiloh and I were talking about opening
a new brand together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mandelbrot's family heirlooms name was
actually something that he thought up and
[SPEAKER_00]: we were planning on putting out the Rosé
under that label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a few months later, we just
hadn't talked for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they put out the Rosé under Dying
Breeds, you know, and they entered it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cup and they won.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it made this article saying that
they didn't know the actual parentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Rosé.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, like that, the terpium
profile of the Rosé is definitely Royal
[SPEAKER_00]: Cush dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that floral profile is Royal and
they just lied about it and they made this
[SPEAKER_00]: article saying, oh, we don't know what the
parents are, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely felt cheated after all of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting that they would do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember they entered it in the Emerald
Cup and there was a bit of controversy
[SPEAKER_01]: that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I think a lot of people were
sort of expecting that Rosé to win,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it ended up not winning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's, you know, after that
happened, there were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are really well-tuned to the
history of all this stuff and like who saw
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower at the cup, they were selling
eights at their booth at the cup and
[SPEAKER_00]: people knew as soon as they opened those
jars that it was a Royal hybrid,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, so I got immediately afterwards,
people were like, so what's going on with
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, why are they being dishonest?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I was like not fully
aware of what was going on with it at
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after they put out that article
where they said that they didn't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: the parents were, it was, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, look, if people are looking to get
some, some real Rosé seeds, it's not just
[SPEAKER_01]: a pun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also the strain name.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know that you guys have worked
hard on getting some, some distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: out to home growers and just, you know,
hobby growers alike.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where would be the best place for people
to pick up some of your work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my younger brother, Bogie started a
Arun Bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a North Coast novelty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the best place in the U S right
now to get our stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always, you know, like we make
stuff available there before anyone else
[SPEAKER_00]: ever gets it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, you know, if you've had trouble
getting access to our drops in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's both the Emerald mountain legacy,
Instagram and North coast novelties where
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll announce all of that, you know,
before it goes live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in Europe, we have a distributor,
Pearson, Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, you know, they stock all our
stuff and they have a bunch of retailers
[SPEAKER_00]: over there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is this also the same place where
people can watch some of the mini
[SPEAKER_01]: documentary series that was done on
Mandelbrot?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's at emerald mountain legacy.com,
which is like a informational website
[SPEAKER_00]: where we don't do any sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a good place to reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have questions about the genetics,
or about, you know, maybe like how they
[SPEAKER_00]: might perform for you and your environment
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the sales are all done through North
coast novelties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we do a lot of like educational
and like the video series is posted at
[SPEAKER_00]: emerald mountain legacy.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, on the other end of the spectrum,
you know, you've done some collabs,
[SPEAKER_01]: which have been really quite successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one that I think a lot of people
have taken note of is the Royale with
[SPEAKER_01]: cherries, which is not only a collab with
me and Gene, but, you know, a great sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of little play on words from the Pulp
Fiction movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you describe that line to people?
[SPEAKER_01]: And will we be seeing more of it slash any
more collaborations in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one, you know, it's interesting
because a lot of royal crosses come out
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly royal dominant, you know,
where it's like royal with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: the elements of the other thing just
because royal has been bred or inbred for
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a lot of the traits kind of
locked in and they they tend to pass on to
[SPEAKER_00]: the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the royal with cherries, you know,
Jackson does a lot of great work and he
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of has a similar thing going on where
the traits of his stuff are dominant in
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of few where, you know,
you cross royal with something else and it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out actually leaning more towards
the cherry lime made or whatever cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: lime pop than it does the royal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so it's a very cherry and lime
dominant terpene profile, but it has a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the strengths of the royal where,
you know, it's mold resistant and chunky
[SPEAKER_00]: and early finishing and has some gas,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one was really interesting because
it didn't follow the trend of being like
[SPEAKER_00]: royal with a little element of something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cherry and lime dominant and
it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some variation, but they all have
lime and cherry for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your other question, we probably will
be doing more collabs, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to make something new and test it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of us have to approve of how it
comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll be able to do that again and
maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, another one that I was interested
in was you done a collab with HBK,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Chili Verde cross royal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a ton of information about that
one out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe that one for people
who might have a pack and are sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: wondering if they want to pop it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the the flavor like the lavender that
comes through in the Chili Verde has this
[SPEAKER_00]: lingering feeling in your mouth where it's
like you have like candy coating in your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just lingers after you take a puff,
you know, and that's what I found most
[SPEAKER_00]: intriguing about that cross is that it's
got this really nice lingering flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's again, it's one that has traits
of both parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't lean one way or the other,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't yield super well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the plants are a little
finicky with feeding and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the terpene profile is really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice, nice little description there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been interested in the Chili
Verde crosses because for all the sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: critical acclaim it's had, you really
don't see it getting used in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses, but that'll be a cool one for
people to check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next question I had, which was
submitted by one of the listeners,
[SPEAKER_01]: was they were sort of wondering if you
were aware of any differences between the
[SPEAKER_01]: Long Valley Royal Kush, which was put out
by aficionado versus the Royal Kush,
[SPEAKER_01]: and specifically this person said,
you know, I got some of the Long Valley
[SPEAKER_01]: Royal and didn't really feel like it took
in the direction that the Royal Kush was
[SPEAKER_01]: described as.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like there's some pretty big
differences in those releases or they are
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly similar given it's sort of just
line work?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they are very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have some theories about that,
but I don't want to get into the drama of
[SPEAKER_00]: all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd rather not fully answer that one,
but they are different, I'll say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we'll just leave it as,
you know, if you tried the Long Valley
[SPEAKER_01]: Royal and you weren't impressed,
maybe just give the real deal a go and put
[SPEAKER_01]: some faith in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a few more questions before we jump
into the tail end.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strain, which I think probably most
caught my eye on the site was in fact the
[SPEAKER_01]: 47.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sort of interesting because I'm
assuming it's a little bit more special,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit more rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's priced a little differently,
but when you read the description,
[SPEAKER_01]: it sort of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you pitch this to someone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would this maybe be a good option for our
friend in the last question who didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have the best experience with the Long
Valley?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you actually want the original,
authentic Royal Kush, don't go for the 47.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 47 is different, but it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just its own separate thing,
kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some phenotypes that smell like
cantaloupe and it just looks incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the look of it is really special
and it's very early finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not all of them are super gassy,
authentic Royal Kush phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some phenos in there that
are incredibly gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that they're in there with a mix
of that and a more fruity kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: different variation on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as looks, it's one of the best
looking flowers I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like all the different
profiles of it, but there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the gassy, more royal, the authentic
Royal is in there, but it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, you got to hunt through them to find
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do find it, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're wanting all the seeds to
come out gassy, just go with the Royal
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush 9 or 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find more gassy phenos in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one, the couple of phenos that are
really gassy in the 47 are super special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's just kind of more of a
grab bag, but one that you'll be happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you've certainly got me hyped to
grow out some Royal seeds and see what I
[SPEAKER_01]: can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a special line by the sounds of it,
no question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of, I mean, we've kind of
touched on this, but I just want to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: definitive verdict so that the listeners
know for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of all the crosses you've been able to
create since starting Emerald Mountain
[SPEAKER_01]: Legacy, if you could only recommend one to
someone without really knowing much about
[SPEAKER_01]: their preferences, but just something that
you can really stand behind, which of the
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses you've made, would you recommend
to someone?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have to pick one, it would be the
Royal Wedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it kind of checks all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It yields very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has good structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gassy and it's purple and it comes
out consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like there's not a ton of
variation in how they come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for our more recent projects,
that one just across the board really kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of gets everything or, you know,
it covers all the bases, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, but there are different
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my favorite Fino out of everything
I've made is a Royal Limes Fino that's
[SPEAKER_00]: very skunky and it's got that limey gas
skunk kind of thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not all the seeds come out that way,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Royal Wedding, I'd say,
is consistently great and really fits the
[SPEAKER_00]: demand out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sort of as a follow up to that,
given the wedding cake in the lineage,
[SPEAKER_01]: you mentioned that you like sort of being
able to work these hype strands into sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of more well-behaved lines, shall we say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question we got was, do you ever
feel like the brand culture or hype
[SPEAKER_01]: culture sort of affects your breeding and
that there's sort of like a bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure to work with these super new
exotic cookie varieties, which admittedly,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the old school breeders are not
as fond of as, say, the more newer modern
[SPEAKER_01]: enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you ever feel pressured to work with
them or not really?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do, it's just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you want to sell seeds for profit,
unfortunately, you need to cross stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with the hypey in-demand stuff like
cookies and the sherbs and GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I love GMO and I would grow that
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not one that's a good example of
the hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like the look that cookies
and sherb and all this stuff have and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of what the market has come to expect
good flour to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's pretty much all looks
driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like these real dense kind
of triangular geometric shapes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: super frosty and it's just the way they
look that people really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do make hybrids with that stuff
because it's in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you're trying to sell
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to make some that are in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm more passionate about is the
old school stuff like the headbands and
[SPEAKER_00]: the sours and skunkier stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if like if I was just breeding for my
own interests, I would do that all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time and I wouldn't touch any of that
other hypey stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you kind of have to do
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like you have your passion
projects, but you also have stuff that is
[SPEAKER_00]: high demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense, Ben, bringing a balance
to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another thing I wanted to flag,
if listeners haven't seen it already,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's this like fantastic video series
that was sort of made about Mandelbrot's
[SPEAKER_01]: life and a lot of the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it covered a lot of various aspects of
sort of his overall legacy and work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything in that which maybe
didn't get touched on that you were hoping
[SPEAKER_01]: you shed some light on for the public?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, that's a big, big question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't want to go into too much
detail because I like I like the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like just starting to talk about
that stuff and seeing where it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't I'm not really planning how
the next videos we'll make will go right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of just like to play it by ear and
let people say what they want to say about
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, I don't want to I don't want
it to be formulaic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it to be more of like a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the takeaway is that there's
going to be more videos produced in that
[SPEAKER_01]: series and we'll find out even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had planned to do a season
this year, but I have too much on my
[SPEAKER_00]: plate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the GW Smoke Break guys do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think the series they made
with us kind of created a lot of demand
[SPEAKER_00]: for more of that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have, you know, probably a
dozen projects they're working on this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm right now trying to expand my
business into Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm splitting my time between
California and Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's a lot, you know,
so we're taking some time off and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to kind of play it by ear and see
when we can get back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're juggling a lot of balls
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kudos for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the final question before we jump
into the final quick five questions we ask
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone is, what's your thoughts on the
way the market in terms of breeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: selling seeds is sort of moving?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you think Mac's thoughts on
this would have been?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely moving in a direction
that's more focused on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more people are buying seeds to
grow indoors in their their small,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, personal use garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, the commercial growers
that are growing at scale outdoors are
[SPEAKER_00]: having to move more and more towards clone
based cultivation because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the testing requirements you have to
have a lot of product that's all exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, you'd have it's hard to sell
a bunch of small batches that are
[SPEAKER_00]: different that have a different chemical
profile and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot more over the years, it's become
where the outdoor growers are growing from
[SPEAKER_00]: clone more and more because they need that
consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people who are buying seeds are
doing it to find special stuff that they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to run indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe they're they're in a place where
they're there's not a legal clone market
[SPEAKER_00]: and they can't just go out and buy clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're buying seeds because they can
be mailed discreetly to their location
[SPEAKER_00]: where maybe the government's not very
friendly to cannabis or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the landscape has changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be that we sold a lot of seeds
in bulk to farmers in our area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more and more, it's like people in the
UK and all over South America or wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That the only way that they can get
interesting genetics is in seed form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I would like to continue to
focus breeding on stuff that performs well
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors and does well in my local
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the truth is the demand is not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in, you know, what will do well for
people indoors on a smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, you have to cater to
both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's unfortunate that the
outdoor growers who are in the regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: market are not able to continue to grow
from seed and, you know, because seed
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are really strong outdoors and
clones sometimes have problems that seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the way it's all regulated in the new
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of forced us all in the
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have to go along.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that Mack would like that
much, you know, but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, if you could make one sort of
change in the current, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: legalities around it, what would you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, just to give you an example of what
I mean, in the past, we've heard a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people sort of talk about how the one acre
rule that was always proposed before
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization, which has since sort of been
changed a bit, they always felt like that
[SPEAKER_01]: would allow sort of fair competition
between small and big growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any sort of glaring changes you'd
like to make in the laws?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the perfect example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love for the law to actually be
what was promised to the people who voted
[SPEAKER_00]: for 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it definitely said right in
the short paragraph description that large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale farms wouldn't be allowed to operate
until 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then there would be a
conversation about whether huge corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: scaled agriculture would be allowed to
take over, you know, and I really don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think smokers want that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product's going to be worse and it's,
you know, they're going to have shady
[SPEAKER_00]: business practices that choke out small
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That have been doing this their whole
lives and who are better at it and more
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way like we were sold a bill of goods
and it was a scam all along, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was definitely plotted out that they
would have this loophole to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: get like the previous iteration of the
California legalization or adult use law
[SPEAKER_00]: failed because all the people in the
Emerald Triangle showed up to vote against
[SPEAKER_00]: it because they knew it was a corporate
takeover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the next try, they cleverly crafted
this false narrative of like, oh no,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to make sure that small
farmers have a seat at the table,
[SPEAKER_00]: all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was bullshit, you know,
it was definitely a wolf in sheep's
[SPEAKER_00]: clothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we could go back and get that right
and make, you know, small farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive and protected, I would love to
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's unrealistic to expect it,
but I would do it if I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty understandable change that
I think a lot of people could get behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to jump in our final five questions
that we ask everyone who comes on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one being, what is the best or most
memorable single smoke you can recall?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Headband, for me personally, like the
effect, there's something special about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can smoke headband that's like 17%
THC and get way more ripped or way more in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mode that I want to be in from,
you know, like 17% THC, 3% total terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which it doesn't on paper look very
impressive compared to a lot of the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's out there these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from personal use and like the way it
affects me, it's really perfect,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and it doesn't matter that it's
not that potent, it still affects me the
[SPEAKER_00]: way I want it to every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could smoke it exclusively and it would
still get me where I want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, you know, I could go buy
something that's 30% THC and not get that
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's the numbers are not what's
important on paper as far as what affects
[SPEAKER_00]: you the way you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's more complicated than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I guess on the other end of the
spectrum, was there ever a strain where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, everyone was really hyping it up
and just sort of excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you finally tried it,
you were like left a bit disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'd be calling out a breeder
though, if I were to say, oh, I hate this
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do that, but there's
definitely stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I don't think is as good as the
market has made it appear to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't want to be specific
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Diplomatic, I can get behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next one being let's do a desert
island situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're getting dropped off to a desert
island and you can only grow three strains
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, they could be clones or they
could be packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which three are you taking with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say headbands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oil spill and GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: GMO lover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a cookie cross and I have
feelings about it, but I like the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's a lot of our listeners
out there right now who are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: just take the Chem D, you can harvest it
quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have love for the GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next question is the, it's sort of
the same situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dropping, we're doing the island
situation, except this time, rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: you staying there, it's someone else and
you don't really like them that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: What three strains are you going to leave
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack and train wreck and green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what's funny?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I totally get where you're coming
from with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as someone who hasn't been around in
the California region my whole life,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like not burnt out on Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd probably happily take that,
but that's, that's, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel terrible if I smoke that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I feel like climbing out a
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting like how you get these
sort of geographical differences in taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as you've sort of alluded to anywhere
in the Mendo area, you offer someone train
[SPEAKER_01]: wreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just laugh at you, but I'm like,
man, give it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've only had it a few times,
but yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, the geographic element of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So final question for the interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could go back to any place in time,
presumably to collect seeds or a clone,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go anywhere, anytime throughout
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you going?
[SPEAKER_01]: When and what are you grabbing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely I would say the Hindu Kush
mountains or you know, the like India and
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan, you know, the whole region,
I don't know if I could pick a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: area, but the high mountains of
Afghanistan or that general area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, like the Hindu Kush as a
cultivar, I think is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, the, like the wide open land case
that that comes from, I would love to
[SPEAKER_00]: really hunt through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, that's a popular choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of those old Hindu Afghani
sort of genetics are certainly fabled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that pretty much brings us to
the end of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there any comments or shout outs you
wanted to make before we wrap up?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think I'd just like to say,
I really appreciate the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you, you really covered the
entire spectrum of what people ask me
[SPEAKER_00]: about all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a good job kind of boiling it down
and making it interesting for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kudos to you and thank you again for
