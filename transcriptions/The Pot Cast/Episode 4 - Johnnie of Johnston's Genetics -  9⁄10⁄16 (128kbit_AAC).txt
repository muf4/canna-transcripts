[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
The Podcast, a cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_01]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode, as always, was brought to
you by 420 Australia, your premier
[SPEAKER_01]: lifestyle company, as well as Johnston
Genetics, makers of awesome strains such
[SPEAKER_01]: as the Grandma's Sugar Cookies and the
newly released Ron Swanson Courage.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, we're joined by Johnny of
Johnston Genetics, who fills us in on some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the details around Johnston Genetics,
as well as some of his plans for the
[SPEAKER_01]: future and much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okie dokie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big welcome to our guest,
Johnny from Johnston's Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you so much for coming on the
show today.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll just jump straight into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first question I like to ask
everyone growing up, what were some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons you decided to get into cannabis
and what was your first experience with
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it with some friends?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it with your uncle in the backyard?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That goes way back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got into the cannabis industry at a
young age.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earlier than 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember my exact age.
[SPEAKER_02]: Started smoking, just hanging out with
friends as everyone did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was known to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what my dad did growing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it wasn't anything new to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't doing it to rebel.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was kind of the original time of
whenever I had my first instance with
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana, just hanging out with friends,
busted out a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was just like, yeah, let's go for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I fell in love immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I have kind of a hyper mind and it
settled me down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was just amazing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally at that moment, that joint was
life changing for me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you first started growing,
what were some of the first strains you
[SPEAKER_01]: were growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that your dad was already
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did he have kind of like a library
already or were you guys kind of trialing
[SPEAKER_01]: out breeders at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, you know, who were some of the
breeders around at that time?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like when your dad was doing it
or were there no breeders yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: There were breeders, but not in our local
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were kind of, it was extremely
underground.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started in Oklahoma, which is
completely no tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: No tolerance state, zero tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so breeding was not really talked
about among groups of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was done basically back then as a
necessity to have the next round of seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow for the next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we basically had a lot of our,
or my dad had a lot of his old stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know all of the exact sources and
stuff, but he's acquired them over the
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whenever I first started, he didn't
give me anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was me starting out on my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't exactly have like a free gift of
genetics from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But later on I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he picked up seeds from all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: He picked up seeds from Africa,
a lot from Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: He spent 12 years in Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in Middle East, it was basically
that was the real two main locations he
[SPEAKER_02]: acquired from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some through some South American
travel.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he spent 12 years in the Middle East
and Africa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where a lot of my influence
comes from is what his kind of choices
[SPEAKER_02]: were growing up that I watched.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did he kind of work these lines out
himself or were they just kind of run as
[SPEAKER_01]: they were and probably would have been
pretty game changer to have Afghan seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: at that time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm imagining this was probably
20, 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's one of our biggest,
I guess you could say staples that I have
[SPEAKER_02]: in the storage vault is old school Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's I'm going to be breaking that
out very soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: For my next breeding projects in the next
six months or so, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically when he started the seeds,
they were just land race.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, they had he just brought them
back, started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we would just have to like it
would be each year the best that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: selected.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd keep the seeds that we ran from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then every year we progress with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, what generation do you think
they would be at just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like since he's had them probably like,
you know, F 20 or something, or they won't
[SPEAKER_01]: work that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's his health isn't very good anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's he's no longer doing anything
himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when he stopped, they would have
probably been in the teens, possibly at
[SPEAKER_02]: least.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't always grow the exact same thing
every single year, but we make sure to get
[SPEAKER_02]: seed stock of of most things for the next
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of where that love of that
and watching things progress, change,
[SPEAKER_02]: watching the genetics mix with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, from a young age,
that's what inspired me to want to start
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then with the switch of legalization here,
that kind of just gave me the kick in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ass to get it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like you were pretty
self-sufficient for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point did you decide to bring in
kind of, you know, some foreign genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak, maybe some clones from some
other people or, you know, you bought some
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds from some other people or was it
really just working with your own stock
[SPEAKER_01]: until then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I felt like a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't always just smoke what I grow and
I smoke things from other readers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've probably smoked something from every
reader out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have my favorites and my favorite
smokes as a tip of the hat, kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: respect to the breeders that did breed
some of the genetics I've used.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the main reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they bred something that I,
you know, fall in love with, I'll probably
[SPEAKER_02]: be throwing something of mine that I think
would work out well with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, genetics come into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly a show of respect to the other
readers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really started around the
legalization time for here, maybe a year
[SPEAKER_02]: or two before that, you know, because
medically here, it's been, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: quite open for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been working with other genetics
for a while, I guess I could say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, let's talk about some of
your strains because in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost all of them use what I would call
like a unique strain in that like one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the parents is not used by really any
other breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll start off with what I assume is
probably the main stud in your garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: the black sugar berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've found at least eight or 10 or so
crosses that use it as the male.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obviously pretty good in your
opinion, but there's not a lot of info on
[SPEAKER_01]: it online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how would you describe it to
someone who is interested, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like what's your sales pitch for the black
sugar berry as a male?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that one came out, it was pretty
underground when it came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why there wasn't a whole lot of
info out there, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's big winning traits are for the
most part, just nice size colas,
[SPEAKER_02]: good purple hues with a good even base
flavor, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an all around real winner in my
opinion, as far as like production,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was my main focus was to use
that larger bud pattern to add into some
[SPEAKER_02]: of my other favorite genetics to see if I
could push that purple into them is really
[SPEAKER_02]: was one of my big pushes, which a lot of
them did take.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another line that I think is really
interesting of yours is the Paki Valley
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as I know, I mean, I'm probably
wrong, but I can only off the top of my
[SPEAKER_01]: head think of you and two other breeders
who have done a similar project where
[SPEAKER_01]: basically, they work the one line out in
multiple different directions,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like multiple different
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was wondering, what's the
inspiration behind this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, was it like a pre planned idea?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was it just like a happy mistake where,
you know, maybe you pop the first F1s and
[SPEAKER_01]: you found that there were two fairly
different phenotypes and both were
[SPEAKER_01]: standout?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you have a plan from the start and
you knew the Paki Valley was something
[SPEAKER_01]: that was going to be worth digging into?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it really happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you could call it the happy
mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran into two Finos that when I was,
you know, selecting down to my always,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd select down to my best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what makes it to the next
generation for breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I came down to making that choice,
I just couldn't decide between two and I
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't throw one away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just went the two routes with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went number one and number two with the
magenta and the white, as a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how would you describe the two
different lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been able to find some information
that says, you know, I believe it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: magenta is you describe it as a little bit
more of a medicinal line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, how would you describe the two
lines and how they differ from each other?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the magenta would be more along the
I don't know how you'd explain it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicating, it was more heavy in the
medicating field, like heavy indica
[SPEAKER_02]: effect, I guess you could call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really would sit you in your seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: The white was a little more on the
brighter flavor note and not quite so
[SPEAKER_02]: couch lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the the experience of the smoke
between the two just was completely
[SPEAKER_02]: different to me and as was the flavor
profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just went ahead and split them up and
kept running with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that was my real basis for keeping
two going because it was a hard decision
[SPEAKER_02]: to get rid of one or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Painstaking choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've actually had a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep going, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say I've actually had a lot
of people send thank you emails saying
[SPEAKER_02]: that they've ran both and they they
appreciated the flavor effect of one more
[SPEAKER_02]: than the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said thank you for giving them
the option of both.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so, you know, because at first I
was kind of self battle whether I was
[SPEAKER_02]: going to do that or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a good choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's something unique and
something that needs to be done more,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I definitely agree that we're at
least in my mind, it seems like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's this seesaw,
so to speak, of breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and in my mind,
there's kind of like flavor on one end of
[SPEAKER_01]: it and yield and potency on the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I always tend to think,
you know, you're always kind of trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: balance it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why try to hit both if you can make two
that kind of sit well at either end?
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings up kind of my next question
a little bit tied into that on the pro the
[SPEAKER_01]: website strain finder dot com or seed
finder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it says that the packie you run
was from World of Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, first of all,
is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that seemed a little odd to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then two, how does a site like that
interact with a breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they request the information from you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've found that like a lot of
their stuff is wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tend to think that maybe they scout
the information themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why the errors are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have touched base with me on a couple
of my things, because kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: as you say, I have several things that are
very underground, not much info on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have touched base with me on a few
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But and actually the World of Seeds deal
is correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did have a good amount of World of
Seeds, Packie Valley that was gifted to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ran a good number of them and I
found a couple that I liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where that comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe so.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do believe it was World of Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually had some alright success
with World of Seeds myself, but I've heard
[SPEAKER_01]: some conflicting reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also just thought, given what you
said earlier about the Afghan land race
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, maybe it had been stuff you doubted
may be collected.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't want to take credit from
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will say, in all honesty,
I ran a good number of seeds to find the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that I found.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had I just had like a 10 pack and popped
them, I probably would have came out with
[SPEAKER_02]: a complaint, but I ran more than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but I did find what I consider to be
some good winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, you know, with numbers,
you'll you'll find winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on to what I think is maybe kind of
your new main breeding project,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pine tar Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, sorry, that was it was used in the
making of the Ron Swanson.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to the start, the pine tar Kush
was made by Tom Hill.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a strain which has actually been
quite in demand for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have been calling for a
Tresurgence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that part of the inspiration for you
working it into the Ron Swanson line?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, did you think to yourself,
I'm going to make this new strain and I
[SPEAKER_01]: want the pine tar Kush to be a part of it
because there's certain traits that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to put into this new stud,
for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there I wasn't aware that there was
very much of a movement going on with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a favorite of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had been growing it for a couple of
years just for personal smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I at some point, I just decided,
hey, and I well, I started running
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors instead of indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was getting some very large plants,
nine, ten feet tall on average,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, several feet around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wanted to take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a full bushiness where,
you know, but all the way down the branch,
[SPEAKER_02]: very tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I wanted to take it with a couple
of my other strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did several breedings with it,
only a couple were released.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just really enjoyed it personally as
a smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was one of my kind of personal
pushes in my genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do about 50-50, half of what I would
like to see bred and half of kind of what
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the industry would like to see
bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like forcing people upon only what
the strains that I would like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to give a good variance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in your mind, did you just kind of
think that the black sugar berry,
[SPEAKER_01]: given how you mentioned earlier that it
adds those nice colors, did you think that
[SPEAKER_01]: would just kind of complement the pine tar
or was it for different reasons you chose
[SPEAKER_01]: the black sugar berry to mate with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was trying to make a super plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that the pine tar grew for me
consistently for a couple of years and my
[SPEAKER_02]: love for the black sugar berry,
I knew that they would work well together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just didn't intend to, I guess I didn't
know that I would like the Ron Swanson as
[SPEAKER_02]: much as I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turned out to be a long term personal
favorite of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe that to anyone who
is interested in just the pure Ron
[SPEAKER_01]: Swanson?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron Swanson by itself, it tends to grow
very much like the pine tar with a heavier
[SPEAKER_02]: lemon lime influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's whereas the fennel I was running of
the pine tar was very floral.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a, I don't, you know, you
understand floral flavor palette,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very, very floral.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it kind of shocked me that it came
out so lemon, lemon lime being bred with
[SPEAKER_02]: the black sugar berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it, it translates real well pure Ron
Swanson.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you ever run live resin,
it's one of the most flavorful live resins
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the case of maybe the Ron Swanson or
just any, any of your own projects where
[SPEAKER_01]: you feel they really stand out,
have you ever considered the idea of maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: doing like a deeper breeding project,
maybe, maybe a back cross or taking
[SPEAKER_01]: something to the F2, F3, or do you think
that a lot of your Australians are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: more suited as F1s?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually I don't post a lot of my
old breeding, but most of my stuff when
[SPEAKER_02]: it's released is F2 or F3.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, there are, there have been a few that
have been F1 breedings, but for the most
[SPEAKER_02]: part they are F2 or F3s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am actually about to start an F1 only
project that will allow people with a
[SPEAKER_02]: wider variety of options, you know,
like that kind of lottery ticket seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: as some refer to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they would be sold at a discounted
rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm trying to get people that
where they can feel like they have
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's a little more special
than other people may have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's the whole reason I do the
limited edition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could run a lot more seeds and sell a
lot more seeds, but I think when,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, people can trade cuts of
something that's a little rarer,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that adds a little more,
I don't know, prestige to the strains
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves, every breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can look at examples from say
the Brothers Grimm with Apollo 11 and 13,
[SPEAKER_01]: where, you know, I think they're pretty
good examples of how, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the limited stock has kind of added to the
mystique of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting you say that about how
they're F2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you, do you choose to not list on
because, you know, like a lot of companies
[SPEAKER_01]: will say, you know, these are F2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen that on any of your
packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you purposely choose not to do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I guess I've never considered it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fairly old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have designers that do most of the
packaging design for me and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I basically send them a list of what I
want on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that never has been a part of what
I've sent them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to be redoing my packaging soon
though, which would probably include what
[SPEAKER_02]: generation it would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it would be, it'd be cool to
include that because it kind of makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense that you said they were F2s,
F3s, because I've always noticed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot of consistency with your
stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the next question would be though,
in terms of that limited edition and
[SPEAKER_01]: limited releases, back to one of my
favorite strains from you, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's such a mouthful, the granddaddy
platinum perp berry cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one that came out initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've seen it on one other seed
banks since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you said, you don't really restock
it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we see this with your strains,
is that due to the fact that, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are just pretty much following that
limited edition route or maybe some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them you just later on decided,
oh, look, that strain doesn't really stand
[SPEAKER_01]: up to some of the others we've got now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to redo it for that reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mixture of both actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives me, it doesn't lock me into
something that I don't feel confident
[SPEAKER_02]: about breeding in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people like it, then they had to change
it while it was limited edition.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also gives me time and room to work
on something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: But along with this F1 line that I'll be
coming out with in the near future,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also going to be coming out with a
classics line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which will be the granddaddy platinum perp
berry cookies, grandma's sugar cookies,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a few other strains that have been
requested heavily for returns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those will be coming back out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's part, you know, then those will
be less of a limited edition release.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll still be numbered.
[SPEAKER_02]: As of right now, I limit everything no
matter, no matter the strain, I won't sell
[SPEAKER_02]: more than 250.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 packs of a strain on the classic line
and the F1 line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will probably both allow those to be 500
packs maximum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll still be limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just not quite as limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little more available for maybe the
people who are after it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's part of my,
my plan is, you know, there's certain
[SPEAKER_02]: people that want say granddaddy platinum
perp berry cookies and known and trusted
[SPEAKER_02]: strain, but it's not available to,
you know, but it, it, it'll be,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the future within the year,
probably I'll be dropping and actually
[SPEAKER_02]: another drop of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, moving on, you've got your CBD
diesel and this is kind of a broader topic
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you were creating your CBD diesel,
obviously you were probably thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: something along the lines of I would like
to make a CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what type of lab testing goes into the
making of a CBD strain or if there was
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't any, how much kind of testing on
the butt itself do you have to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've, as much as people might kind
of cringe at this idea, I have spoken to a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder before who said they didn't use a
lot of lab testing to make their CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they did at the very last step,
but up until that point, they had just
[SPEAKER_01]: gone on kind of, you know, anecdotal,
um, results from people of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what, what is the most medicinal in your
opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said that they kind of got to a
good point using that method.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people would kind of disagree
and say, no, you should be using lab tests
[SPEAKER_01]: every step of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how did your project work?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what kind of side of that
argument do you fall on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't really have an argument there,
but I do know where I lie as in the
[SPEAKER_02]: testing for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I run final stage, uh, tested flower
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I start with known genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I work with a few dispensaries here
that we're trying to put out, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine for the patients and they give me
a cut of something that they have that
[SPEAKER_02]: they know what it tests at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I work with it to alter it,
change it for what we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, send it back to be tested,
uh, you know, multiple batches,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, to find out which Fino.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we keep progressing on from
there, um, I've actually been working
[SPEAKER_02]: with, uh, a guy here in town.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he wants me to call him
out by name and I don't have permission
[SPEAKER_02]: yet, so I'm not going to, but,
uh, he's got an extremely high,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, CBD, extremely low THC, uh,
of a can of tonic that I'm working with,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, that I really think is going to put
out some good medicine for the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so what's your kind of,
um, your dream for your CBD lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you just want to make a really good CBD
strain and kind of leave it there for
[SPEAKER_01]: people to do what they want with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you thinking, no, there's a
specific kind of illness I'm actually
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to target.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I might refine it towards that,
for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, I, I'm actually the reason I
wanted to get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, if I had my dream come true,
I'd be able to come up with a,
[SPEAKER_02]: an amazing CBD strain or multiple strains,
some high THCV strains, something,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, that will be free to, to anyone that
needs it, uh, any dispensary that wants to
[SPEAKER_02]: provide it.
[SPEAKER_02]: To a patient, any grower that wants to
grow it for themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's the true medicine side of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to be a pharmaceutical
company ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I want to be a helper of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so if that could ever be free to the
people, whether it's from me or other
[SPEAKER_02]: growers or whoever, that would,
that would be my dream for the CBD field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my CBD projects as of now have
basically been to start my working in it
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of inspire some of the other
people around me that, Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not after, you know, 35% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that can be a goal, but there's other
stuff that you can be doing also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, your, your Mayday OG, this is an
interesting one to me because a few people
[SPEAKER_01]: have done a similar route to you where
they decide to leave one of the parents,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, kind of non-documented, you know,
like they're, they're not going to fully
[SPEAKER_01]: release the details of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What in your mind is the reason for doing
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: It obviously adds a bit of mystique.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think in my mind, the first
person who comes to mind is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cookie fan with the Girl Scout
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the most notable one where
we don't know the full genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that it's a little bit of a
marketing move?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, I think it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but is it maybe something else for
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe you don't quite know the
father.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the reason for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's actually like, kind of a,
it was a marketing move, but in a way that
[SPEAKER_02]: you wouldn't think, um, there have been
several genetics that have been,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, swindled from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll call it, I won't call people thieves
on that, but, um, and I don't want them
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the credit locally to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I just, I sometimes keep certain
things secret to not blow up the strain
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're holding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's the, it's not for my
marketing, it's for like anti-marketing to
[SPEAKER_02]: the people who have my strains that
shouldn't have them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, for certain, I have a few ones that I
didn't want out there and they're out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just don't give them the credit so
they don't, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that kind of brings us to an
interesting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your thoughts on sharing of
genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess more specifically for someone
who buys your genetics, maybe even a
[SPEAKER_01]: future breeder, what, what would be your
kind of, uh, your protocol or your,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, your recommendation for them for
using yours or someone else's strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that as long as they ask you
first, you know, like, Hey, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make this strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think, nah, they don't even need
to ask or, you know, what's your thoughts
[SPEAKER_01]: on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think asking is polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but people are going to do what they
want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as like, I was going to be,
uh, kind of a smart ass and answer your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your protocol call question.
[SPEAKER_02]: All they got to do is put it in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all they have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like I said, asking's polite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it when people ask me and I
feel honored when somebody feels like
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding with my stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm never pissed about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, there's nothing but love
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we're all just working to try to make
it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've spoken to, um, another breeder
before and they said, Oh, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: people should, should try to, make it
their own in a way, you know, like if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to breed with my work,
take it to the F2 first and try to refine
[SPEAKER_01]: a characteristic you like about it first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got more of a claim to say
that, you know, like this is my strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually done, you know, like take it
to the F2 and then use it to make your new
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think like, no, if someone just
wants to use my strain straight from the
[SPEAKER_01]: generation, they get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I agree with what you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think putting work into it is,
is part of paying the dues and calling
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if you just throw pollen on a plant,
you successfully bred something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I wouldn't call that breeding yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, put in a little,
put in a few grows, get it stabilized a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit in what direction you want and
then let people know about it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so people shouldn't announce the,
the new best breeder in the world when
[SPEAKER_01]: they've made their first F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sure that must get on the mind of a
lot of breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be really annoying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nowadays just more than ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, I remember when you could count the
breeders out there on two hands,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, uh, now there's unique pages on
the internet to list the breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you, sorry, go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, how do you manage to
kind of stay relevant in the industry in
[SPEAKER_01]: your mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you just take the approach of,
I'll let my work speak for itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: or do you feel that as you kind of
reference, there are just so many people
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's kind of hard to get lost in the
sea of, you know, marketing almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is required these days
for a breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think, you know, as you mentioned
before the interview, do you think having
[SPEAKER_01]: a social media presence is like a good or
a bad?
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad thing or what do you think these days
in 2016?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I wish that I could be better at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I don't get on the internet much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't surf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I recently figured out what a meme
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I'm not real big on the internet
stuff, uh, but, and I'm going to work on
[SPEAKER_02]: at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's something that I owe to the,
the other growers, the people that want
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge about my strains that,
you know, connect with the fan base.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I, I've got to get better at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, posting pictures is not that hard,
uh, and answering people's questions is
[SPEAKER_02]: not that hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to get better at it,
but in this day and time it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's almost a necessity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I could,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not here for money or fame or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm here, uh, as a behind the scenes
breeder that is, you know, doing the real
[SPEAKER_02]: work in my mind, uh, to get this industry
headed towards, towards a even more
[SPEAKER_02]: positive progression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you like to go to, you know,
like the cups and the events and to meet
[SPEAKER_01]: the guests or do you think, oh,
that's something I'd like to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't do it quite yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I go, um, we've, we've had a couple
booths, uh, at the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't competed yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know, call it nerves or,
uh, not wanting to be disappointed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I haven't competed yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I'm, I'm hoping that whenever I
throw something in, I'll get a cut my
[SPEAKER_02]: first go around, but I highly doubt that,
uh, that would make me feel good though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh no, you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I enjoy meeting the fans, the
customers, the growers, uh, people that
[SPEAKER_02]: come up to the booth and don't buy
anything and talk for 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some of my favorite people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I am not there for sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm there to meet people and hang out with
people with light minds, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually, I was going to say I've
spoken to, um, uh, similarly, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: in, in these stories, they're all the same
breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't have a, their name to give
out, but, um, they, they were saying that
[SPEAKER_01]: winning a cup as a breeder is not the be
all end all because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the, the cut that wins a cup,
it could just be like a one in a million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that strain could be garbage overall,
but like that one bean was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think they were kind of saying as a
breeder, yeah, it's, it's not the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: reflection of your skills as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I haven't competed or at least
to a small extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I want to pay my dues in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are like, who's this new
guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we're not actually that new.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just new to the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same scene, I guess you could say,
um, we're pretty leery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we came from a zero tolerance
state and you know, over a decade ago
[SPEAKER_02]: though, I moved to Colorado and that's
kind of opened my mind and opened the
[SPEAKER_02]: doors, uh, to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was, um, what was it like to
transition to a full-time breeder as your
[SPEAKER_01]: job, especially, I guess, when it,
when you're in that legal environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, was there like kind of a
defining moment where you just thought,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, now is the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you just kind of stumble into it?
[SPEAKER_02]: There, there was, uh, well, I guess it's a
mixture of both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember breeding, uh, my first
personal, like for me growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, I probably like 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started, um, I'm now 34.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that was when I started off on my
own.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, sorry, I'm smoking a blunt right now
and I totally got sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically in between, uh, working,
I decided, Hey, I could start now and
[SPEAKER_02]: start putting my full attention to this
and really kind of make something not even
[SPEAKER_02]: for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured, you know, it could be something
for my children as, as the U S kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: started changing its laws and things
started opening up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured it might be good to put my name
out there as like, Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is what we've been doing for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're ready to announce it and be out in
the industry with everyone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a moment and that was basically
when everyone's seen everything starting
[SPEAKER_02]: to come online.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, I decided like, Hey,
it's just time to put your name out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and I was going through a lot of
flack from family, from friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was like, man, you're going to
get arrested.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you know, somebody's got to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to let everyone know this is the,
you know, what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have you ever had any, um,
run ins with the law after that point,
[SPEAKER_01]: like after the, you know, like the,
it kind of looked like things were
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming less and less, uh, strict,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've, I've not had any, uh,
altercations or issues at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and where I'm at locally though,
things are pretty relaxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Colorado's very relaxed on the
marijuana scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as you mind your P's and Q's
and do what the state tells you to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's, you know, nothing to fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at the Johnston farm, are you guys
organic or synthetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's your reasons behind that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well through at our, at our location,
it's organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we do have other growers that grow
by other means, um, everything from,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, everything from aeroponics,
hydroponics, uh, and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I've seen my strains tested
locally, you know, amongst my grower
[SPEAKER_02]: friends, uh, before they hit the market,
I see what they do on almost like every
[SPEAKER_02]: setup with every growing, uh, feeding
schedule you could imagine almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which one do you think, um,
do your plants come out the best in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think it's maybe a grower by
grower basis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would probably say by grower basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend growers when they ask me what
nutrient line to grow with, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I ask them whatever they're comfortable
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's the main thing, having
experience with the line or knowing the
[SPEAKER_02]: line and knowing how to run it,
uh, that's going to give you the best
[SPEAKER_02]: success.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen amazing buds grown every method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my personal favorite is organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, including, uh, insecticides
that no insecticides, uh, my seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, even though they would be an
expensive treat, uh, I welcome people to
[SPEAKER_02]: pop a pack in their mouth and chew them up
and eat them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're quite healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's the first time I've ever heard
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my uncle maintains his defense will
always be that it's, uh, it's bird feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually years and years ago,
I started a thing, uh, on a, I think it
[SPEAKER_02]: was on a UK chat form, uh, that I was on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started something called operation
bird drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just promoting everyone to put
their seeds, whatever spare seeds they had
[SPEAKER_02]: in their bird feeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if everyone did that,
uh, could you imagine what the wild
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana, uh, population would be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you couldn't, you couldn't have
something that was, uh, you couldn't make
[SPEAKER_02]: it illegal if it was on every street
corner, literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd struggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, uh, pot plants all up and down my
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so just going back to that point you
made about, you know, no insecticides,
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping it nice and healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever noticed, um, a difference in
the quality of seeds produced from a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that is say treated, you know,
organically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really healthy the way you do it versus
say maybe one that's not grown with the
[SPEAKER_01]: same love, you know, not the same
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, have you ever noticed that the seeds
maybe from yours come out better or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: worse than the other, you know,
the less well maintained plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have, uh, and I can't say specifically,
but comparing my seeds, my average seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: to a multitude of other, uh, genetic
company seeds, uh, I see a size difference
[SPEAKER_02]: and that to me speaks for the health of
the seed, you know, uh, a teeny teeny tiny
[SPEAKER_02]: seed that's not well colored to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just not as healthy as a
big fat plum, you know, properly colored
[SPEAKER_02]: seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if that's coming from use
of chemicals or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I can't really say,
but I do see a size difference between
[SPEAKER_02]: mine and some other companies,
not all other companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there are definitely some good
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, recently we've seen that there's a
bit of a crowd mentality in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: hating on blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you're pretty familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what, what do you think about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you think about the idea of
like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's blue dream hate today, but like,
what will it be tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I ask this is because,
you know, you breed with the Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies and I'm a firm believer that one
day Girl Scout cookies will be on that
[SPEAKER_01]: bandwagon with blue dream or maybe blue
dream won't be on it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: People will be hating on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that's already started?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that gets real big, uh,
starts to get too much positive attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone out there is going to speak out
and bring some negative attention towards
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then mob mentality, you know,
somebody's always going to be there to
[SPEAKER_02]: jump on the bandwagon.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really all it is in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you just kind of disregard that when
you're breeding and like, so like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess maybe the bigger question is,
are you not scared to breed with certain
[SPEAKER_01]: strains based on maybe how they'll be
perceived in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you just like, nah, if it's good
today, I'm going to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, the only things that I have like
steered clear from are some, some strains
[SPEAKER_02]: that have some kind of like outrageous
names or kind of names that I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's the only thing I've stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, not because of people's views on what
the strain will be now or in the future
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by when you say the names of strains,
you means like maybe the more,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, hard drug referenced ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to name them out cause I
don't want to call no one out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, I think we all know what you're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to keep a positive vibe or,
you know, or at least a, not a negative
[SPEAKER_02]: vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, like the names, the name with the
strain carries a little bit of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to call it karma,
but you know, it's the name associated
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want something to have that
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you feel about people who make
F1s giving the strains names before
[SPEAKER_01]: they've even kind of grown them out?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess this maybe ties into a breeder
type of question, but if you're a breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: and you make a new F1 and you're just
giving it out to your friends straight
[SPEAKER_01]: away, you haven't even tested it yourself
and you, giving it this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: some crazy, you know, purple spaceship or,
you know, just some, some crazy name or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that that's like a bit of a
misservice to the people who like have
[SPEAKER_01]: done the work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in my opinion, if you're just goofing
around and you make an F1, I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: you should really name it until you've
like, you know, like I think a name should
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of reflect some of the
characteristics of the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you think the same or do you
think like, nah, you might just have a
[SPEAKER_01]: hunch before you've even grown it out and
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, especially like you mentioned,
you may name something this cool ass name
[SPEAKER_02]: that, and now you put it paired with this
stupid plant that you grew, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: and now that cool name's taken,
you know, you should have saved that for a
[SPEAKER_02]: cooler plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So save the cool names, wait till you know
it's a legit plant and then give it its
[SPEAKER_02]: bad ass name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so if we looked at, um, uh,
a typical Johnston breeding project,
[SPEAKER_01]: what would you list as in, and this might
be a hard one in, in order of priority,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are the traits you're breeding for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you, do you value, you know,
flavor as the utmost priority or potency
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, bag appeal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where, how do you kind of rate these
traits in terms of what you're aiming for?
[SPEAKER_02]: I always throw one in that my number one
is one that I never hear anyone name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The structure of the plant itself,
uh, is my number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, having a healthy plant body,
uh, is my first that that's what I look
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once, once I have that, I look for,
uh, like you say, that Holy Trinity of
[SPEAKER_02]: like flavor potency yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's a hard one to balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those three obviously come right there
in second, third and fourth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my favorite though would be taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor is number one for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, um, potency would be second and yield
would be a third in that order of those
[SPEAKER_02]: three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so that's basically how I judge
all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, certain strains, uh, they get
restructured in that, in the priority
[SPEAKER_02]: order there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly for like medical stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as like a bit of a follow-up,
do you think that kind of how I mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier with that kind of seesaw analogy,
do you think you always are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: trading off some traits for the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think it is possible to kind of
get that the trifecta in one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you do, it's very much like a one in
a million.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, you can find that perfect one,
uh, or what will be right then at that
[SPEAKER_02]: moment seem perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but, uh, for the most part,
the plus percent of the time it's a seesaw
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you say, you're, you're giving and
taking, um, but you will find every once
[SPEAKER_02]: in a while that one plant that just,
uh, even amongst all its peers,
[SPEAKER_02]: it tastes better, yields better,
you know, affects better everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you will find some, but it's rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of testing do you like to do on
a strain ideally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what, you know, like what type of
numbers would you ideally like to run
[SPEAKER_01]: before you're confident a strain can go to
market?
[SPEAKER_02]: At least a hundred, uh, at least,
at least a hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sometimes, uh, I don't get happy with
my breeding project and I start over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've, I've had to run things,
you know, over and over redo my breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: to a different, you know, uh, and start
over, throw the seeds away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't let them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and so sometimes for one strain to get
out there, it'll be a lot more than a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be three or 400 that I've ran to
get that strain going and out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during this stage where you've got
these nice big numbers, is that where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're also potentially looking to maybe
find a male for future breeding projects
[SPEAKER_01]: or is that a different project and maybe
even more numbers than a hundred?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, in the hundred, I look for both always
of any plant, uh, any planning of any
[SPEAKER_02]: strain that I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look for a winter male and a winter
female, or at least even a few,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, but I'm sourcing down in the
end result to one or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I do always search for the males
while I'm running numbers with the
[SPEAKER_02]: females.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they're sexed separately,
I don't want people to get confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so what's it like for you as kind
of, uh, you know, I'm not going to say a
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller breeder, but maybe as you,
a lesser known breeder, what's it like for
[SPEAKER_01]: you to interact with the big seed banks?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously your gear is on
attitude, which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: How, what was that process like to get on
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of breeders I speak to say
it's actually harder than you'd think to
[SPEAKER_01]: get on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you seem to have gotten over that
hurdle.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it like for you to interact with
the seed banks and the distributors and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all of that behind the end of
the seed business?
[SPEAKER_02]: In a short word, weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's all new to me, but it's,
it was, it all came real fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, uh, started, uh, giving seeds away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like I said, I'm not, I wasn't ever
there for the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even expect to gain the attention
that I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I was just doing what I wanted to do
and giving people seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people were asking me how,
how they buy my seed and I didn't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: avenues to send them to, uh, I didn't even
have any weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I told them, well, if, if there's a
demand for it, hit your seed banks up and
[SPEAKER_02]: ask them to hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the end, uh, and quite quickly,
actually several seed banks, including
[SPEAKER_02]: attitude were contacting me saying,
how do we carry your gear?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and then I, we just, you know,
we had to work out the business side of
[SPEAKER_02]: things, but well, as far as dealing with
the distributors and stuff, they,
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone contacted me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would be your advice for someone
who's in a similar position to what you
[SPEAKER_01]: were before you were selling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you just say, yeah, just get your
stuff out there, get a good name and ask
[SPEAKER_01]: people to hit up the, uh, the banks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bill, you know, uh, pay some dues first,
get some credit to your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, number one, don't,
don't be in there just to try to get on
[SPEAKER_02]: attitude, to try to make some money and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in my opinion, karma will catch
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will, you know, things won't work out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something will trip up along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, just do what you like doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, if you really want to be a
breeder, cause that's a long time
[SPEAKER_02]: consuming thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got to be very patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's, you know, just stick with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put in the work, the work will
show, you know, people want to grow those
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody else doesn't have the time to
do, uh, all that work to try to get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, quality seeds for other people
to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just going back to one of the points,
um, we spoke about earlier, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, F1 seeds being the kind
of, you know, this, uh, lottery idea of a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: A fairly well-known breeder made a
statement at a breeding panel a few years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago and basically said, uh, we make F1s
because that's what the market dictates.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really sounds like it doesn't sound
entirely true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's the truth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think people want F1s?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I always say to people, you know,
a clone only isn't three different
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one, you know, so right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I agree a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, stability is king.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there is a place in the market for F1s
now because people do want something
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I decided that here in the
future, I'm going to be coming out with a
[SPEAKER_02]: F1 specific, uh, line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that stability is king though.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the work that the breeders put in to,
to make, you know, the strains come out
[SPEAKER_02]: the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's that's what really shows a
breeder's skill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and gives, gets my appreciation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There there's some breeders out there that
have put in many years of hard work to
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve the stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so to say that only F1s is that all
that people need that almost like
[SPEAKER_02]: discredits all the years of the,
like the founding fathers of breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what would be one of your little
tips or tricks you're willing to share for
[SPEAKER_01]: your selection?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you're looking for a male,
what's one of your, your go-to techniques?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people, they,
they love to go to their stem rub.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what's, what's one of your tips for
all our viewers on how to pick a good
[SPEAKER_01]: male?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the stem rub is, you know,
classic, but in my opinion, also generic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, I look for like, it's hard to
explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like sense the plant and look at
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I look at the plant as a whole,
how is its flower production?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, how's its flower production?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the density of its clusters,
uh, the structure of the plant as a whole,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, like robustness of, of the individual
branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I look for, you know, what you would
picture in a male of any breeding program
[SPEAKER_02]: of other animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look for a good stud, a healthy,
uh, big robust, uh, um, for its,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, strain profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, smells can be varied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I, I trust usually with what I'm
working with, I kind of know the smell
[SPEAKER_02]: profile with what I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I'm, for my breedings, I'm looking
at its structure a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of on an idea you just picked up
on is breeding a art or a science to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, like sort of put it in,
you know, the, the most extreme terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think a robot with a set of,
um, traits to look at would be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed as well as a human?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think, no, there's always that,
that kind of, that hunch, that vibe,
[SPEAKER_01]: which makes maybe a breeder, the
difference between a good and a great
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think a robot would be able to
come close.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would be able to grow a plant,
but they wouldn't have the same love
[SPEAKER_02]: connection where you could feel what,
what the plant needs, what the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, uh, you could see capabilities
in plants that, uh, a robot wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to, um, there's no connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no love, uh, with a machine like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I definitely feel a deep connection
with all my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I, I, for me personally,
it's a, got a huge art form to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: or at least some form of connection
between the grower or breeder,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you feel about, um, kind of
these, I don't know, I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the case in America, but in Australia,
for example, there's proposals of having
[SPEAKER_01]: these really big kind of, you know,
um, almost like your tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: conglomerates, like your Philip Morrisons
would be the ones owning it and operating
[SPEAKER_01]: these big warehouses, producing the
medical weed for the Australian market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think in that situation where
you've say got, you know, one grower
[SPEAKER_01]: looking after a thousand plants,
you know, obviously they can't give the
[SPEAKER_01]: love to each plant that you would be able
to on a smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that that would really impact
the, uh, the quality or do you think that
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end of the day, it may be a little
bit, um, you know, like it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: impact it as much as you might think to be
looking after tons of plants and to not be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to give them that little bit of extra
love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think when that starts,
cause it will start at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that the people that are doing
it will have enough money to figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: the systems to run it well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they won't have the connections with
the plants because the numbers are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a commercial product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't be like, uh, what is in Colorado
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more like a craft product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a micro brew of beers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, theirs will be the, you know,
the natural light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, sorry, go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was just going to say,
um, so with the, just kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just spurred the idea, the natural
light, you know, how do you feel indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: rates to outdoor in terms of the medicinal
quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's that time of the year where
me personally, I'm seeing Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: flooded with pictures of how outdoor is
better than indoor, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't really care for the
debate myself, but do you think it is just
[SPEAKER_01]: like a, a tit for tat thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think there is a legitimate
argument to be had?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything has its pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, with outdoor, you, you can have a
longer season as far as one individual
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and have the right amount of light
and space for it to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but indoors, you, you can have a more
isolated controlled environment and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can do things out doors that you can't do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so they both have their pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I do, I appreciate both.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say that I like one better than
the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a lot of work indoors, um,
but I also have greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, we, we appreciate both.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you just have, you have different
perks and different downfalls for each
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we often hear people talk about,
um, this idea of how we've hybridized
[SPEAKER_01]: strains too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to go back to our land race roots
and we need to, you know, start fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: This idea has been around for ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, do you, and you, you kind of
referenced earlier that you're going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the general mainstream will
actually do it though?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everyone always talks about it,
but no one ever actually does it or so it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that we will just keep
hybridizing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it'll stay getting more and
more hybridized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and then at some point the land races
will be looked at as a prized possession.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't think that most, you know,
the profitable breeding, uh, companies out
[SPEAKER_02]: there are looking at restarting with new
land races and taking up parts of their
[SPEAKER_02]: grow for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I don't think it is that profitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's something I'm going to be
doing and look forward to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I go eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I go back to my roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watch black and white movies all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I have more appreciation for the
old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I think, uh, it'll be good to go
back to the roots of some of the old
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics that I have and bring them back
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people like some of the old
school smokes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get people all the time saying,
you know, where's the old weed at?
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff's too strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not, that's not me personally,
but some of the old timers say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, why are we going to try to,
you know, not grow for a certain group of
[SPEAKER_02]: people that still want something that used
to bring them back to that era of thought?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've actually thought about this
topic a little bit myself and I on a
[SPEAKER_01]: personal note, I think that, um,
whether it's consciously or subconsciously
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, the, the brand TGA seeds,
I think they are kind of, um, filling that
[SPEAKER_01]: niche in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, it's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people's opinions
that their weed isn't the most potent,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's really flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can kind of, you know,
like smoke a bit more of it without
[SPEAKER_01]: getting knocked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's interesting that we
are seeing that the rise of, I think it is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably subconscious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consciously in their case, but,
um, you know, like breeders filling quite
[SPEAKER_01]: specific niches and maybe not even
realizing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that's the way that, you know,
everything works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything finds a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, every puzzle has its place or every
puzzle piece has its place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, whether it knows it goes there or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but as far as me, I, I try to make a
lot of my moves and breeds, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: intentional, whether they all,
uh, come across that way, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, but I try, um, and, and on you'll see
here soon, because everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, I will be breeding except for the F1
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything will have an average,
uh, percentages for its potency on the,
[SPEAKER_02]: on the seed package.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, cause I'm doing, everything is getting
heavily tested now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so you'll see some here in the future
that will probably be lower percentage
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers and that will be on purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be in, uh, in reminiscence of the
old school strains because some of them
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't going to be that high and I'm going
to bring them up to what I can,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm not going to try to exclude the
old school traits that they had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so you're stuck on sour is a new
strain you've got and that uses the sour
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the other, you know,
clone only slash elite clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we spoke about the pine tar
course earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the other clones out
there that you would love to work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, in breeding projects, you know,
like you consider them to be quite good
[SPEAKER_01]: and worth working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's a hard one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there's a few that my buddies have,
uh, that are just old unknown genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call them whatever, but they're not,
you know, anything known.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just stuff they've ran for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there's a Cindy, Cindy 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, clone locally that, uh, I had for a
moment and I didn't read to it and I lost
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, you know how it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I never got around to breeding it
and I'll still want to, so I'm gonna get
[SPEAKER_02]: back to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then there's a lime Chernobyl cut
around locally that I'm about to start
[SPEAKER_02]: working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, uh, slime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the, what's that you talking about
slime?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I'm not, I'm not real up to date
on all the, uh, I think that's what people
[SPEAKER_02]: are calling the Thanos like, you know,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other name for it is the golden
ticket.
Fino.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they called it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The golden ticket.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've worked with it in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I have the seed stock that I used when
I worked with it and I'm going to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: get it back again and do some more work
with it so I can stabilize something I
[SPEAKER_02]: like and get it out to the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, cause I liked that one a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, just having mentioned
the Cindy 99 before being friends with
[SPEAKER_01]: Duke, um, that made me realize,
um, who's, who's a breeder you would like
[SPEAKER_01]: to do a collaboration with, um,
and do something with them as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: just, you know, buy a packet and go from
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have, I guess you'd call them
heroes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have so many heroes in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, there's a good handful or two
breeders out there that I would love to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, just it would, it would make my day,
you know, uh, I, but really, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, who are some of those
heroes, you know, feel free to list some
[SPEAKER_01]: off if you want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I didn't know how that worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know if I was allowed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's brothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Graham would be a cool one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there's, what is it called?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for a while I wanted to do something
with Moxie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not old, old heroes of mine or
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're not old like that,
but, uh, I had respect for what they were
[SPEAKER_02]: doing for some of their concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm always involved in the
concentrate field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I got a hold to some of their
concentrates and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had kind of had the thought like,
man, I'd like to work with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say for a lot of
people who don't know, um, there'd be some
[SPEAKER_01]: people who know that Moxies are a seed
seller and they do pretty good seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but they also primarily do,
um, a lot of concentrates over in the
[SPEAKER_01]: States from what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so I would really like to work
with them, uh, like old, old school,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, uh, some shanty baba action I would
like, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some of the, I don't want to
name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the larger companies that I'd like
to work with because it would probably
[SPEAKER_02]: never happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'd look dumb, but like it would
be work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be cool to work with rare
darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it seems like when I'm at the
cups, I'm always like near them at the
[SPEAKER_02]: booths and we never talk really or
anything, but, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of the, a lot of the
people here, it seems like they're real
[SPEAKER_02]: clicked up and, uh, it's hard to get into
the clicks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're not cool with certain crews
or something, they don't, you show you any
[SPEAKER_02]: attention and I don't go out there putting
myself out there to get any attention
[SPEAKER_02]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, it's kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't really talk to that many
breeders around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty, pretty, uh, I'm pretty much a
hermit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just stay, uh, to myself and breed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There I would be in heavy respect to work
with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'll just leave it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I could, my list would go on because
I love a lot of readers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, just in terms of that
clickiness, I mean, even from overseas,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can kind of observe that quite clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to a friend the other day
and he lives in LA and he said he couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: get a certain cut that, um, I can't
remember which one it was, but I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: it was, it would be pretty easy to get it
living in LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he echoed the same sentiments,
you know, like, Oh no, it's still very
[SPEAKER_01]: clicky as to, you know, who can get what
and who will help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was a bit sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, it is because I'm not that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I want to work with people that are
like-minded to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there's other companies out there that
have things that I would like to breed to
[SPEAKER_02]: that, uh, you know, I just don't because I
don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the, some of the companies are a
little too big and they've already got
[SPEAKER_02]: their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't need to bring any more
attention to them, you know, by something
[SPEAKER_02]: up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's one strain that, uh,
either you yourself or just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: society, the community in general has lost
that you really wish you had back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's an easy one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, good, good skunk is hard to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was like the original and now
it's lost like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems outrageous in my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not completely lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but, um, as far as the mainstream
goes, like you, you know, skunk's just not
[SPEAKER_02]: really that heard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it needs, it needs to be there more
hazes as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like hazes need to make a comeback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunks need to make a comeback.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so did you ever get a chance to grow
the roadkill skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, unfortunately, no, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, big dream of mine, but never happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always interested in asking people
about that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's got, you know, one of those
ones where everyone's interested in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's so little information about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's, there's a little old lady
that lives down the road from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I go, when I go for walks,
I see her sitting out on a porch every
[SPEAKER_02]: morning and, uh, she keeps, she keeps the
hope alive for me because she,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's got a pretty large greenhouse in her
backyard and it reeks of skunk and some
[SPEAKER_02]: high quality skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, it's still out there very slick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, she's a little, little old frail
gray haired lady and, uh, she's,
[SPEAKER_02]: she's keeping the skunk alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over there at least.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can walk a few blocks on the
right day and you'll see four or five
[SPEAKER_02]: people sitting outside in the front yard
token of bowl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, it's pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's not supposed to be that out in
the open, but it is, if you look,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you keep an eye out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you mentioned earlier, you were
going to pack up your packaging,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and have things like lab percentages
on them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This kind of brings me to two questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, how do you feel about lab
percentages?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, do you feel like a lot of
people I've spoken to said that the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry is very driven by
percentages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's easy for, you know,
them to be inflated just for purposes of
[SPEAKER_01]: wholesale and selling them whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, one, how do you feel
about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I feel like the industry concentrates
on it too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I can sit down with anyone that talks
about percentages and whip out something
[SPEAKER_02]: that tastes good, smells good,
smokes good, and makes them just as happy
[SPEAKER_02]: as any, uh, high twenties, you know,
that you can pull out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was going to say, when someone
says they've got some 30% weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I feel about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I said high twenties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paperwork and I would like to do research
afterwards to see what that laboratory,
[SPEAKER_02]: how their testing methods are and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess when we expect to see your
future packaging, we're not going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: mid thirties on it or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that, if I get tested at thirties,
I'm going to have to send some more in to
[SPEAKER_02]: get tested again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no, yeah, I don't, uh, I don't see
that happening on any buddies near future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the, you know, I w I'm going to
post realistic numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'm going to post an average number.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't post 23.87, you know, um,
on the packaging, but I'll post a,
[SPEAKER_02]: a realistic number.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do multiple and I'll probably
Instagram a picture, all the test sheets
[SPEAKER_02]: just, you know, for the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's unfortunately the industry is
concentrated on numbers, but so I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to give them those numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not going to strive to try to
shoot for only the highest of high
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'm going to be, uh, testing as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so, you know, that's, that's my
big, my big focus is flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the followup to that was, I don't know
if you've seen it, but there's a few
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders now who have kind of this
template for their new strains in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of really good info on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it gives like the number of
phenotypes, what you can maybe expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: From each phenotype as well as your
general flowering times and how much it
[SPEAKER_01]: will stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you ever consider giving information
like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would assume that based on the
work you do, you know, like growing out
[SPEAKER_01]: the strains to test it, you would have a
rough idea of say the number of phenotypes
[SPEAKER_01]: there are in each cross and what to expect
from each.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that that information is
overkill or you'd maybe be interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: including that in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think in the past, I think that was
overkill.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people just wanted quality seeds
and wanted to grow it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and they needed a rough number of when
they might need to harvest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, because in the past people did take a
lot of pride on, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: checking, uh, trichomes or trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, sorry, I'm itching a mosquito bite
from yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, anyways, uh, anyways, people used to
check the color of their trichomes and
[SPEAKER_02]: take a lot of pride in when they harvested
knowing that, you know, it was to the day
[SPEAKER_02]: when they wanted it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, nowadays people like to see a number
on the package and if it says nine weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've been checking it on their calendar
and they're going to harvest it at nine
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I think that the new information
for the new growers and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, cause there's so many that don't have
years of experience and stuff that are
[SPEAKER_02]: growing legally and illegally now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so they need a little bit of more
reference now, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I think in the future, you'll
probably see more of that from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe the dreaded topic for you,
um, not for some feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your, what's your thoughts and will
we ever see any from Johnston genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm sure you've got some killer
females that, you know, like people would
[SPEAKER_01]: say that if you put them, you made some S
ones, you know, that'd be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, there's, uh, yeah, there's
definitely been a lot of talk of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if you were to see a feminized
come from me, it probably wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_02]: coming directly from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would probably come from another
breeder that does feminize seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, that I would do a collaboration with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's not something that I do and I
like doing things I feel comfortable with
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, feminizing isn't something I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I, I used to say, you know,
it's polluting the genetics, genetic pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now I like, I understand that it has a
place in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, not everyone can, you know,
weed out the mills and not everyone has
[SPEAKER_02]: the skill and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people just want the reliability of
planting a seed and having bud to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I would be okay with doing a
collaboration breeder with someone that
[SPEAKER_02]: knew what they were doing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, and just like autos, like I might
work with a couple of auto companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's actually been in the discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I may do some work with a couple of
auto companies this year to do a Johnson's
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics co-lab, uh, on auto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not against it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not against it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, just from your experience,
do you know if those autos you were
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about doing, that's something
we've, we often hear spoken about as like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the, the European market is very
after autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find that there's much demand in
other parts or it really is just in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Europe's obviously the, the big bread
winner for the auto market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, um, you know, just in America,
uh, house size, yard size and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: is just on average, it's larger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so people have more space and feel
more comfortable with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: even just growing a, a shorter Indica or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that's that team's team tends to be
built, be the real winner around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in, in Europe, uh, I do see that
that's my biggest, uh, request area for
[SPEAKER_02]: autos and that, you know, you may see it
come from me as a, uh, collaboration
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding with another company here in the
next, in the next year or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned earlier that you are a big
fan of the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: About kind of this rise in, uh,
the former old traditions of people like
[SPEAKER_01]: Frenchy cannoli and just kind of this
artisan hash market.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about that and how it
compares to say our more modern
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrates, like, you know, your,
your rosin and your live resin and all
[SPEAKER_01]: these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I hope that we never lose the old
traditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's in fact something I'm going to be
working on personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I don't want to see the art of good
quality hash go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause there's going to always like the
new market is obviously about all these
[SPEAKER_02]: modern concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that'll just keep growing and there's
always going to be a ton of people wanting
[SPEAKER_02]: to work with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I think that if, you know,
enough people and the right people get
[SPEAKER_02]: into bringing more attention to what the
old school real high quality hash was,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, I think more people will catch onto it
again in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's definitely something I love to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at the end of the day, what would
be your favorite form of concentrate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, live resin hash dry sieve.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a real tough one because,
you know, real good quality live resin or
[SPEAKER_02]: distillate that's made now, uh,
some of that can just be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor and the high associated with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it sits right there with smoking
it and old, like, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a temple ball or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, they both are very high on
my, my skill of respect for the smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's hard to beat a good
distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, it's an amazing hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, for those that haven't hit it,
it takes place outrageous and it is very
[SPEAKER_02]: high potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sometimes over 95% in some
cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be high and that's other
people's numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not ever personally tested any form
of distillate, but just from seeing what
[SPEAKER_02]: other people say, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we were to take a look at your
garden right now, what type of lights do
[SPEAKER_01]: we have in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always interested to know,
have you made the conversion to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like you double ended bulbs,
you know, like the, the, I hate saying it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, you give eaters or,
you know, do you still more of an old
[SPEAKER_01]: school guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your HID lights or what type of
tech do you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, LEC, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light emitting ceramic or some people call
it like CMH, uh, ceramic metal halide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's even another acronym
out there for it, but, um, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: the 315 watt Phillips bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, soon, soon to probably be running
double bulb fixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, you know, you may or may not
have an answer to this, but have you heard
[SPEAKER_01]: anything at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe you whispers or rumors.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is the next step of
growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, have you heard of any maybe
major innovations that are maybe coming
[SPEAKER_01]: through the pipeline and we might see them
in the near future?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like maybe for example,
you know, a few years ago, someone would
[SPEAKER_01]: have said, Oh, you know, there's this new
lighting technology coming out soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: These double ended bulbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, I think that the things that are
going to blow up are things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: already out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that in the future,
the plasma market will get bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think that it will grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it kind of blew up for a second and
then it kind of went away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not that many people are running
plasma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but at led, I think is the big,
that's what a lot of companies are
[SPEAKER_02]: spending the money in to do the research
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and even companies that aren't making
grow lights right now, uh, that are doing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just led research, they're,
they're making some big steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I was working with a company for a
while and I may see in the future,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we were working on developing new
spectrums.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were asking me, you know,
kind of what, what I would like to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were working on stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, there's a lot of growth in
the led market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like more attention go into
the LEC market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see higher power LECs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there is a company out there that has
a 400 watt LEC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can find them on, on the internet,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but it's in that, that bulb is
actually made by GE.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, but it's a, it's also the
same technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see more into that technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people could be running thousand watt
LECs in a, in a small room or a tent or
[SPEAKER_02]: something, they would have amazing,
uh, spectrum and amazing light output.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, um, onto kind of a bit of a
more political based question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you think, um, was one or some of
the pitfalls of the American legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: model?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what would you have improved if you
could have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what about like their standing walls
that we have in, in office right now and
[SPEAKER_02]: what would I like to change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think they did very good for coming
up with a complete new law system or
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's just been, uh,
ignored.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there are some small loopholes that
need to be covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like there's a lot of growers here in,
in Colorado, they grow over what they
[SPEAKER_02]: need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, for their, they harvest and
they trim down and they weigh it and they
[SPEAKER_02]: say, Whoa, I have enough to last me for a
year and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and they don't need all that
product because they're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: growing again next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Colorado doesn't have a system in,
in order.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, for them to take in their,
uh, product to be tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once it's been tested, maybe go in for
approval to be sold back to a dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: so it can go back out to the, you know,
the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, little thing, little things like that
kind of need to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you saying that at the moment in
that situation, they would just be sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: on a surplus and not really have anything
to do with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: All they can do with is smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: The implication is it's kind of pushing
them maybe towards the black market of
[SPEAKER_01]: selling it under the table because they're
just sitting on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, kind of like they say idle hands,
you know, uh, when you have some just
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting there and you see it and in
temptations around, uh, there are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be, you know, percentages of people that
will, you know, take that route.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I, you know, I recommend everyone
here, at least in Colorado where
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's legal, you know, abide by the
laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gifted and we're, you know,
this, this luxury, uh, of having all this
[SPEAKER_02]: weight lifted off our shoulders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not hard here to abide by the
law.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the law is extremely, uh,
relaxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you could say there's people with
crazy plant count numbers that can grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, crazy numbers at home,
uh, which they shouldn't be, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you can have a doctor write you
up where you're allowed to buy a pound a
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you're allowed to, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, that's getting rare cause
they're cracking out on stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your average, you know, you,
when you sign up, I think you're allowed
[SPEAKER_02]: to buy two ounces any day, every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, you know, for a medical card,
uh, for recreational, uh, I think it's an
[SPEAKER_02]: ounce a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, you know, that's a pretty relaxed
law.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even if you are, a real heavy
partier, uh, smoking good Colorado buds,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard to smoke an ounce a day with
your friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it, but you can always go back
tomorrow and buy another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just getting to the last part of the
interview now, we're just going to do some
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of short lighthearted questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one I always love to ask everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can go back to one place,
you know, geographically at one point in
[SPEAKER_01]: time to get some land race seeds,
where would it be and why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it would have probably been a couple
thousand years ago, Asia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would have liked to add some of the
early, early stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that would, I'm still after some
actual true Asian land race seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, anybody out there that's listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I, I'm really after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would really like, if I could just
take even a time period of seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be, you know, a couple thousand
years ago, old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I've never thought of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be almost scary to think of what it
would be like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take something with a base foundation,
uh, you know, uh, genetic structure of old
[SPEAKER_02]: school back then and hybridize it with
something from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, you're going to work
it out in a different direction for the
[SPEAKER_01]: next thousand years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that would be interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: See a whole new evolution of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think is, uh, the worst
thing to happen to the cannabis scene in
[SPEAKER_01]: America?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, as far as politically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe even just in general,
you know, maybe, maybe, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people are more, more in it for the money
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that could be maybe one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's one of the things I
don't like seeing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it is going to be a big money
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but there's, everybody doesn't have to
be focused on that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the money will come,
uh, put in the work and do, do what's
[SPEAKER_02]: right for the seed, do what's right for
the plant and for the grower and for the
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else will come, you know,
uh, like the, the greed that's associated
[SPEAKER_02]: with it and, and the clickiness that we
talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that needs to go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not stuff that's associated with
people that smoke weed, that grow weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like new modern day weeds culture
and that thing that needs to go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what is, uh, the worst strain in
your opinion?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, worst is a funny word.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, the worst for me, like there's like
a strain or two out there that when people
[SPEAKER_02]: bring it around, I won't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to call that the worst,
uh, and it's only, it's funny for me
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's great white shark.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it gives me an absolute like panic
attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time I smoke it, I get the jitters
and I am so anxiety filled.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and everyone else around me is just
like, wow, this is great smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I pass on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I call it the worst because it just
hammers me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why there's something about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get high anxiety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not because it's bad at all,
but for me it's the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, conversely, what's, what's the
best or your favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, I have probably a top 10 of
strains, but that's a top three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that would probably be kosher kosher
Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Chocolo and wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I feel like I'm going in order now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to pick my number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I enjoy a good old school haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, they're getting pretty hard to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the old hazes, uh, that no one
cares to take the time to grow anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that would just in general,
that would be a top one also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your kind of growing tip for
everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's something where, you know,
like most of the time when people contact
[SPEAKER_01]: you and they've got a problem,
you know, it's this or just in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like what's something where
people normally are just maybe could
[SPEAKER_01]: improve in some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there'll be like a kind of a three
part answer to that, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one would be just really be in touch
with your plants, spend a lot of time with
[SPEAKER_02]: them, watch them, you know, watch them
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, especially if you're new at this,
that they should be your babies,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that you should probably
watching them like probably too often.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, when you start growing out,
you want to see, uh, every, every 10
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes you want to look at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, I would just say spend a lot of
time with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, number two, talk to other growers
nowadays with, with the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of information to be had,
uh, even without asking a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can type in something on Google or in
any kind of these platforms and your
[SPEAKER_02]: questions already been answered somewhere
along the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but there are people to talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like, that's the biggest thing
you could do to help yourself is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, go to other growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're having an issue, don't just
try to take it upon yourself and assume,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what you're going to do to fix
an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then like three, uh, you know,
bug mitigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want bugs of any kind,
but unless you use good bugs, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: a hundred bugs and you know, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so keep an eye out for bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have to use something to,
uh, control them, there are organic
[SPEAKER_02]: options out there that do a pretty good
job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So look into those like, cause you will be
smoking this product or eating or
[SPEAKER_02]: ingesting it in some fashion in the
future, I assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what is your random product
endorsement?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I would say like for an ingredient,
like a little tip, uh, look into like
[SPEAKER_02]: insect for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's, you know, uh, insect dung,
uh, I believe that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but it's look into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, it's got quite a few health
benefits to your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a natural thing that can help,
uh, the plant in multiple ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, if you look it up, uh,
insect brass F R A S S for those that
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it like something you mix into your
soil or like a top dressing thing or you
[SPEAKER_02]: can actually do both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yes, it's, it's something that you
would add into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that it gets it, it has,
uh, some kind of low numbers of nutrient,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, but it's stable and it, uh,
actually has, uh, I think they could call
[SPEAKER_02]: it chitin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's a chemical that's in there that
helps the plant in a couple of ways of
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like it's immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think helps with sugar polymers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, yeah, it's a, it's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be like a simple thing I'd
say to like look into for people,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, like a little, I guess, added up to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Emerald Cup this year is looking
like it's going to be a really cool event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is there any chance people will be
able to catch you there and have anything
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe for sale?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they will be able to catch me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't have anything for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I will probably be running around,
checking the place out, uh, in the crowd.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, a couple of times,
uh, throughout the event, you'll be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to probably catch me at, uh, Ed
Rosenthal's booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we'll be hanging out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so yeah, I'll definitely be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you actually with Ed
Rosenthal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's actually pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he contacted me here a while back,
um, asking if I wanted to come up,
[SPEAKER_02]: be in his, uh, upcoming book, which blew
my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he is definitely one of my heroes,
uh, for many, many, many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so when he contacted me, I was just
ecstatic and honored to be able to have
[SPEAKER_02]: that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did some work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he'll be featuring the Grandma Sugar
Cookies and the Granddaddy Platinum Pert
[SPEAKER_02]: Berry Cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he'll be showcasing both those
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And talking a little bit about us as a
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we, though originally there was
going to be, uh, one book and it was going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be the Greatest Hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe it was going to be called
the Greatest Hits and Rising Stars,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, edition of the Big Book of Buds
series.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, that book got too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he had, he added too much information,
too many pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it got split into two books.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so right now the Big Book of Buds
Greatest Hits is coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here shortly there will be another
book coming out and I'm not sure of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the title.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have an idea of the title,
but I can't release that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that will be coming out soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be in that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, um, that's some awesome news to
hear, especially, you know, on a personal
[SPEAKER_01]: note, it must be great to be getting some
recognition from someone, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you look up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It literally, there's not words that can
describe how I felt when, at that moment
[SPEAKER_02]: when he contacted me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then actually, uh, last year when I
was having a booth in the Michigan
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis Cup, uh, he popped by the booth
and I was sitting there, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: talking with customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were pretty busy and he walked up and I
looked up and I seen him and I,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never starstruck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've met multiple celebrities and hang
out, you know, they're just people just
[SPEAKER_02]: like you and me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but when I saw Ed, I was starstruck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I basically could just answer his
questions with short answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he asked us to get together for a
picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we took a picture with the group and,
uh, we talked a little bit and then he
[SPEAKER_02]: headed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after he left, I turned to the rest of
my crew and I said, God, guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just met Ed Rosenthal and I was almost
shaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you brought up a good point there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, your grandma's sugar cookies,
that's, um, a strain that looked like it
[SPEAKER_01]: was kind of in the run for like your kind
of your staple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's been worked a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been worked in a few different
directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it about the grandma's sugar
cookies that stood out to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's one of the few scenarios where
I was looking at the industry and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was trying to bring something of
mine to the table mixed with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: an obvious favorite, the cookies at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so I, you know, I was trying to
get something for my customer base that
[SPEAKER_02]: where they could have a cookie option for
me is really where that started from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I had no idea that it would turn out
to be like, like you said, it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is pretty much my staple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which is, you know, cool for me
because, uh, that's actually reminiscent
[SPEAKER_02]: of, uh, my actual grandmother and her,
her actual sugar cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that was the, that was the whole
naming behind that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's long since passed, uh,
which, so it's nice to see that strain get
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit of attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it's a kind of a nod to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that you then decided to work
it out, you know, we've then got the
[SPEAKER_01]: double stuffed cookies and the all star
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that kind of just a testament to how,
how like solid of a base that strain was
[SPEAKER_01]: on its own?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was through multitude of feedback that
I got from people.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were coming to me saying they,
they liked it better than the original
[SPEAKER_02]: cookie and then it produced more and
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you know, I did, I won't be the
one to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that gave me enough of an,
uh, you know, enough of what I needed to
[SPEAKER_02]: know to keep working with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that brings us basically to the
end of the interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there any general comments or shout
outs you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I'd like to give a shout out
mainly number one to my fiance,
[SPEAKER_02]: Kristen, uh, without her, none of this
would be possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, she puts up with a lot of a lot for me
and lets me do basically whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I definitely give a shout out to
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I want to give a shout out to Adam,
uh, my lead grower, uh, without him,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of this also wouldn't be possible
cause he handles a lot of stuff when I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not able to, um, and then to my mom and
pops, uh, without them, I wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, uh, it sounds like there's
always a, um, a strong woman behind every
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're, they're always buy in one
form or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always, I was a great honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone should keep an eye out for
some Johnston genetics and, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: there'll be some new releases in the
coming year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There would probably be two drops,
uh, one here in a couple months and then
[SPEAKER_02]: one towards, uh, after the first of the
year for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then yeah, we'll have some new
t-shirt designs out some happy ends and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're working on more gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we've got a lot of requests for gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I was actually going to say,
can I get a shirt?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we'll talk in a minute, in a minute
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I was going to say, and for anyone
else, uh, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not stingy with the shirts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, thanks so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to Johnny from Johnston genetics
again
[SPEAKER_01]: and 420 Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure to grab some Johnson genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.
[SPEAKER_02]: La la la la la.
Yeah.
