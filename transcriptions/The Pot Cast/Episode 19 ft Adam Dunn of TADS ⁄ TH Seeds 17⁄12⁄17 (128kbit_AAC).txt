[SPEAKER_01]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big thank you and welcome to a man
who needs a little introduction from this
[SPEAKER_01]: scene, the pod father himself,
Adam Dunn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first question we start everyone off
with is what was your first experience
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's a good one, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to try to piece together the actual
years I was in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in fourth grade in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to go to a school called Wonderland
Elementary, like famous Wonderland murders
[SPEAKER_03]: all happen around there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very rich area.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom was going out with Robert Downey
Senior actually at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So his sister and Robert Downey Junior's
sister is named Alison and she was like
[SPEAKER_03]: basically my babysitter at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was a terrible babysitter.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had no no feel for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And her thing was to just she thought it'd
be fun to get me really blazed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I kind of I grew up around
weed a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wasn't like unfamiliar.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I kind of never
ventured into that world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so she basically was smoking a joint
and kind of like passing it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember not thinking anything
happened at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was just like, yeah, nothing
happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but then like about three or four days
later, when we were talking about it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was told her I said, yeah, I didn't feel
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was she's like, what did you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, no, I didn't really feel
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was like, you didn't if you saw
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember her telling me like how high I
was, you know, because I was like super
[SPEAKER_03]: hyperactive and running around crazy on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But not crazy, crazy, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like so it is kind of interesting
because now as an adult, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people get really like mellowed
out when they smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've always had that thing where I
kind of got more hyped up from it in a
[SPEAKER_03]: sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of felt like it was in my
chemistry or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so it was so it was basically
Robert Downey Jr. sister, which makes it
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of ironic these days because,
you know, if you want to go on sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: drug royalty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: What an epic story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it was so it was kind of a wacky
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, later on, like when I
was about 13, I really it was funny
[SPEAKER_03]: between when I was 13, I quit smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I quit smoking weed for about two years
because I was totally into the military.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I was going to go into like I
was in Civil Air Patrol and I was planning
[SPEAKER_03]: on going into the military.
[SPEAKER_03]: So between 11 and 13, I kind of like had a
little like a sesh there basically for a
[SPEAKER_03]: few years because then after I smoked with
her, I kind of would smoke every,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, she'd give me hits here and
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I started to kind of get get into
it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I kind of had a twist at around
13.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, nope, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm quitting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I went through a quitting period.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time I was 13, I was already
quitting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I started up again when I was
about 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was like a two year, two year
period there where I didn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a few questions that I'd love
to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the first one, you kind of touched
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there is any truth behind
that whole idea of like people not getting
[SPEAKER_01]: high on their first time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you think it's just a case of not
knowing how to inhale properly or?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think it's just not recognizing is
the key.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that's the, you know,
because what I always tell people is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, when they like, especially
people who have never smoked weed before
[SPEAKER_03]: and they have this sort of predisposition
to it, like they're like a preconception
[SPEAKER_03]: where they're like, oh, it's, you know,
it's going to make you lazy or it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to make you hungry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to make you this that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you don't know what to expect,
actually, cannabis is very mild as we
[SPEAKER_03]: know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mild and yet intense and powerful in
its own way, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the first couple of times you do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's you're expecting fireworks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not like an acid strip or
something like that where, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, if you don't, you know, somebody who
takes acid and they say, I didn't feel
[SPEAKER_03]: anything, then they have a completely
different chemistry, let's say,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But with weed, because it's such a subtle
thing, you're kind of like, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, maybe you just didn't notice it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the second or third time you do
it, you really tune in on it, it seems
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then a lot of times I think it's your
what people see in you and what you like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, how it is when you think no one
knows you're high kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the minute somebody sees your
eyes are really red, what are you high?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that kind of like triggers it
where now you feel high because someone
[SPEAKER_03]: noticed that your eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's probably the reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think there could be some good
truth in that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we just fast forward a moment to when
you first started growing, what was the
[SPEAKER_01]: situation like there?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, well, basically, when I lived in Rhode
Island when I was about 16, I had I bought
[SPEAKER_03]: a photo tron, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm one of those guys and I bought two
photo trons out of high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was living with my mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was living with my mom at the time and
single mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a house in Jamestown, Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I basically built a little room in my
basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember, like, kind of like I built
this room in the corner and I had zero
[SPEAKER_03]: carpentry skills at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of just slapped up some really
makeshift little thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I put these two photo trons in
there and followed the instructions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And realized that it was way too small for
what I was trying to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I put six plants in that tiny little
thing and then cut them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember I had some Hawaiian seeds
at my mom from some weed that my mom's and
[SPEAKER_03]: her friends were smoking at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had some like Thai seeds and I had some
some other random Mexican or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just like so there's some of
them are just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grew so fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember they were if you're not
familiar with the phototron that the
[SPEAKER_03]: medium that they use is sphagnum moss.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very wet and there's no drainage
at the bottom of those units.
[SPEAKER_03]: So literally when you turn on like six
fluorescent lights in a little tiny box
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you put a bunch of water at the
bottom, it ends up turning into like a
[SPEAKER_03]: vapor trap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the whole thing was just dripping
down the sides.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I remember this is kind of funny,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I woke up in the morning with my mom
waking me up and she's like, Adam,
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam, your plants are on fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like half asleep and I was like,
huh, like just like what plants on fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was like it hit me like,
oh, my God, my plants are on fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I ran out of the house and ran
downstairs and they were just like a
[SPEAKER_03]: melted blob of plastic because the
dripping of the water going down the sides
[SPEAKER_03]: and ended up into the bottom of the where
the sockets basically were and shorted
[SPEAKER_03]: them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ended up like literally almost
burning, you know, could have burned my
[SPEAKER_03]: whole place down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like my first attempt at growing
was a complete and utter failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the phototron still to this day,
I mean, they've sold so many of those
[SPEAKER_03]: units.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like I was probably one of their
first victims.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was like I was that that that kid
who ordered this thing online or not even
[SPEAKER_03]: online ordered it in the magazine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, when I got the box,
I was like, can't be the unit is this box
[SPEAKER_03]: is too small.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was like, I guess,
I guess it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I put it all together and it was
smaller than I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was less robust than I thought,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the end, it did get my fever sort
of going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cool part was I put that little I
put that little room together and then I
[SPEAKER_03]: realized that that was the way to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put a light in the room and actually
grow in the whole room, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was kind of like the the
beginning of the fever for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in 1980.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was in 1985.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of interesting, the whole
phototron thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like people look back on it
with almost like this positive reminiscent
[SPEAKER_01]: view where they kind of like, oh,
yeah, the phototron.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got done by that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that guy, Julian D.
[SPEAKER_03]: DiMarco, the guy who owned that company,
he I talked to him many times because when
[SPEAKER_03]: I first ordered that phototron,
I think I was probably waived maybe two or
[SPEAKER_03]: three because I mean, I'm sure it's been a
few years out, but it hadn't it was still
[SPEAKER_03]: the original hand drawing of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like there was no photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like the way that the photo of
it looked, it looked like like so much
[SPEAKER_03]: more action was going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you actually got it and you
turned it on, you're like, wait a minute,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no air moving through this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was so many things that needed
to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end, it the one thing I can say
is that it did at least get me excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the only thing he taught me was
probably internodes because that was his
[SPEAKER_03]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: His whole thing was about internodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like literally he was focused so much on
that, like internodal length and then how
[SPEAKER_03]: many internodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, OK, but there's more to a
plant than internodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it was a it was an interesting
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the two phototrons that I had,
one was mine, one was my friend's.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think I'm not sure which one
actually melted, but basically they melted
[SPEAKER_03]: together into a big blob.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we ended up getting two more
replacements and we didn't want them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told him I just want my money back.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he ended up sending me two
replacements, which I ended up trading for
[SPEAKER_03]: a snowboard at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like one of those like,
you know, those classic moments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what ever happened to those
other units.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the most asked questions I've
received to, you know, shoot your way is
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially what's the backstory on the
bubblegum?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in this context, how do we go
from that first grow to you having the
[SPEAKER_01]: bubblegum?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so when I lived in Amsterdam in 8990,
I had a friend who came through and
[SPEAKER_03]: basically I was working at the Hash Museum
at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just started working at the Hash Museum
in 1990, I guess it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm standing there one day and this
guy walks in and I grew up a little bit in
[SPEAKER_03]: Rhode Island when I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the phototron thing went down
when my grandmother was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of where my grandmother's from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm from New York originally,
but then later on when I was living with
[SPEAKER_03]: my grandmother, I kind of got a lot of
friends around there and I kind of forced
[SPEAKER_03]: my mom to to move there at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was very familiar with that Rhode
Island accent and that Rhode Island sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of mentality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this guy walks in and he's like,
I'm like, where are you from?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, oh, from Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I'm like, oh, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from Rhode Island, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And something about Rhode Island,
which is like it was it was like a.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always think of it as a place to get in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's just because I grew up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like it was always like that was
the worst place to for weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it always had this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was like, oh, you're from Rhode
Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of just I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I felt like I had to protect him from
getting in trouble or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, what are you doing here?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, yeah, he came here to learn how
to grow weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, oh, wow, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got I'm just trying to put together a
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was a contractor from Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's really good with building.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we basically took this apartment.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came over to my apartment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I let him stay there with me and we built
this grow room together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just designed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically all I had to do is make
coffee and he would build it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I literally he would.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was one of those guys who was kind of
like difficult to work with because he
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't let you do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like he'd be like, all right,
give me that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Except for like maybe hand me a tool or do
this or do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the most part, it was like I
remember I would leave.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like leaving with a bunch of
materials in the room and I would go and
[SPEAKER_03]: make coffees and come back and he'd be
like lifting up a thing by by himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just kind of one of those
dudes all around kind of construction kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he didn't really know much about
growing weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he brought seeds from Rhode Island with
him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was actually called chewing gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't called bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called chewing gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was because so he was getting the
seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He basically he was getting weed off of a
guy who was from Illinois and a guy in the
[SPEAKER_03]: the funny part about that whole story was
over the years, like I had always thought
[SPEAKER_03]: he said Indiana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was so I put the word out like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got these from Indiana from a guy from
Indiana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later when this whole Indiana
bubble gum thing came out, it's a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of a.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, it's a little bit of a mystery
because I know I met guys from Indiana who
[SPEAKER_03]: had a variety called bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I called it bubble gum, it was only
we changed the name from chewing gum to
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble gum because we didn't think like it
just didn't have a good sound to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like chewing gum is something that
ends up on the bottom of your shoe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bubble gum is this is what you put in your
mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like chewing gum is just kind of
because the reason he called it chewing
[SPEAKER_03]: gum was the fact that he would he had a
bar called the Church House in Providence
[SPEAKER_03]: and he would stick a bud underneath the
bar and literally just see what people's
[SPEAKER_03]: reactions would be because he'd be
standing there and then people come in and
[SPEAKER_03]: go, oh, what's up, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: You smell that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he'd be like, no, I don't know what
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he'd kind of feel them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if he thought they were cool,
he would hook them up and it was just
[SPEAKER_03]: literally like his little trick that he
played.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I so he had one hundred and
thirty five seeds that he had collected
[SPEAKER_03]: over a couple of year period.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically this guy that was selling
him the weed, occasionally he would have
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you either got to think it's either a
hermy or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically the guy was also super like
protective of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you got one, he'd give you ten
bucks back on the next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you brought him like five seeds
from your bud, he'd give you 50 bucks off
[SPEAKER_03]: your next ounce.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was that protective.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, just bring them back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my friend was like, no,
Victor was like, no, I never gave him
[SPEAKER_03]: anything back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always kept him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he came over, brought those seeds and
him and I basically we didn't grow those
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds for a good year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we we were growing everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I worked for Sensei at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was bringing home seeds from Sensei
and I was trying clones and I figured I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the land of plenty.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I what could you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't bring sand to the beach,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So so then I after a year when like at one
point Victor was working on another room
[SPEAKER_03]: and he was for somebody else and he was
biting down on a PVC on like a irrigation
[SPEAKER_03]: line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he's trying to pull one out with his
teeth basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he broke a tooth and he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no insurance because we're
Americans living in Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's Victor's about 10 years older
than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess at the time he was probably
about 40 and or maybe a little younger
[SPEAKER_03]: 30s, late 30s or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he basically had no health
insurance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but he was like but he did back home.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he flew back home to take care of his
teeth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while he was gone, I'd sprouted a
bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I sprouted most of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in the beginning we had 135 seeds
and I selected out of about I think around
[SPEAKER_03]: 60, 65 in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went through and I had narrowed those 65
down to seven and the seven were
[SPEAKER_03]: classified by size.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically A being the smallest and so
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, up to G let's say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I also had a male selected at the time
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And only on my second rounds I took that.
I did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I crossed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did some inbreeding on that first
generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I made some seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately then my room got broken
into.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my mother plants got killed and my
clones got stolen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my clones got stolen.
[SPEAKER_03]: My plant, my mother plants got killed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they literally took the door and
pulled it right off the hinges.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they lifted the door off the hinges.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just so my door was just standing
there next to my place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing in my house was gone or like
taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just literally like they went in,
went straight to my room.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took my light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Took my light bulbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And took my fucking pH meter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like my pH meter, my light
bulbs, my clones, and my mother plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my mother plants were cut and the
clones were gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mother plants were cut and taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they put them in a bag and took them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So crazy part was at the end of all of
that I went through everything and I
[SPEAKER_03]: found, so the C, so the middle,
right in the middle of the number three or
[SPEAKER_03]: C depending on how you remember I
classified them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the middle, so it was like not the
smallest plant, not the biggest plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: somewhere in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a way they kind of like,
at least out of all the things they did,
[SPEAKER_03]: because actually the biggest plant wasn't
as potent as the smallest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it literally was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the smaller ones seemed to be more
potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I narrowed it down to just that one
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got really paranoid as you
would be if somebody just stole all your
[SPEAKER_03]: shit and all your work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then I took that bubblegum and I
gave a clone of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically I revedged the plant because
it was like the lowest branch was not cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was cut but it was just like there was
still a little nub left.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I revedged that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gave a cut to Tony from Saga Mother Seeds
and I gave a cut to Simon from Serious
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeds because we all worked together at
the time at Sensei.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you look at the, so if you look
back in the kind of history of all these
[SPEAKER_03]: people, the bubbleberry from Tony was the
direct first round from when I gave him
[SPEAKER_03]: that bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you look at Simon from Serious
Seeds, he has, which kind of like to me
[SPEAKER_03]: was a little bit of a, this was a little
bit of a confusion for everybody was that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Simon continued selling bubblegum
seeds but his were sativa dominant and
[SPEAKER_03]: mine were more indica dominant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been a few like back-to-back
grows that people have done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a German magazine I think
that did one one time and you can really
[SPEAKER_03]: see pretty obviously that where we have
some shared genetics in there but
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely different directions,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like one goes in one direction,
one goes in the other direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that whole thing was like a complete
kind of, it was like the introduction to
[SPEAKER_03]: me to the whole industry and it really
showed me like how when you have
[SPEAKER_03]: something, because I basically,
the problem I had was I wasn't sharing it
[SPEAKER_03]: with anybody because I was a little bit
nervous about that in the very beginning
[SPEAKER_03]: because I worked for Sensi and I saw how
things can go wrong, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I figured out I had something
that was special because everybody was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, ooh, this bubblegum, man,
this is different, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really to me it wasn't that different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually like real good American
weed because it had that real thick,
[SPEAKER_03]: deep kind of deep lingering Afghan kind of
quality compared to a lot of the fruity
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that they had in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to me it was just like,
yeah, this just smells like America,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just smelling good old American weed,
strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, but it was so unique to the
Dutch market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's kind of obviously where,
you know, it turned people against me in
[SPEAKER_03]: the sense of breaking into my place and
really showed me like the lengths that
[SPEAKER_03]: people will go through if they can't have
it, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of what a lot of the
genetics are nowadays is if people can't
[SPEAKER_03]: have it, they'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll figure out a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you kind of alluded to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that that whole break in was
more of like a very specifically targeted
[SPEAKER_01]: thing as opposed to like a general break
in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, you know, and that's the
thing is like I was one of the things I've
[SPEAKER_03]: probably over the years because out of all
the breeders, I think I'm one of the more
[SPEAKER_03]: open books because I've always had a shop,
you know, at a retail store.
[SPEAKER_03]: At that time I didn't have one,
but I was working at a retail store.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here I am working at Sancy seeds,
you know, everybody knows kind of who I
[SPEAKER_03]: am.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point in time, you know,
the thing is that Amsterdam has a real
[SPEAKER_03]: underbelly to it, which you don't realize
when you first get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times people get there and
they're like, wow, this place is beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: and so quaint and nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, yeah, it's also run by,
you know, gangsters and people who really
[SPEAKER_03]: are pretty deep in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, when, when there's a huge
market of illegal drugs being sold,
[SPEAKER_03]: then there's always going to be that side
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's so, and cannabis,
whether, you know, people think it's legal
[SPEAKER_03]: or not, it's not when you're talking about
wholesale and when you're talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: how, you know, people view it when it
comes to like importing large amounts of
[SPEAKER_03]: hash or weed or any of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're definitely dealing with some
unsavory characters at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm a hundred percent sure it was based
on the fact that I didn't allow the cuts
[SPEAKER_03]: to go out because people were,
people were asking me, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was like, I'll give you 5,000 for a
cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once people offered me that much
money, I knew there was a reason,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, no, I don't think I want to
give this out, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it didn't, didn't, like I said,
it didn't take long.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it took maybe six months before
that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what happened for me,
which is a bit of a problem is I thought I
[SPEAKER_03]: was going to be smart and not sell seeds
and or give out cuts, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that was the way I was going to
figure out who stole my stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the meantime, Simon sold seeds and
Tony sold bubble berry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, people started to put on
almost any menu you went into in
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam, somebody would have bubble gum
on the menu and I'd go and check it out
[SPEAKER_03]: and be like, that is not, that's not it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was one of those first indicators of
how the name game gets flipped.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you got something that's popular,
it's going to get either stolen and or
[SPEAKER_03]: just renamed to your, you know,
the work that you've done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I also find it ironic that the
whole Indiana bubble gum thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: because what was funny was over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the beginning, for over 20 years,
I basically said that I came from Indiana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then only like five years ago,
my friend who actually gave me those seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: told me he's like, no, it wasn't Indiana.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, Illinois.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if by me putting out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then when I put out the.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now it's funny is that people will kind
of always want to work around you,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when people talk to me about bubble
gum, they go, oh no, no, no, I got the
[SPEAKER_03]: original.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the Indiana bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, okay, well that's got
nothing to do with mine actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause when I, I've grown the Indiana
bubble gum and it's very, it's a good
[SPEAKER_03]: yielder and everything, but it's
definitely a completely different animal,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a broad characterization we've
heard recently in my opinion is that the
[SPEAKER_01]: same kind of started in America in the
earliest days moved to Amsterdam during
[SPEAKER_01]: the period in which we're kind of
discussing and then shifted back to
[SPEAKER_01]: America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you broadly agree with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, if so, you kind of appear to
have followed the trend as it moved,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, was that something you
intentionally did?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's been, I mean,
yeah, this last time, yes, but not the,
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously I had nothing, I had nothing to
do with the first wave, but definitely,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I can't say I had anything to do with
the second wave, but I saw the second wave
[SPEAKER_03]: coming and I basically timed it this one
perfect and I felt like for the first time
[SPEAKER_03]: in my life, I'm actually ahead of the
game.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, when I, I a hundred percent
agree with that idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is that it wasn't,
it wasn't, there was no real scene to
[SPEAKER_03]: speak of except for the underground scene
and, you know, like people on tour with
[SPEAKER_03]: the dead or whatever there there in Cali,
there was a scene cause there was,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, harvest parties and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first, the cannabis cup was
inspired by the harvest parties in
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so yes, in that sense, the,
when you think of the industry and when
[SPEAKER_03]: you think of the, the cannabis scene,
I always, I always compare it to even
[SPEAKER_03]: though I'm hardly a surfer, but I'm like,
I always say like, I'm, I'm literally like
[SPEAKER_03]: how a surfer is so dedicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll fly all around the world just to
catch waves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of in the same way on a cannabis
wave on a long-term sort of sash.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my idea was like Amsterdam was the
big waves of the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's like a puddle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Compared to America, you know,
America's got literally gargantuan waves
[SPEAKER_03]: now, you know, because in the beginning,
like when I first moved to Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the thing about theirs is a lot
of small gardens, maybe 10 lighters,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, are your, are your considered
decent sized gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are 10, 600 watt lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people are like four to six lights
and little tiny apartments with very low
[SPEAKER_03]: amperage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you, but there was big gardens
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That never very hard to do in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's completely reversed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, like in Holland,
you won't find any greenhouses anymore,
[SPEAKER_03]: hardly because most of those are all
being, you know, checked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of like now how we were in a
totally different world to where you can
[SPEAKER_03]: Google earth anything and count the plants
and people's backyards.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the idea of growing gorilla growing
is pretty, pretty, pretty lost to this
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think this is the last year
California is going to be able to get away
[SPEAKER_03]: with what they've been doing for the last
50 years, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like by that, you mean having,
you know, a few extra numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, what they're doing now is
they're like yesterday on the show,
[SPEAKER_03]: I had Kevin Jodry from Wonderland nursery,
and he was explaining to me how they
[SPEAKER_03]: basically have been using, you know,
like real time Google earth, which is what
[SPEAKER_03]: the police have compared to what we have,
which is last year's Google earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they basically have been doing two
week intervals checks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they look at a place, they take a photo
of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They basically scan everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they scan all the, all the farms,
and then they look at a two week interval
[SPEAKER_03]: and they can see how much biomass is
basically being grown on each place.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they can sit there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can set the, the photos to like look
just at the foliage that's there and they
[SPEAKER_03]: can basically see like sit there and they
can count numbers and they can also just,
[SPEAKER_03]: cause they know that there's almost 9,000
farms illegal, like illegal farms in Cal,
[SPEAKER_03]: in NorCal that are registered with their
address, you know, because at a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: moment in time, everybody goes under the
radar, you know, and they, they don't bust
[SPEAKER_03]: you right out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wait until it's the perfect
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this whole year, what they did now
is they just sent out letters.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he said 10 days ago, they
basically were like cease and desist
[SPEAKER_03]: letters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody's getting these letters and
have to make major decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's going to be a lot of farms shut
down this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people are going to realize
that can no longer do the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: 2000 pounds in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so yeah, it's going to be a big
shakeup in the cannabis world just because
[SPEAKER_03]: of mostly because of legalization,
you know, the way it is.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we just jump back to the Dutch
scene for a moment quickly, a sentiment
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a fair bit is that even beyond
say some of the legal changes,
[SPEAKER_01]: which may have, you know, been a bit of a
catalyst for you to leave, some people
[SPEAKER_01]: express the idea that there's almost a bit
of a need for a change in the community,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I've heard a lot of people express
that it's a bit stagnant over there
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the flip side of that idea is
that that's not the case in the USA.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the, well, the thing is that when I,
when I lived in Holland, what I realized
[SPEAKER_03]: was, you know, our customer base was
Americans coming to Holland to experience
[SPEAKER_03]: freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that was our, that was our
literal customer base.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not sell seeds to Dutch people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not, I sold a few seeds to English,
a few seeds to French, a few seeds to
[SPEAKER_03]: Italians, but no Dutch, no hard,
like zero packs to Dutch people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so the scene there was always
foreigners who were coming over here,
[SPEAKER_03]: who coming over to there just to
experience freedom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now America's in that, in that zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is it's going state by
state.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's happening here is like already
states like Colorado that have been doing
[SPEAKER_03]: this, you know, started in 2009,
legalized in 2012, have now got all that
[SPEAKER_03]: under their belt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gotten to the point where now people
here have the same exact sentiment as they
[SPEAKER_03]: do with what you're saying about in
Holland, where everyone's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, it's kind of dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the scene, it's still here.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still, and everything has improved
as far as like the shops that were just a
[SPEAKER_03]: little hole in the wall have now upgraded.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same thing happened in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you go there now, the shops are
nicer than they've ever been, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's been always a big complaint
about Holland is like, you get there and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're like, oh man, this place is so
small and inconvenient and there's no air
[SPEAKER_03]: conditioning in the summer and it's cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, there's like, there's all
those little things and everybody's so
[SPEAKER_03]: like back in America, we would have this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they have a chance to do all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not even, they're a lot of
times dropping the ball even on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the biggest problem with Colorado is
they don't have a social scene,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, figured out properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you look at other places that
haven't got the rules yet, they have a
[SPEAKER_03]: better social scene because there's no
rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really like legalization kind of
destroys that sort of exciting side,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what happened in Holland
earlier because Holland's never been
[SPEAKER_03]: legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always been tolerated, but only the
only people that were really interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: it was the foreigners.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like the Dutch are not involved in
their own scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like that's the reason why it's so dead
over there is that they're not really into
[SPEAKER_03]: it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really weird, like as far as they've
had this golden goose in their hand the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole time and then they just kind of
forgot about it and didn't act on it
[SPEAKER_03]: properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now here is kind of similar,
but it's more of a legal framework where
[SPEAKER_03]: the more legal it gets and the more stiff
and difficult, you know, the problem with
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado is we're not allowed to have any
kind of activities that are cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: related.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can't have an event and say,
come to this cannabis event because the
[SPEAKER_03]: minute you do that, you're under the
scrutiny of the man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the problem is you can't get any
sponsors that have any legal things going
[SPEAKER_03]: on because they'll lose out because
they'll say, they'll come to them and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, you can't sponsor this event.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a registered dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's like, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: So dispensary can't like sponsor a
cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes no sense, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of a bit, I think that's a
bit of the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just kind of, we're coming out of the
underground market where, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the first time you go to a party and it's
all cool and relaxed, it's cause there's
[SPEAKER_03]: no rules probably, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that's the thing that kind of
kills it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like with all that being said,
was that part of the motivation for you to
[SPEAKER_01]: start the ADI?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, the whole idea of doing my
own event like that was based on the the
[SPEAKER_03]: type of listeners that we had on the show
and the sort of the core people that were
[SPEAKER_03]: involved were a lot of breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I kind of, what I wanted to do was
not create another event that was based on
[SPEAKER_03]: a million categories and trying to make it
so that we're, you know, everybody wins.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like more like, nah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of going back to that old mentality
of how you go, you know, say you go to a
[SPEAKER_03]: party and you've got good weed in your
pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to, you're going to show it
to anybody and everybody and smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody out just to prove that you've
got the best weed, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of like stoner 101,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the first thing you learned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, okay, I'm going to be the guy who
has the best weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the minute someone else has better
weed than you, you sort of slip that weed
[SPEAKER_03]: back in your pocket quietly and usually
skulk away, skulk away and go home.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like literally I've got situations where I
didn't have good weed on me and I didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: even want to go to a party.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't, it can't be me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't go, Hey, we got this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a way like stoners, and I always
tell it, it's like, if you want to know
[SPEAKER_03]: who the big stoner in a group is going to
be, it's going to be the kid who loved
[SPEAKER_03]: show and tell, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when he went to school, Oh,
it's show and tell day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to bring that metal from my dad,
from the war and tell the whole story or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that kid because he always wants to
have the cool thing and be the more,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the, the coolest thing in the
room or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's kind of where the most
simple way of putting it, but I think
[SPEAKER_03]: that's kind of like a, a classic stoner
the way you figure out who they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, if we just take a bit of a
step back from the ADI, what initially
[SPEAKER_01]: inspired you to start the Adam Dunn show?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually that came out of,
when I first came to Colorado to 2009,
[SPEAKER_03]: 2010 John Doe radio, who's Tim Martin,
he was, he'd been doing the show for a few
[SPEAKER_03]: years and he basically, I didn't,
you know, I was never much of a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even understand what podcasts
were back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of like, well, podcast,
like whatever people listen to those,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it wasn't never, it wasn't even
focusing on it, but he invited me on a
[SPEAKER_03]: show and I came on the show and it was
like, you know, one of his best shows as
[SPEAKER_03]: far as here I was just talking away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I didn't realize that
people forgot that people might be
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in that, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I ended up going back on his show
three, four, five times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was a moment when his show kind
of peeked out because he had his own
[SPEAKER_03]: little issues going on, mostly with
alcohol and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like getting drunk on the show
and getting all pissy with his people and
[SPEAKER_03]: like complaining about his sponsors on his
own show.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was like, ah, you can't do
that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically I was realizing that he,
like he actually got taken off the air,
[SPEAKER_03]: on the air, like alive on the air,
getting taken out by the police because he
[SPEAKER_03]: had broken into the studio and got all
drunk and locked himself in there,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was one of those crazy stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically I saw this like, like,
and I, and I was kind of bummed because
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd liked going on his show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I told them like, Hey,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do a Wednesday show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that was his slot was a Wednesday
slot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I'll, I'll take over your
Wednesday slot and just do something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did a show called seedy Wednesdays
and I figured my original concept was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, well, you know, I could just pull
out my phone and just call my random
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder friends and we can just wrap,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause then it's like, it's, you know,
straight to the source was the idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I did a few of those shows and with
zero format and just kind of was winging
[SPEAKER_03]: it, had had some people listening to it
and kind of realized that it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, for me, I always had a store and
I was always talking to people and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: always educating and trying to like help
people out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I kind of feel like this is an
extension of that in a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it felt real comfortable and really
felt really easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one of those things where I just
kind of stuck with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then at a certain point I realized
that I may want to just throw my name onto
[SPEAKER_03]: it to help kind of people know what the
show is about because it keeps it really
[SPEAKER_03]: open.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because one of the things, like when I
meet somebody, they're always like,
[SPEAKER_03]: so what do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I'm, it's a hard answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a hard thing to answer because yes,
I breed and I make seeds, but I also have
[SPEAKER_03]: a clothing company and I also have always
had, usually have a glass gallery and I
[SPEAKER_03]: have, you know, they have a lot,
a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really hard to pinpoint it to one
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where the, the concept of just
calling it the Adam Dunn show came in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I was like, you know what,
this could go into any direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's, let's just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's been, it's been really
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been one of those things where it's,
it's good to have an outlet, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's also good to, to, uh,
stay sort of relevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the things I realized in
this industry, it's quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can quickly become irrelevant if you
have no, if you're not really putting the
[SPEAKER_03]: energy into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always think you gotta, you know,
especially in a group situation,
[SPEAKER_03]: someone's gotta take the initiative.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, I feel like this is just another
step.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's funny is I'm sure you've
noticed it too, where it's like being a DJ
[SPEAKER_03]: a few years ago, maybe 10 years ago,
if you were a DJ, it's sort of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, you know, now everybody's a DJ or
so-called DJ, but, but like same thing
[SPEAKER_03]: with podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like right now I feel good that I
actually did it when I did it because now
[SPEAKER_03]: it feels like everybody wants to do a
podcast and you know, I definitely,
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody should try, but it is kind of
hard to, to, uh, keep it rolling.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you try to stick to only one subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can definitely agree on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I also get asked a lot is
people will message me and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I want to start a podcast,
but they won't know what it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be like, what should it be about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I don't know, man,
it's got to be organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got to do it about something that
you're passionate about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't tell someone to do a podcast
about because then otherwise you would
[SPEAKER_03]: have already done it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have the, if you have the greatest
idea for a podcast, but it's not what your
[SPEAKER_03]: subject that you're involved in,
it's going to be pretty hard to even
[SPEAKER_03]: manifest that one, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, you kind of touched on it,
but do you, did you ever envision the Adam
[SPEAKER_01]: Dunn show to be like of a specific format
or did you really honestly just think,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want it to be free flowing,
whatever comes from it comes through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you can actually, if you follow the
guy, if you follow it and you see like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, one of the things that,
that made the show sort of more popular
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and it's a shame that it's not still
rolling was that I had Mitch, had Mitch
[SPEAKER_03]: Janassa on board for a good year or so and
a year plus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he really helped me format it a little
better in the sense of he brought a little
[SPEAKER_03]: more structure to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the things that I've noticed
is that like, for instance, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: we all listen, now I listen to,
you know, not a lot of podcasts,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I listen to a few, like everybody I
listen to Joe Rogan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he's, it's funny because I
watched it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the beginning, I could tell that he was
very similar to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're kind of like a lot of, he likes a
lot of subjects.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a little all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: He also, you know, he has this guy that
helps him out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he really is winging it half the
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of where I, I always felt
like I'm much better when I'm doing that
[SPEAKER_03]: than when I get a little bit too much
structure in front of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but by having Mitch on the show,
he kind of helped me a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had like times slots and you know,
he had it all figured and mapped it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like it's, there's an evolution
to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know there's going to be another
wave because at a certain point,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a lot of people approach me about
doing other stuff and I'm kind of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard if I go to work for somebody
because I've never had that for the last
[SPEAKER_03]: 25 years or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't, I've always been the boss,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's a really hard, like someone
asking me to do what they want me to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to, I'm going to always say
no at this point because I, I just don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know if I can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally out of my element.
[SPEAKER_01]: Creative freedom, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it, it is like my favorite,
my favorite shows to put out are the ones
[SPEAKER_03]: that I don't, I come out of there feeling
like, wow, I didn't even know half the
[SPEAKER_03]: things that like, it's just, I learned so
much on my own show, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, that's a pretty cool feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's times when I, I'm like,
well, if I learned something, then I can
[SPEAKER_03]: only imagine that the people who listen to
it must have been blown away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even more because they're really not
knowing the both sides of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the question I'd love to ask a
lot of people were kind of wondering,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, why did Mitch take a step back?
[SPEAKER_01]: I, one thing I had heard was that he's
actually not so heavily involved in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis scene in general anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he works for Dark Horse Genetics now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's still in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, the difference is that
Mitch was a straight edge guy back in the
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he was literally, the guy who
would go, not, I'm not going to say he
[SPEAKER_03]: would go and beat people up, but he was
like literally part of the crew who would
[SPEAKER_03]: cruise around and be like hating on people
who were taking drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you literally turned his thing around
180 when he got into weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas, you know, I've never been that
guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always been a weed guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was a little less of a like
long-term, like I have to be a weed guy
[SPEAKER_03]: for the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is he actually quit smoking
weed for a short time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't quit completely, but he quit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he quit the show, he quit smoking
weed at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a point in his life where he felt
that he needed to center himself and take
[SPEAKER_03]: care of his family.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Mitch is, like we were talking about
earlier, when it came to putting the show
[SPEAKER_03]: together and you know, he had it all
pre-planned and typed up and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when he sees that, you know,
it's because for him, not to say that it
[SPEAKER_03]: was about money at all, but he really
couldn't put the energy into driving down
[SPEAKER_03]: from Boulder to be on the show to then not
get paid enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we really struggled when it came to
sponsors and keeping people on point and
[SPEAKER_03]: paying their bills.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm sure you've seen that
side of it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of the hardest.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing about podcasting is it's very
hard because you could sell out and go to
[SPEAKER_03]: sponsors that have nothing to do with you
and make more money.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we really only wanted to work with
products that we like and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: things that we really could stand behind
because it's very easy when you use
[SPEAKER_03]: something and you like it to tell,
to be enthusiastic about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people believe you, obviously,
because you're like, hey, I've been using
[SPEAKER_03]: this thing for two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then compared to like, oh,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to get the MailChimp
contact MailChimp, you know, that's kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of where it's hard as a podcast person.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think with Mitch, it's a little bit
of a, he's also very much moves on with
[SPEAKER_03]: his things and keeps rolling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the kind of guy who really has a hard
time letting go and giving up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm terrible about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like sometimes even when it's not
productive, I'll just keep rolling with
[SPEAKER_03]: something because I feel like,
nope, I said I was going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do it till the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just have different, different
personalities like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, we're still in contact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like there was never,
there was never an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always just a, I think a change in
his, his direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've also told him, I said,
listen, if we ever get like a real deal,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that actually is somebody paying
us to do what we're doing and not us
[SPEAKER_03]: having to figure it all out for ourselves,
then I'll, I'd love to have him back and
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully he will.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a great, I mean, that's,
that's the thing is when Mitch was with
[SPEAKER_03]: me, I really like, I could let him run the
ship for a bit and I would just be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: throw in my two cents, which would be
always the, the goofy or stupid side of
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't have to take myself too
seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now all of a sudden I feel like,
well, I can't just be the goofy guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to actually buckle down every so
often and try to get to the bottom of
[SPEAKER_03]: certain things, you know, with,
with people, with guests and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can, I can totally relate to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I feel like I'm focusing so hard
on what people are saying so that I can
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe come up with a follow up question
that I'll often listen back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: interview and just be like, I don't
remember them saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have that all the time where I
sometimes I have it where I'm in the
[SPEAKER_03]: middle and I'm thinking of the next
question and I totally blanked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just said, and I'm like, oh no,
where, where were we actually?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know I understand a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the topic of the show, who's been
your kind of your favorite guest over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I love having,
I like having passionate people on,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the guy that had on yesterday,
Kevin Jodry from wonderland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really love, I love for some reason,
I love talking to guys from new England,
[SPEAKER_03]: like Ron Wallace from the giant pumpkin
guy that I've had on the show a few times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's now a sponsor of the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of my favorite guys to talk to,
just because he's such a knowledgeable guy
[SPEAKER_03]: when it comes to soil science.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, he, and he takes it so
seriously and, and he's creating a world
[SPEAKER_03]: record, you know, pumpkins out of this,
out of the situation too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's been one of my favorite guests,
non cannabis, like I would have to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, who has been really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually like DJ shorts really cool to
have on the show because he's also coming
[SPEAKER_03]: from the heart and he's a, he's,
he's a real, you know, like a lot of times
[SPEAKER_03]: when it comes to, I think a lot,
a lot of it comes to like experiences to
[SPEAKER_03]: one and the dragonfly earth medicine are
also great people to have on the show
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's two of them as the husband
and wife team and super knowledgeable and
[SPEAKER_03]: are sticking by their guns.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of what I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like people that are have been doing
something and they got, they can relay to
[SPEAKER_03]: the listener stuff they can do that can
not only save them a ton of money,
[SPEAKER_03]: but also make them healthier and give them
a, give them a, an avenue to be able to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to take care of themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's kind of my, I feel like
what I feel like the service of the show
[SPEAKER_03]: is to, is to give people options outside
of the, I'm just going to sit here and
[SPEAKER_03]: hype up some brands for you because they
paid me to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's kind of, that's what a
lot of the podcasts I've noticed have
[SPEAKER_03]: been, you know, when it comes to growing,
when it comes to growing, because there's
[SPEAKER_03]: so much money to be made in, in,
in products, you know, and so people are
[SPEAKER_03]: always looking for ways to promote their
products and which is fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm totally down with it, but it has
to be for what I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_03]: it has to be stuff that I'm backing
because I like it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one question I thought that you'd
be the perfect person to answer is who's
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who you think has maybe not due to
their own fault, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of flown under the radar over
the years who you think should get some
[SPEAKER_01]: more credit maybe as a breeder or any
facet of the community, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: See over the years myself, you know,
it's been one of those, I think that one
[SPEAKER_03]: thing you notice in this industry is that
people that, that, you know, do it for,
[SPEAKER_03]: do it for the long, like do it for the
long haul.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta think about this question.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a tough one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people is the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people got way too much
credit in this industry where you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if you want to find some names.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, I don't want to, I don't need,
I don't need to, I don't need to throw,
[SPEAKER_03]: throw shade at anybody, but the,
you know, and the thing I've, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the people that think that a lot of
people are forgetting is Ben Drunker is my
[SPEAKER_03]: old boss, which I mean, he, he stuck his
neck out when, when it was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if you think about a guy like
him who made it possible for so many
[SPEAKER_03]: people to, to start their own businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the one thing with Ben,
if you're not, I mean, he's literally
[SPEAKER_03]: like, he's the Don, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: He is truly the Don.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now he's not that he's never been
celebrated by people and he has,
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot of times it's, it's,
it's people trying to get something out of
[SPEAKER_03]: them, but, but I really feel like that guy
took more risks in this industry than
[SPEAKER_03]: almost anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was arrested like 30 times or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he's, he's had balls of
steel.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's taken, you know, one of the greatest
stories I heard of him, my greatest,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's a lot of them, but one of the stories
I heard from him that was just shows you
[SPEAKER_03]: the kind of guy he was is there was a guy
who came to the, to the hash museum.
[SPEAKER_03]: At one point he was from Uruguay and he
was a friend of another person who was
[SPEAKER_03]: like showing him around in Europe and they
had their wallets stolen or their bags or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so his passport was stolen.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had no money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, so I guess Ben had given him
10,000 guilders.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's about $5,000 at the time so that
he could get him, get home to Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it was really expensive for tickets
and take care of himself and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that guy turned out to be the
president of Uruguay, the recent one,
[SPEAKER_03]: the guy that the really cool president
they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just to show you that kind
of like, you know, someone throws you
[SPEAKER_03]: 10,000 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to remember them forever,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm sure Ben has some extra special
credit down Uruguay now, but just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: he was just that kind of a guy,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and over the years, so many people,
including myself have like started
[SPEAKER_03]: underneath him, saw the light,
like, wait a minute, you can sell seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: and people will pay for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's something you love.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he kind of like showed everybody what
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, since he was the birth of
Syria seeds, the birth of soccer mother
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, the birth of TH seeds, the birth of
so many other ones after that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you know, just if you,
and now of course, you know, he lives in
[SPEAKER_03]: Malaysia, he's got his own Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this guy's doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think he has to, anybody has to
worry about him not doing good,
[SPEAKER_03]: but he definitely, I think his because
we're getting to that point now where
[SPEAKER_03]: America has taken over.
[SPEAKER_03]: People think of Dutch genetics as being
like not inferior for some reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, ah, you know, they were the
gatekeepers of all genetics for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did a huge service to the world
because if they didn't do that,
[SPEAKER_03]: if they didn't step up to the plate in the
eighties, we would have lost it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's so much that got at least
had a home in Amsterdam, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then could get filtered out of there
and get sent back to America.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think he's probably the biggest
influencer that gets the least amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: credit these days, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what would you say to people who claim
that the downfall in quality from Sensi is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of on his shoulders?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's, I mean, I know exactly when it
went downhill because it was it happened
[SPEAKER_03]: right when I was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically in 1993, right about the time
when I moved to, so 92, between 92 and 93,
[SPEAKER_03]: they bought out, they bought Neville's
entire collection, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So Neville was trapped and he had to get
smuggled out back from, he was in
[SPEAKER_03]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when they did that, they basically
bought his entire collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that, you know, just to finance him,
got him back to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And about a year after that, maybe two
years after that, that's when they,
[SPEAKER_03]: so Marcel, who was the main grower at the
time, I don't know who's going for Sensi
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, but there's a guy named Marcel
and he was the main grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is where the Dutch lost the plot
a long time ago is that very few of them
[SPEAKER_03]: smoked pure weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They almost all smoked tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I figured that out when I first got
there, I was like, wow, and that seems
[SPEAKER_03]: like none of these Dutch people really
know anything about weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they all just kind of, it smokes,
it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, nah, but don't you notice
that this one has a much better flavor?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was always like trying to
figure out the nuances and it's because I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't put tobacco in my weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realized quickly, like, wow,
I could, you know, I could, you could rise
[SPEAKER_03]: to the top of this industry really fast,
just, just based on the fact that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: really into what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that you, you understand the medium
that you're in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Marcel, who didn't smoke was the
main grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: He took over all of Neville's work and he
had no clue of what he was doing and he
[SPEAKER_03]: did not follow the instructions properly
and that things got haywire, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So then when Neville had to come back in
and clean it all up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was kind of the original mistake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I believe, you know, it's pretty
hard to maintain a library for 30 plus
[SPEAKER_03]: years and not expect there to be some
deviation from quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on top of that, you take into
effect that, you know, I think the other
[SPEAKER_03]: problem that they had was Dutch are very
arrogant people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't help it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just in their blood.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the way they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have a hard time taking A,
taking criticism and B, believing that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're in the wrong in any way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it comes to like breeding and
stuff, I believe that they may not reach
[SPEAKER_03]: out enough, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: To get people to keep them in line because
they feel like they know what they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that arrogance is maybe what
came through a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the thing in Holland now,
they're desperate for American genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: that are fresh, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody's looking for something new.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you go there now, every shop owner
is like, oh, Adam, Adam, Adam,
[SPEAKER_03]: we want the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you get it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, no, those days are over for
like, you guys can figure it out yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's just the way it is,
is that people are, they always thought
[SPEAKER_03]: they had the best weed there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I always noticed when I was
working with anybody who came into my
[SPEAKER_03]: store, I had the same discussion over and
over and over again, like anybody from
[SPEAKER_03]: California or from anywhere that was like
cannabis, like had a good cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_03]: already was like, hey, I came to
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't smoked any good weed,
you know, and I have to like bust out
[SPEAKER_03]: something and be like, we'll try this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, you're the only one,
you know, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd be like, no, no, there's good weed
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have to know where it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, very similar to what happens in
America now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will happen in Australia and it
will happen anywhere that it becomes legal
[SPEAKER_03]: or fully accepted because whenever there's
quantities, the quality is going to go
[SPEAKER_03]: down, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be so much out there
that you're going to have to filter
[SPEAKER_03]: through to get to the good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first shop was called CIA and that
stood for cannabis in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I broke up with my original
partner and decided to change the name of
[SPEAKER_03]: the company at that point to KGB.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were like, all right, we're not CIA
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're KGB.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was an acronym for no good buds
in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it was obviously tongue in
cheek because it was one of those things
[SPEAKER_03]: where, what do you mean there's no good
weed in Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, no, no, no, we know good weed
in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same, you know, sort of the
same now in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: People come here and they're like,
oh, there's no good weed in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, there is good weed here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is most of the stuff that's in
the dispensaries has to be touched seven
[SPEAKER_03]: or eight times before it actually gets
into you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the handling is what fucks it all up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it always adds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many things we could talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the one which piques my interest
the most, can we go back to the early days
[SPEAKER_01]: at Greenhouse where you, Aryan and Shanti
were working together?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that like?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's your opinion of those
guys as breeders per se?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, put aside the personal
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think they're pretty good breeders?
[SPEAKER_03]: Shanti is a good breeder for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Aryan, Aryan is a real,
Aryan is the epitome of what I just said,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was the Dutch are so arrogant that
they don't know what there's out there
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're, they're so convinced that
what they have is the best and they're the
[SPEAKER_03]: best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so therefore they're the best,
you know, and you're like, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, you know, he, and he was kind of
more silver spoon kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't have it as difficult as,
I mean, Shanti was, was taking big risks
[SPEAKER_03]: and growing in Africa and places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Places that were much more intense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, totally respected him when we,
when we met and, uh, I didn't really do
[SPEAKER_03]: much work with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of like, I, I, you know,
I, we were all in our own camps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, uh, I, uh, it's funny cause my friend
ran Aryan's, uh, clone operation for him,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, at one point and, uh,
you know, I'd go by his house and shake my
[SPEAKER_03]: head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what are you doing working for this
guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Working for the enemy now.
[SPEAKER_03]: This doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we were all in our own, in our own
camps at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, and, and there's,
you know, as much as people think we have
[SPEAKER_03]: bad blood between breeders and stuff,
it's like, for me, it was a different
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We both were shop owners.
[SPEAKER_03]: We both had our seed companies and my
little pet peeves with Aryan were more,
[SPEAKER_03]: my biggest pet peeve with him was,
was the fact that what I, I felt like we
[SPEAKER_03]: were getting kind of slapped in the face
just because we were foreigners,
[SPEAKER_03]: because we came there in 93 or I started
my first company and I got there in 89,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we first started the first company in
93.
[SPEAKER_03]: And about 94, I believe Aryan came into
our shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: We already knew each other because I used
to hang out, I knew him from Sensei and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wasn't like we didn't know each
other, but he walked in with a group of
[SPEAKER_03]: people and they were like looking around
at all, anything that I had that was seed
[SPEAKER_03]: related.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they grabbed all my catalogs from all
the different companies that I was
[SPEAKER_03]: repping.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they, on the way out said,
by the way, guys, you can just forget
[SPEAKER_03]: about making seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm about to, flood the market and
make them not making, so you'll never be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to keep up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he came out with his seed company
within maybe what, like three,
[SPEAKER_03]: four months after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the right away I was like,
wait a minute, why does it say since 1985
[SPEAKER_03]: on the top of this thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're in 1994 and this just
started today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this doesn't even make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and then he literally said,
you know, I confronted him on it the first
[SPEAKER_03]: time I could.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Hey, what's up with this since
1985 stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because pretty sure you did not exist when
I got here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when I met you, you did not even
have a shop at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, and his story to me was that,
well, you know, I was watering plants for
[SPEAKER_03]: my dad in 1985 at 2000 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to water every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, that is, it should say
the, and this is the funny part is he
[SPEAKER_03]: always would bust Shanti Baba's balls and
call him the water boy, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, and so I was like,
Hey, wait a minute, aren't you just a,
[SPEAKER_03]: we should say water boy since 1985,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he got so pissed off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was like, you know, that was,
that was my little pet peeve and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing personal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I feel like you need to be
honest about some things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it comes to like your starting
date, that's, that's kind of basic,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, if you're,
you're going to tell people that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding since 85, but you're actually
talking about watering plants since 85.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's like, I can say I was growing
a Phototron at 85, but I would never,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I'm not going to include that
into my, my data.
[SPEAKER_03]: My starting point of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my little pet peeve with him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course it was just the,
the, the idea that, you know, like
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody says, you know, you buy cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you don't really buy cups,
but you do buy cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a different way of buying cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just when you, if you rent,
if you rent the hall that the cup is in
[SPEAKER_03]: and you supply the hotel rooms for the
people, when you do all of that,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, you're going to win a cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of what his angle was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just more of the, the obvious,
this way it wasn't, there was never like a
[SPEAKER_03]: here's $10,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty much when you buy you $10,000
with the stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was always felt like kind of like
a high school thing where, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: stoners versus the jocks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was when I was a kid, that was the
way we, we, our mentality was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here we are in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm still felt like I was back into
that high school feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm back on that, but shouldn't the
stoners be in charge of the stoner thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, we were kind of like back on
that classification or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's, um, that's an interesting
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think there might even be a
written article out there kind of talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about what you mentioned and the way
Ariane has obtained a few cups over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years by interesting means.
[SPEAKER_01]: But something I did want to ask you is
sadly, you know, Franco's no longer with
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think that means in regards to
their output of new strains?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I mean, the thing is they,
they, uh, definitely lost a good guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause he was, he, he's what kind of
grounded them with cannabis again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause at least you had somebody who,
you know, smoked a lot of weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: smoked a lot of hash, had a very,
um, was very into it and, and a hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: percent kind of, you know, cause that's
what you, I mean, that's the thing about
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and all, you know, out of like
out of the whole crew, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like, uh, he was definitely the one
that kind of connected to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: With people better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, I really think it's,
it's a sad, it was sad because the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the timing of course is the thing about,
you know, there's never, there's never a
[SPEAKER_03]: good time, of course, but it's also like
just as this whole industry is about to
[SPEAKER_03]: explode, you know, uh, to, to lose
somebody like to, to lose out on that,
[SPEAKER_03]: it sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you don't get to see a lot of things
I'm sure he wanted to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you know, I think they'll,
they'll, you know, the thing about them is
[SPEAKER_03]: that a lot of times there's not a lot,
there was never enough vetting with a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of their strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a lot of times when
something was hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when train wreck was a good
example where guy brought train wreck to
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave me a cut of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when he, after he gave me a cut,
he said, Ari had just offered him like
[SPEAKER_03]: 10,000 guilders for the same or euros for
the same cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, do what you got to do,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like if you want to sell it to
them, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it kind of sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I thought we had this deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you were going to bring it to me and
we're going to work together and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to make some, something from it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so in the end, I know he didn't
give them the train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave them something else and called it
train wreck, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ari and ran with that ball so hard
and, uh, kind of put his own foot in his
[SPEAKER_03]: own mouth when it came to the whole thing,
because he, everything he described about
[SPEAKER_03]: it didn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was talking about fat leaves and sweet
plants and just all these things that were
[SPEAKER_03]: like, no, that doesn't sound like train
wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if he had said silvery colored
leaves and thinner and short and fast and
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of a mentholated something smell,
then you would have been like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, that's the train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So he kind of like, there wasn't,
there was always this thing of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: if I just pay somebody a bunch of money,
they're going to give me the real deal and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm never going to have to, you know,
and I'll be, and I'll be the guy,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was always like, it helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're, if you're involved and you
actually know what train wreck was before
[SPEAKER_03]: you put it up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a way, like he really kind of like
fucked himself up there where even
[SPEAKER_03]: describing the seeds didn't make sense
because if you've bred with train wreck,
[SPEAKER_03]: you realize it always produces small
seeds, just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're, I mean, maybe if you
crossed it with a certain male,
[SPEAKER_03]: you might get bigger seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I've noticed is always when I was
making seeds of it, it always came out
[SPEAKER_03]: quite small and dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he was explaining them as these
gigantic and luscious seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, as a breeder, you're like,
wow, that doesn't sound like train wreck
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was, I feel like that's,
that's, you know, something they can learn
[SPEAKER_03]: to maybe do to improve their selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a lot of the, I mean,
a lot of companies are going to,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of companies just don't care at a
certain point though, too, because their
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers are just so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we're on the topic of selection,
what are some of your preferred methods
[SPEAKER_01]: for selecting a good male?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do you have like a go-to trait?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of people say, you know,
they love the stem rub, good stem rubs,
[SPEAKER_01]: a really good indication to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the things you use?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the late flowering males that
have, I mean, obviously smell is
[SPEAKER_03]: important.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your first thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: First thing would be smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you kind of like even decide to
think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: After that, it's a lot of visual cues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Later flowering ones are better that they
don't put, they don't finish out too
[SPEAKER_03]: quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: The trike development is also important.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bulletproofness, you know,
and also what I look for is like a rubbery
[SPEAKER_03]: quality to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like sometimes you get like papery plants
and sometimes you get rubbery plants is
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of how I would judge them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the papery ones tend to produce more
harsh and not such nice plants that burn
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ones that are more rubbery tend to
be more like they burn slower and oilier
[SPEAKER_03]: and they have a vibe to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So usually go for like a male that has a
kind of a rubbery quality to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Resilient, late flowering, trikes help
usually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, you know what else is,
I mean, I haven't done it too much,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if you do like colloidal silver
treatment and kind of try to flip them to
[SPEAKER_03]: get an idea of what they mean,
they might be like as a female.
[SPEAKER_03]: Haven't done that a lot though.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a more recent development,
which I've done in a few rounds just
[SPEAKER_03]: because it was like, oh, well,
shit, I don't really do feminized
[SPEAKER_03]: normally, but it is a good way to test the
sort of the ability of the plant to resist
[SPEAKER_03]: hermaphrodism in general, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like if a plant is easily flipped where
it just instantly goes, then it's almost
[SPEAKER_03]: like a bad sign, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a, that shows you that it
doesn't take much to convert that plant
[SPEAKER_03]: and to make that plant go hermy on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's as a male, I mean, that's the
thing is with males, it's really about
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers though, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of people, they bank too much
on one particular male.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unless you know and it's been tried
and true, it's actually better to sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: hit up like one female with say three or
four males, maybe even five males.
[SPEAKER_03]: And keep your numbers small on your
original round and then go through all of
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people think a lot of times,
especially when it comes to males too,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like, you know, they're really,
really focusing on the females and then
[SPEAKER_03]: they're like, oh, okay, but I got one male
and then they're gonna use that on
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, there's a lot to,
it's 50% of the information, you know what
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're not 100% sure that that male
is a stable one, you're kinda shooting in
[SPEAKER_03]: the dark at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay, that's actually a really
interesting idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard before, but it certainly
makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, the thing is it's a lot,
like, you know, if you, like I heard,
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard that like the cookie fam is trying
to find a male and they've gone through
[SPEAKER_03]: like 1500 males to try to, they're still
not happy with anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of the way you have to be,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You really have to be super duper
skeptical when it comes to males.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem is a lot of times people
like, the key is to flower them out
[SPEAKER_03]: completely before you select them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really hard for a lot of people
to do because they usually are,
[SPEAKER_03]: are trying to use the original time that
they flower it, like the very beginning of
[SPEAKER_03]: the flowering to use that in a breeding
project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And usually what I'll do is keep my males
completely separate, have a whole room
[SPEAKER_03]: full of males and let them go really till
the end, till they're like withering
[SPEAKER_03]: almost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can kind of get to the point
where you can really see the bud structure
[SPEAKER_03]: of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can collect plenty of pollen
to do a small run, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that way the pollen that you're
collecting is not the, because the problem
[SPEAKER_03]: is in the very, very first flowers to go
off is not as, is not the best pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that pollen is, is usually not
quite matured enough and it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: a preflower thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I usually wait until they're really
like dumping, dumping, dumping,
[SPEAKER_03]: then I'll collect a little bit of pollen
from those and then use that on my first
[SPEAKER_03]: round.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once I know though, if it's a
different story, if I know that like if
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a male that's tried and true,
I'll put the plant in the room to make
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't brush those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if I'm doing production, I let the
plants just do their thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way better results than trying to do it by
hand, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I'm going to do a test run,
like when I'm trying to figure out a male,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do all those by hand because it's,
it's stupid to try to make 10,000 seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: just to figure out that they're not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, well, that's a big waste of
energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of the idea of the way we
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, that's another interesting
idea with the immature pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haven't heard that one either,
but one I want to kind of look into
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question I want to ask though,
when you do do your pollinations,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you put the male and the female in the
room together from day one or do you like
[SPEAKER_01]: to stagger it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I stagger it usually.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends though, like if it's a normal
like eight or nine weeks a week or then
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll stagger it by about a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's like a 10 or 12 week or then I'll
stagger it by about two and a half,
[SPEAKER_03]: three weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but then, you know, what I'd usually
do is like, there's, there's certain
[SPEAKER_03]: plants so that I know that I just have to
have done it a few times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost do the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to flower the male before,
because if I wait to, if I try to put them
[SPEAKER_03]: in the room at the same time, they'll end
up coming in late, pollinating late,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you end up with a lot less
mature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you ended up with like a whole bunch of
those half the seeds of the flat bottoms
[SPEAKER_03]: and white seeds and you know, it's just
driving that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a way I'd, I'd tell, I'd rather it
to be on early than late.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I hate it when the, when they get
pollinated and they've already hitting on
[SPEAKER_03]: like say four or five weeks, there's just
not enough time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need, you need a good six solid weeks
to produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's how I feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if it's less than six weeks,
I feel like I'm under cooking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on the James Bean interview,
he referenced that you might be doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: little project in the future whereby
you're releasing some pollen in
[SPEAKER_01]: combination with a few different crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that's still going to go
ahead?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, but not as quickly as I thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually that I had, I had my,
one of my, one of my projects get sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: stifled in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lost a, I lost a particular place just
like we do to the man himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I, a lot of my breeding projects,
all my breeding projects are underground
[SPEAKER_03]: still, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't trust any, I can't do it
in a facility because of the protocols are
[SPEAKER_03]: so extreme that it's just how am I going
to get, you know, I can't even work with
[SPEAKER_03]: my material because all of a sudden every
little gram of the material, whether it be
[SPEAKER_03]: seed or stem or whatever is all being
organized and classified.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so I do everything still on the
underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which puts me at risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately the, that particular
project, which is called everybody loves
[SPEAKER_03]: Bodie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took some Bodie.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bodie had given me a tester of something
that he hadn't released yet, which was
[SPEAKER_03]: called Jasmine cat piss is a snow lotus
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got a really consistent batch,
like everything on it was just like the
[SPEAKER_03]: males and the females looked almost
identical.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I took two males.
[SPEAKER_03]: I only, I only had 12 plants to begin with
or 12 seeds to begin with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And out of those 12 seeds, I got like nine
plants, I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from those two good males and
then the rest couple of males that were a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit wonky, but ended up with this
one male, short fat trikey for,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, really decent little plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that male, I managed to keep the male.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was lucky because even though I lost the
place because it's Colorado, they let,
[SPEAKER_03]: they let, they left 36 of the smallest
clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically they, they took everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they, but it's always funny because
when you're like compared to what it used
[SPEAKER_03]: to be back in the day, they take
everything, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Take all your lights, take all your
plants, take everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: This time it was like, they took all your
plants, but they said, Oh, you have a,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have a, you have a medical record.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a medical card for 36.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll leave you with 36, but we're
going to leave you with the smallest 36.
[SPEAKER_03]: And luckily one of those was the male that
I was going to use for the pollen,
[SPEAKER_03]: my mate, but I, but there's not enough
time for, for this particular round.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, the idea on the Everybody Loves
Bode project was to do a sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: open-ended breeding project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that way, whoever, I was going to
do a short amount of, like I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe 30 of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the idea would be you have a
bunch of F1s, a few, less, but a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: F2s and a couple F3s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the pollen that I used on the
original F1 crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way you could take that project
and go backwards with it a little bit and
[SPEAKER_03]: go, you know, the idea would be as
breeders, you buy it, you have all these
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds to go through and you have the
original pollen off the male that I use so
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can always go and use your own
back crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it'd be fun because I wanted to,
because Bode's way of growing or way of
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding is a little bit, I wouldn't say
it's different, but he definitely kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: does that on his own.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has this, he does everything to F2 and
then he leaves it at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you as a grower get kind of like,
to me it's sort of like you're in the
[SPEAKER_03]: middle, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not quite there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to go, like F1s are a little bit
more explosive.
[SPEAKER_03]: F2s are a little bit more, you start to
get into like camps, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have the two different, you'll have
more phenotypical, you have less
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotypical expression as you would in
the F1, but you'll have groups,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that are more defined.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of just thought, so it's kind of
like a different way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the idea was that you'd have to buy
the whole thing, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You buy, so you buy the, a couple hundred
seeds at one given time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have these projects that are,
then I wanted to, I mostly wanted to do it
[SPEAKER_03]: to see what direction people would take
them, you know, that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then tell everybody these are all,
you can use all this stuff, do whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: you want with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna, I'm not trying to isolate
it and tell anybody you can't use it,
[SPEAKER_03]: because also it was from Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I wanted to give 25% of that to
the charity of Bodhi's Choice,
[SPEAKER_03]: which he chose a group from Oaxaca.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a place down in Oaxaca,
which he, he would hand deliver the check.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're gonna do it, but I'm probably
gonna do it next year, because it's one of
[SPEAKER_03]: those things where you can't release that
kind of a project without feeling like
[SPEAKER_03]: it's where it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and do you see this as being a
common thing in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have seen a few little pollen
releases here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this, again, you getting on board the
next wave?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I think it's definitely
gonna happen, because the reality is,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is, like when I do a, whenever I have
a question and answer thing at a seminar
[SPEAKER_03]: or something, that's one of the main
questions is selecting males.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because we've all shared all these
common female plants over the years,
[SPEAKER_03]: very, very few breeders share males.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they do, it gets usually,
it's like, so for instance, like a good
[SPEAKER_03]: example is the G13 haze male that Soma
uses on a lot of his crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave that same male to DNA who then
used it in a bunch of their crosses,
[SPEAKER_03]: who then gave it to Paradise Seeds who
used it in their crosses, who gave it to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like every Delta 9 used that same male in
a bunch of their crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just like, kind of like,
and so for me, that was like completely
[SPEAKER_03]: off limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I will never use that male
because then we're all, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're all in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas the females, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody can use the same female,
but as long as there's a different male in
[SPEAKER_03]: the mix, it kind of puts everybody in
their own direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's been kind of the main
reason why everybody hasn't been doing it
[SPEAKER_03]: because they kind of want to keep their
thing unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also see that people are willing to
pay because, you know, half a gram of
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen is plenty here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do a lot of damage with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, the market will dictate
where it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just think there hasn't been enough
breeders out there to make it worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nowadays, since everybody's a breeder,
just like everybody is a DJ, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and everybody's a podcaster, I just happen
to be all three, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, it's like, it's kind of the,
uh, it is kind of, uh, inevitable that
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to become another base for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, who else is doing that
was, um, DJ short son, I think was JD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I was interested in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been thinking about this idea a lot
and obviously not quite entirely related
[SPEAKER_01]: to the pollen idea because probably a lot
of more new breeders, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: aspiring breeders is going to be people
interested in that as for like top end
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders or already selling seeds,
they're probably less likely to be buying
[SPEAKER_01]: that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the question remains, you know,
given you just highlighted how males from
[SPEAKER_01]: other people do get used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's, it's a bit of a stretch
to call yourself a breeder in that
[SPEAKER_01]: situation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think fundamentally when you break
it down, being a breeder means there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some form of selection involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were just to use a male from
someone else, you didn't select it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like a coin only, like where's
the selection taking place?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, and again, that you're a
replicator at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I used to, that, that was my
other little joke I used to do with
[SPEAKER_03]: Ariane.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Ariane, you're not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a replicator, you know,
cause that's all you're doing is
[SPEAKER_03]: replicating other work that other people
have done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I kind of feel like that is,
uh, yeah, that's a different class.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's, it's like the, um,
it's like the meme where I forgot exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: how it goes, but it was like, you know,
I need to, like the guy that was under the
[SPEAKER_03]: car and he's like, I need, I need two
packs of this and whatever and stickers
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've done less, you know, I've made a
seed company out of less.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of where we're at where,
you know, and that's one of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: where you notice you see people's gears
turning when they're, when the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the first time they're understanding like
that people are paying money for these
[SPEAKER_03]: beans and oh, well, if they're paying that
much money, then I should do this,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and that that's definitely not
the inspiration that you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need the inspiration should be,
you know, you, you want to, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you love the plant enough that you can,
yeah, take the energy to, to waste a bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of time and, and, and to get to a point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, that's, it's never on the
first round.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like, that's one of the reasons
also why this whole everyone loves Bodhi
[SPEAKER_03]: project.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, okay, I'm not, I'm not as
content yet with where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I want to take it to the next
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I am going to do though, is a,
a line called Sage master select,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I'll have my first round of,
uh, of things coming on the, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: at the emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll have six crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have six crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a male, a Sage male that I,
that we selected here from, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's like green onion.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got like a green onion flavor to it,
uh, that it imparts on everything,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of a, it's kind of like
somewhere between garlic bud and an onion
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor, which is a little, a little bit
different than the original Sage,
[SPEAKER_03]: which has more of a sandalwood vibe,
but it's amazingly vigorous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and I've just did six crosses,
but I did a bunch more, but I got six that
[SPEAKER_03]: I've selected out that I'm going to,
or on that I'm going to bring into the
[SPEAKER_03]: emerald cup this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one question that we got sent in a lot
was, and one I kind of looked into and was
[SPEAKER_01]: interested in myself on the THC site,
it says, um, that you guys have won a few
[SPEAKER_01]: cups with the underdog Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that one differ from Lumpa's
underdog?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, is it different?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, John and I had the, we,
we, it was a moment in time, a classic
[SPEAKER_03]: where, you know, we, we didn't know each
other, but I kept hearing from people
[SPEAKER_03]: like, yeah, Lumpa's mad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you, you know, the underdog thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was actually, uh, because I had to,
okay, here it's, it's a weird,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a, it's a, it's a weird one too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause so basically I got underdog from,
uh, from JJ and AJ about nine years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got it with, I got Guava Kim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Underdog, Corey Haim cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's two different star dogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: This regular star dog and the Corey Haim
cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Lumpa, I think Lumpa's is like a sour
Kush cross more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and it, so he, and he named his
underdog Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the problem was that,
okay, so ours was just the underdog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my partner Doug in Amsterdam,
he, he basically put Kush behind anything
[SPEAKER_03]: that had OG in it or Kush because the
customer base in Holland, like they just
[SPEAKER_03]: all did.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the hype word of the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Kush, if it doesn't have Kush,
we don't want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, because when he called it underdog,
people didn't get it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, so it was really like a name put on it
to, for selling points more than,
[SPEAKER_03]: and not just because it, it had Kush in
it, but it just wasn't, or it didn't even
[SPEAKER_03]: have Kush in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was underdog, which that's,
and that's the funny part about the whole,
[SPEAKER_03]: when I first got Kush and I first got
sour, which was in about 99, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought them back from, from,
from the States and I brought it to
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I got there, I had wrapped them,
I'd put them into groups and I'd wrap them
[SPEAKER_03]: with, uh, one of those, uh, garbage bags
things, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Little zip ties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I'd wrapped them into two groups
and then I wrote on them and just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know how, you know, how small that
area is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like wrote with a permanent marker,
like OG on one and then SD on the other
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I got there, I couldn't fucking
read them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could not read.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know which ones are which,
but I'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I grew them out and they're damn
close.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you don't really know what's going
on, like you have no idea at zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the funny part was that our,
uh, that Soma had completely fucked up my
[SPEAKER_03]: head when it came to the, to the diesels
because he had came up with his diesel,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was purple and grapefruit smelling
and just had nothing to do with sour
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'd only heard about sour diesel,
even though my friends who were the ones
[SPEAKER_03]: who were growing it back in the States
that I'd met when I was in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_03]: they never brought it with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were always scared to fly into
Amsterdam with weed, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so until 99, until I actually went
and got the cuts, I didn't ever try it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I flew back, I got the cuts,
flew back, grew them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it took me like a good two runs before
I was a hundred percent convinced.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a good, um, now I can see the
difference obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's like totally like,
now I see when other people don't see the
[SPEAKER_03]: difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, the whole underdog story got a
little bit confusing too, because there
[SPEAKER_03]: was, um, uh, you know, there was like that
version that he had, he put out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I guess those guys lost like AJ
and JJ and everybody lost that original
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I put out, then when I finally
got JJ to look at the underdog that I had,
[SPEAKER_03]: he claimed it was the Corey Haim cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now it got really confusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the Corey Haim cut and I had this
Stardog and I had the guava.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, so it got a little confusing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was one of those.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that to this, I mean, I know that
they're totally different plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: but people will be confused for eons to
come.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will never get, that will never get
totally separated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll think just because I've been losing
the original underdog and then Lumpa
[SPEAKER_03]: having his version of underdog and then TH
seeds Europe, which I kind of have to
[SPEAKER_03]: separate because I'm not involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Directly with what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send them, I will send them stuff
and, uh, they can work with it every so
[SPEAKER_03]: often, but I'm not like on the inner
workings of a lot of the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, for instance, that underdog is
the same cut that I left them with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know what I left them with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, but to this day, yeah,
now it's just hard for me to know because
[SPEAKER_03]: until I can get them to get me that back
over to here and be able to show that to
[SPEAKER_03]: AJ or JJ and AJ and have them confirm
whether or not it is or it isn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, I think also there's a
little bit of the hoping I don't have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I hope he doesn't really have it
still.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever it is, the thing we have was
really, really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why it keeps winning out in
Europe and stuff also.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, there's certainly been some
whispers that the clone, which goes around
[SPEAKER_01]: as the, you know, original sour is maybe
not the original.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on this one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, interestingly enough,
next week I'll be hanging out with the bro
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm trying to get the bro to come on
my show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bro is really like the key to the
whole sour story because he was one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: financiers of the of the whole project
back in the day because it was literally,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a bunch of guys who are kids,
really, when you think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then my friend who is the bro,
who is kind of like guiding them,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and helping them with this,
with that project.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically by paying overpriced amounts
to them at all times just to keep it in
[SPEAKER_03]: house, you know, they still have the cut
off the original, which they're getting
[SPEAKER_03]: analyzed now so that we'll have a
baseline.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cut that I have came from from Hal,
who is the guy that worked for them,
[SPEAKER_03]: or kind of he's the guy who popped the
bean, the original bean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it comes to the sours,
like, for instance, that AJ's put out,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's different, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it might be an F1, but it's
definitely not exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think for the most part,
most people haven't seen it lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if they haven't been if they
weren't in New York in the 90s and to the
[SPEAKER_03]: late 90s to the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Early 2000s, then they probably have seen
a version which is not the original.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more than convinced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a sentiment I've heard
expressed commonly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also hard because of the fact
that the sour was never a stable plant to
[SPEAKER_03]: begin with, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stability was never its highlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was never its focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like the fact that it would throw
nanners and be very hard to breed with and
[SPEAKER_03]: get a lot of kind of had a bunch of
batches of seeds that were, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: very low germ rates, things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think sour has ever been one of
the most stable cornerstone plants to work
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it came as a mistake.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's part of the deal, you know,
whenever you're working with material that
[SPEAKER_03]: came from from from a great mystery in the
sky, then, you know, there's it's hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: decide whether or not that's going to be
the longest or not even decide.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to to rely on that as being a
super stable thing long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's a little fantasy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a little fantasy,
too, when it comes to sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_03]: though, as far as like when you're 17
years old and you're at a concert in New
[SPEAKER_03]: York and you're super blazed and you smoke
something and it's the best thing you've
[SPEAKER_03]: ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you're in your 40s and you smoked
a ton of weed in between that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may take you may in your mind have a
little bit more you may think of that as
[SPEAKER_03]: being a little bit more of a amazing thing
than it really was or different than it
[SPEAKER_03]: really was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a question I do want to run by in
relation to one of the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: heavyweights that you made, the MKUltra.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first heard that Kana Tonic was
had MKUltra in it, I was a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: surprised because when you look at the
overall cross, it just doesn't really seem
[SPEAKER_01]: to jump out on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've seen it,
but since then, the guys who made it have
[SPEAKER_01]: come out and said, like, oh, no,
we got the genetics wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually these other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you did you kind of suspect that from
the start or were you kind of?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was I was a little yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, part of me was like,
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then a part of me was like,
well, I don't see how.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree on that because I the thing is
when it first came out, OK, so resin
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, which was the the son in law of
Soma, Alex and Alex is like notorious for
[SPEAKER_03]: for flipping names and doing crazy stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wasn't so I already was a little
little concerned when he first told me
[SPEAKER_03]: that that's what they use, because also I
felt like he he knew that if he said it
[SPEAKER_03]: was something of mine, that it would be
well, like he he could he could say that
[SPEAKER_03]: would make me excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for instance, which I was at the
beginning, I was like, wow, we actually
[SPEAKER_03]: had meetings with Bayer, you know,
over it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like one of those like we're going
to like all of a sudden it was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: wow, this could be the next big thing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But part of me knew like out of the gate
that it was like having a kid,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like when you have if you have a kid
and it's not your kid, part of you will
[SPEAKER_03]: accept that as your kid just because you
get into it, you go into that drive,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Your body.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to deny it.
[SPEAKER_03]: In your mind, if you accept it,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't want a kid, you may never
accept it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's sort of the same idea where this
is, you know, somebody tells you that your
[SPEAKER_03]: plant produced something that is now being
considered by Bayer Pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_03]: because of the fact that they're looking
for the next big CBD project or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, whoa, this is major news.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also when we when we went to that
meeting, I totally was like, I would never
[SPEAKER_03]: want to pay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never, ever want to work with any
kind of large pharmaceutical corporation.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is horrible, you know, so kind of
part of me is happy that it's not involved
[SPEAKER_03]: just because it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I wouldn't say I'm happy,
but it is kind of like.
[SPEAKER_03]: People, whoever whatever genetics it's
responsible for, need to be clearly,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, get the get the reputation for
it, because it is going to send a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people on the wrong direction if they're
going to buy MK Ultra Seeds, hoping to
[SPEAKER_03]: find the next Kanatonic mother plant,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be probably mistaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, while we're on the topic of CBD
plants and kind of breeding programs,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you if you were to do some CBD
offerings, what would they be in regards
[SPEAKER_01]: to the CBD to THC chemo type?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of people think that that's
kind of where the real magic lies,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in that ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, really, like so in nature,
if you like, so if you have a field of
[SPEAKER_03]: 10000 or 100000 plants and you let them
just cross breed and open pollinate,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you had, say, for instance,
you had a lot as high CBD plants in that
[SPEAKER_03]: in that field and you had a lot of high
THC plants in that field and you let them
[SPEAKER_03]: go a couple of years in a row and they
continuously cross bred open pollination
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, you will naturally end up with
a pretty much a one to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of feel like that is the most
homeostatic sort of part of like that is
[SPEAKER_03]: literally the balance right there,
the perfect balance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything else is adjustments on that
scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some patients might need a two to one
or they might need a 10 to one,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: But usually most of the magic happens in a
one to one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just that just seems like it
should be that way anyway, because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: fact that you're like, OK, well,
that makes sense, because we're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about entourage effect and the fact that
they need it's like very hard when it
[SPEAKER_03]: comes to like what percentage do they
need.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like if you and it's very rare to very
few conditions are super negatively
[SPEAKER_03]: affected by having an equal ratio,
sometimes not working as effectively.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the most part, it's almost most
people are thinking CBD is like this cure
[SPEAKER_03]: all and that they're both equally.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both THC and CBD, both equally are
effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: THC being more effective than most.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny, too, because in the beginning,
everybody thought THC was the godsend sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of mirror miracle thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden, CBD is and now
THC is bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, no, it's all pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on top of that, you get the combo
where it's like when when they're both
[SPEAKER_03]: there is when it all works, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'm pretty sure one to one is
your magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like Harlequin's a great one to one
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one is like if you make anything
with that plant and you give it to a
[SPEAKER_03]: patient, it almost always works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what are your opinions on phylos
and the way it's kind of interacting or
[SPEAKER_01]: should I say, altering the way kind of
certain interactions or crosses are going
[SPEAKER_01]: down between breeders?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, maybe you would do a
certain cross in your mind, but then the
[SPEAKER_01]: phylos reveals that, you know,
one of the parents isn't really what you
[SPEAKER_01]: thought it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's no longer an ideal cross,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think all that plays into the
scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: Net positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard some people who are a little
bit against the whole phylos thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, I'm 100 percent positive on
the fact that it's just good that we can
[SPEAKER_03]: have this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you just can't take anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also got to look beyond the numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where I get scared when people
are breeders and they're like totally only
[SPEAKER_03]: working off phylos.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, OK, but take it to effect that,
you know, sour diesel was a mistake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush was a mistake.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all mistakes, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were all never bred on purpose
for anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether or not they the numbers would
have made sense is, you know, that's like
[SPEAKER_03]: who knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I think you got to like be happy
that we actually can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I do like the fact that they
created the galaxy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few things in there that I'm a
little bit like, OK, well, that doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: seem to make any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also opens up a lot of things where
you're like, well, yeah, we knew that all
[SPEAKER_03]: along.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now at least this is making this so we
know that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: My problem with phylos, I guess I wouldn't
say I have a problem because I've been on
[SPEAKER_03]: the show a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but what I can see is a problem
with people is is the intention
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody's a bit nervous about,
which is like, OK, so what are you going
[SPEAKER_03]: to do with all this info?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of where it's a little
we're in a weird zone now because we've
[SPEAKER_03]: been so anti.
[SPEAKER_03]: Writing things down as growers and
breeders, you know, it's been like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, just keep it all in my head,
you know, because you don't really need to
[SPEAKER_03]: have something written down that says you
were growing in that facility five years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so we've always been a little bit more
underground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it in your head kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now everybody's like information
junkies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like you can you can overload
it to the point where you don't have that
[SPEAKER_03]: information irrelevant at a certain point,
because you're like it doesn't matter if
[SPEAKER_03]: it still tastes like shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like if you take these two plants,
put them together and get the perfect
[SPEAKER_03]: balance of all the cannabinoids that you
were looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it tastes like ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then what's the point?
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tools are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just use them wisely, you know,
and would you kind of express the same
[SPEAKER_01]: sentiment for labs and all, you know,
like the it's not so new anymore,
[SPEAKER_01]: but being able to test the sex of
seedlings and whatnot, is that the type of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing you would look into as a breeder or
are you still more so just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I know much more hands on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still much more hands on and I'll use
test results more or less if I feel like I
[SPEAKER_03]: need to confirm something.
[SPEAKER_03]: More than anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nowadays, I mean, it's it's if you
have access, like if you can have a GC in
[SPEAKER_03]: your in your facility and be able to hand
off samples to somebody who that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: they do all day and they love to do it
because the Lord knows I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you can do that and give somebody
else the opportunity to help you sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's I think it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when it comes to like, like,
you know, I have guys who they run through
[SPEAKER_03]: all their stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll do a thousand plants and they'll
just look for the one or two percent that
[SPEAKER_03]: have super high turp out of the gate and
then focus on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're if you need to do that,
yeah, like if you if you're trying to go
[SPEAKER_03]: through some large numbers, but also kind
of feel like.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, can't like the whole never judge
a book by its cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have seeds and you go through
them all, there will be some strains that
[SPEAKER_03]: just produce ugly seeds that look like
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you went on all visuals and you
then you'd also lose out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think when you're doing the testing,
you know, if you're if you're able to hone
[SPEAKER_03]: in and save yourself a lot of time,
that is worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if if it's if you're not if you're if
it's not if it's not that critical and you
[SPEAKER_03]: think it's still better to kind of go
through everything by hand and give
[SPEAKER_03]: everything a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you might be missing out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be missing out, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, that's and that's that's a
sentiment I've heard expressed by a few
[SPEAKER_01]: people who I regard their opinion quite
highly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the most memorable quotes I
heard was that, you know, like we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not dealing with tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like it's so uniform.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just weed out the runs as soon as
they appear, because a lot of the times
[SPEAKER_01]: the runs are the best ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's like literally like Sage is a
good example.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was selected off of the I have to
start my car up because I'm running out of
[SPEAKER_03]: power on the phone.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like Sage was the selected the
original Sage that we selected.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friend Mojave had it was just like the
smallest plant in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like kind of in the worst spot,
but it had the most amazing smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he really like focused on that like,
OK, well, I'm going to run this one second
[SPEAKER_03]: round.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he did it the second round,
it was in a better position.
[SPEAKER_03]: It vegged a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't like it never was like a it
was never about it being like the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very vigorous, but it wasn't
necessarily the biggest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, it turned out to be
the winner out of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you'd gone by that fact that it was
the runt of the litter at that point,
[SPEAKER_03]: it would have never made it to the
fruition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great real life example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that, you know, there's
probably a few people who fall into this
[SPEAKER_01]: category as you, but having had access to
arguably some of the best stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially, you know, during the early
years, a lot of people would kill to have
[SPEAKER_01]: stock from that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of all that stuff, what to you stood
out as like some of the best stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you probably don't have it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But was there anything you grew back in
the day and you just like in your mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, damn, that was that was the
killer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there was actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sadly enough, it was one of the first
things I ever grew when I when I worked at
[SPEAKER_03]: Sensei when they did that transition,
which was in 91, I believe it was around
[SPEAKER_03]: 9192.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they did that transition,
it was they basically bought they had all
[SPEAKER_03]: of Neville stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They brought that into the they brought
that into the mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was cleaning out the drawers and I.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was cleaning out the drawers and then
I found this pack and it said four and
[SPEAKER_03]: more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most people are familiar with four
way, which came out 90s, which is a four
[SPEAKER_03]: way Indica hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had come out with a thing called four
and more, which is a four way sativa
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I took that pack and grew them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is like, again, like the first
indoor grow that I had under my like I was
[SPEAKER_03]: growing for them at Sensei.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is like the first one of my
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every single one of them is mutated,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like they had buds growing on the
stems, buds growing in the middle of the
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves, you know, the kind of things that
now is no big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see it one, you know, once in every
couple of thousand plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at that time it was like, whoa,
this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I wasn't really
recognizing the fact that even though it
[SPEAKER_03]: was like a sativa, it was growing like
pretty much like a pineapple, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: small, had very little stem to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all mutated and weird, had a weird
color to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like a brownie kind of gray color.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, so it wasn't very vibrant,
very little hair, like had almost no hairs
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then when I harvested it, I just wasn't
really thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of cut it down, harvested it,
hung it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I lit, like the first time
when I smoked it, it was like pure haze,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was one of those things where it was
like the ultimate, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where, you know, grows like a little
pineapple, indica, solid bud, has
[SPEAKER_03]: literally buds growing on the stems and
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just the vigor on it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I started to smoke it,
I was like, holy shit, that is like a pure
[SPEAKER_03]: haze taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, I kind of remember like
looking back at the stump and then smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: the joint and looking back at the stump
and going like, I probably should have
[SPEAKER_03]: like not cut that down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have probably kept that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I never to this day have ever had
anything like that where the combination
[SPEAKER_03]: of the growth pattern and the fact that it
had such an extreme sativa, like hazy
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor, and yet, you know, probably would
have been the easiest plant to grow in
[SPEAKER_03]: like a sea of green method or something at
that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, you know, and that plant,
that four and more was, that was I think
[SPEAKER_03]: the last pack ever because when I opened
up the drawer and found them, they were
[SPEAKER_03]: like, oh, wow, I didn't even know we had
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, you can take that home with
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took it home, grew it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure enough, never again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And plus, even if you could get a pack of
those, I don't think you'll ever get that
[SPEAKER_03]: particular pheno just because of the fact
that it's a four way hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fact of knowing which direction
it's actually going in is going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the, the, what actually we say
it, the predecessor golden ticket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just like, wow, this is like just
came out of left field.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember that it was such a
contrast of what I was expecting because
[SPEAKER_03]: when it was growing, it didn't really have
a lot of smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of like low, low on the totem
pole, but it really popped out when you
[SPEAKER_03]: burned it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, wow, like, whoa, what's
that's coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's getting me like so differently than
I thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you think there was any kind of
secret to the success of all the gear
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville put out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, was it really as simple as just the
stock he had to work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that pure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think he really was like,
you know, pretty phenomenal breeder?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the thing is he's a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, he, he, like a little bit like how
Simon was to Simon from serious seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simon's a Falcon breeder, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you're breeding animals first,
you kind of already have that baseline
[SPEAKER_03]: figured out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I believe part of it,
I think part of it was the fact that he
[SPEAKER_03]: was a junkie, you know, and that he had a
real hard head and he really had to really
[SPEAKER_03]: work for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of think that was part of the deal
was, you know, like I'm not, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: junkie junkies are driven people,
you know, they're 100% driven because they
[SPEAKER_03]: continue down that road regard,
you know, with nothing's going to stop
[SPEAKER_03]: them mentality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that may have added to
the, that with the combination of the fact
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, if you're used to taking
heroin, that we'd better be strong,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, can't be no messing around.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no messing around, you know,
if you're proper junkie, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and he was always striving for the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he blew himself up making hash
oil, you know, way before he, he was the
[SPEAKER_03]: first Botard, you know, like before there
was even Botard or one of the first in our
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, you know, so I feel like he just
that, that driven force and being kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: coming from that side of the, of the,
of the world is basically making you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus he like, what's interesting too is
like, I met people from everywhere that he
[SPEAKER_03]: had met.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, it just, it was funny how
every time I meet somebody, I can tell he
[SPEAKER_03]: really like, he found the best grower,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: He found the best grower in Seattle,
then he found the best grower in
[SPEAKER_03]: California, then he found the best grower
from wherever, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: He seemed to like have a very good eye for
that or a very good nose for that or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure which senses he do to find
these people, but you know, and luckily
[SPEAKER_03]: now it's a different world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we've, you know, we have,
it's easier to, to find and to meet these
[SPEAKER_03]: people, whether it be online or in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: But back then, like, so I had friends from
Seattle that Neville had come to and
[SPEAKER_03]: traded them for genetics in the late
eighties, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, so then it's like, okay,
well he really went on a mission,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, he wasn't just waiting for
people to bring him material.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the dedication of going out to find it,
and I'm pretty sure he, he filtered
[SPEAKER_03]: everything himself and probably passed all
his tests, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's, and that's compared to like
now, where a lot of people, it's all hype
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, oh, it's, I need to have
that Tahoe cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get that, you know,
going to get the Tahoe cookies because
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody says that's the new hottest
thing, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's totally different than somehow
getting on a plane back in the eighties
[SPEAKER_03]: and going to Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And before there was internet and finding
people who connecting with those people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that was the energy,
the energy put in required, probably
[SPEAKER_03]: created, but the reason why that came out
of it was so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, was that Seattle trip,
do you know, is that the infamous Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: Lights one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's where he got all his Northern
Lights from, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so because a couple of those people
moved to Amsterdam in the early nineties,
[SPEAKER_03]: and part of it was, it was funny was,
okay, so one, the one guy that actually
[SPEAKER_03]: got Neville some material and traded with
him, he got the original silver pearl from
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was Northern, it was a NL early
pearl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he brought those cuts that he had
selected from the seeds he got from
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: He selected cuts, brought that cut to
Amsterdam in 91.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we were selling it through Katsu
as five way because NL Skunk being a three
[SPEAKER_03]: way and early pearl.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way, so we're calling it five way
at the time because it didn't have a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, they bought the collection off
of Neville and it was called silver pearl.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had come up with a name at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, so there was kind of a,
like, and then Neville was shocked that we
[SPEAKER_03]: had this, like, how the hell did you get
the thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he saw our friend and was like,
oh, okay, well that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's one of the few people he
actually gave to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I mean, over the years,
you must've seen a million OGs,
[SPEAKER_01]: a million cookie cuts, you know,
come and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which are the cuttings out of those two
classes specifically which stand out to
[SPEAKER_01]: you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's your OG that's,
you know, the one, the one you smoke if
[SPEAKER_01]: you got the choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I mean, OG or the original
one was, was, I mean, still to this day,
[SPEAKER_03]: the quintessential of OG for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the, after the fact, like the
King's Kush, which was an OG that
[SPEAKER_03]: basically we've renamed to Ricky's
Brothers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush, RBK was like, was Snoop's favorite
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ricky's was Snoop's manager.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I met him in Amsterdam in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when he would come over,
when they would come over on tour,
[SPEAKER_03]: Snoop was always pissed off because there
was never any Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd be like, ah, this weed all sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was like, well, if you told the
manager, if you can get me a cut of
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever he likes, I'll make sure he has
it when he's here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we managed to get a cut off of his
brother, which is funny because him and
[SPEAKER_03]: his brother didn't even get along anymore,
but he somehow managed to get over to his
[SPEAKER_03]: brothers, get a cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I came to Cali, he gave me the cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got it back to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the first time that I,
first time that I had a couple ounces for
[SPEAKER_03]: Snoop, he was like, he couldn't even wrap
his head around the fact that I had the
[SPEAKER_03]: same Kush that he had back in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I figure if Snoop seemed enough Kush
too, so if that was his favorite,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, okay, if that's your favorite,
then I will make sure and I'll make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: to have it for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now it's been renamed Snoop's
Kush and a bunch of different names,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we still call it RBK because we like
the idea of Ricky's brother's Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of, it's kind of Ricky Bobby,
somewhere between a Ricky Bobby.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was literally at one point like we
should just start a whole trailer park
[SPEAKER_03]: seed company and everything will be a
Billy Joe, Bob's cousin's Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jimmy Joe, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's, cause that's kind of where
we're at nowadays where a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: take Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, how many people have taken Kush
and put their own name to it or changed it
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, but to me, the original Kush,
the OGer, which is what I brought back to
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam was really like the picture
perfect one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one, I mean, it's where MK came
from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of where I feel like that's,
that's closest to the source at that
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do you feel about all the
current kind of drama slash, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: ethical questioning going on around the
idea of breeding with other people's
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess specifically, do you feel like
if you've bought a pack of seeds or if
[SPEAKER_01]: you've just obtained them through whatever
means, are you just cool to do whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: you want with them at that point,
more or less?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, yeah, to a point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, here I am the guy that sells the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course, you know, it's, it's a
double edge.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, I'd rather, I'd rather that people
did do that, but then also gave credit
[SPEAKER_03]: because that will help build up the other
person's reputation or as a company.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to people buying two packs
of somebody's gear and then crossing those
[SPEAKER_03]: together and selling those as their own,
that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and to be quite honest,
taking a pack of my seeds and a pack of
[SPEAKER_03]: DNA and crossing those together and
thinking you have a new seed company or is
[SPEAKER_03]: also a little lame, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And a little like, it's not, not really
thinking outside the box.
[SPEAKER_03]: The key, what I've always told everybody
over the years is the way to get respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in this industry quickly is to
bring something to the table, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can always collaborate with
everybody on that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, so for instance, you know,
Sage is what I'm known for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, Oh, I feel like if I bring Sage
into the mix and someone else has
[SPEAKER_03]: something that's special and we take my
male and my Sage or my female,
[SPEAKER_03]: up my Sage and we do a cross, that's,
that's me putting my flavor into the,
[SPEAKER_03]: into the, you know, putting it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I take somebody else's thing as a
breeder, and then I take someone,
[SPEAKER_03]: two different other people's, it's,
I can't really do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it kind of pigeonholes certain people,
but it also, what you notice is the best
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders are guys who like really stick to
their guns.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, for instance, again,
Simon is one of the better breeders out
[SPEAKER_03]: there from Serious Seeds because he has
six varieties, you know, and he's had the
[SPEAKER_03]: same six, he's added like one or two
varieties in the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the most part, he's had the same
varieties for year in and year out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they the same?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, some of them have changed over the
years, but it's very similar to if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding, if you're looking at like
improvements to the strain, if it's an
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement, then we should do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's not, I mean, that's the hard
part too, is we're talking about annuals
[SPEAKER_03]: that we have turned into perennials,
you know, and it's not really like certain
[SPEAKER_03]: plants are not just not pre-red,
you know, they're not designed to last 20
[SPEAKER_03]: years, but somehow we've managed to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over the years though, the best people
or the best breeders are people who
[SPEAKER_03]: realize they have a problem and then
they'll fix it, you know, bring some new
[SPEAKER_03]: blood to the table and add some extra
vigor into their, into whatever they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we take a look at kind of the
offerings from TH seeds, there's quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: few which would be, you know, contestants
to be kind of the poster child,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause they're all, you know, such hits in
their own right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you consider to be, you know,
the one you stand behind the most,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, and, you know, not trying to be
biased.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, still sage, still sage for me,
because of the fact that I always felt
[SPEAKER_03]: that sativas, I mean, you know,
sativa is an overly used word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say narrow leaf drug varieties
are the kind of the adult weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the adult cannabis, as one would
say, but now the sophisticated old school
[SPEAKER_03]: smoker, the guy who actually has some more
experience than just what people have told
[SPEAKER_03]: them and what dispensary they've gone to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are always those sativa based things
that have that like unique cerebral
[SPEAKER_03]: quality to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I feel like things like MK Ultra
are nice, but they're also just,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're just a mirror image of us,
of a Kush with a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_03]: difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's nice, but it's not something
that I feel like I'm standing behind it
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% as my end all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always felt like, like a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure you've had, there's always people
like, well, if you were on a desert island
[SPEAKER_03]: and you had one particular plant,
then for me, it would be sage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like every day type of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a lot of it to do to the fact
that like, you know, sometimes you won't
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just you're on this other tip for a
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you go back to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's literally like, like putting on a
glove or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: This I get that instant vibe where it's
like, well, why the hell haven't I been
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking this the whole time?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't been running around trying to
sell this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just has that long-term sort of
quality, which I, which I think is a rare
[SPEAKER_03]: in a way, because everybody's always
looking for the next best thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I show everyone a question everyone has
to answer on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your favorite chem dog cut?
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, it's the most deep funk,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Chem 91 seems to get a lot of,
everyone seems to love Chem 91 too,
[SPEAKER_03]: but no Chem D definitely.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one, a question I should have probably
asked you a bit earlier when we were
[SPEAKER_01]: discussing some of your stuff,
the Snowbutt, this is a strain that piques
[SPEAKER_01]: my interest because it's so old.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a ton of information about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the backstory on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so I got it from a group in Oregon
that came out to answer them from Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: They brought me Snowbutt, they brought me
the predecessors to the chocolate chunk,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the female side of that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a real unique, like the,
it was more the shape of it was kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot to do with the name behind it because
it didn't have like a peaked bud,
[SPEAKER_03]: like how sours do and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had really like a rounded, almost like
a, there was a plant called Citral back in
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam that was very similar in its
structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it had a very wide top to the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just a real, for me it was a very
like, I don't know, it's hard to say,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the lingering qualities of it was
what I really liked about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it compared to the front end.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was more about the back end on that
thing and super strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was really, we were calling it,
when we first got it, we were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: we were going to rename it Dick in the
Dirt because it was kind of like you just
[SPEAKER_03]: brought to really like, got you really,
really high and really intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so any plans to work with that going
into the future?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, I lost all those genetics
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So actually the funny part was that the
acorn, which we made it from, we made from
[SPEAKER_03]: the snow bud, that we found, we found it
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: My partner found it in Majorca,
was a guy down there who bought seeds from
[SPEAKER_03]: us years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's just been running with that,
particularly like the whole island smoked
[SPEAKER_03]: snow bud, globally smoked acorn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, cause he owns a grow shop
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he basically made all the cuts and
supplied the island with cuts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got that back about a year ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have, but I haven't got it back
because it's in Europe still, but I would
[SPEAKER_03]: love to, yeah, definitely if I can get the
cut back over to the side, it was one of
[SPEAKER_03]: my favorites back in the day for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's a cut that's maybe not
really that widely distributed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you wish it were, you know,
you wish it would appear in more crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: or that the public were more aware of it
because, you know, you just think it's
awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a plant, there's a thing out
here, which I just kind of started to work
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then kind of got off, I don't know
why, actually now that I'm thinking about
[SPEAKER_03]: it, I'm like, maybe I should go back and
get on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just, oh, I know exactly why.
[SPEAKER_03]: More because of the, like it literally
felt like the wind got kind of sucked out
[SPEAKER_03]: of the sails.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first came to Colorado,
I was made aware of a string called tange
[SPEAKER_03]: out of here, the Colorado tange.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like a blackberry flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really deep, kind of somewhere like a
flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you didn't know and you had flow
in that one back to back, you might think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the same plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you grew them out, you'd kind of,
you definitely would see the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was something in the flavor
profile that was very much like flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it had this, yeah, it was just an
intense plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were growing that a lot when I
first came here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was also, I made some crosses with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the problem was that the tange
became so popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just felt like I can't really
promote tange and tange after all the
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: After all these, because it feels like
whenever there's confusion on a string,
[SPEAKER_03]: it doesn't help anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't help either or.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you just get people calling
tange tange and people calling tange tange
[SPEAKER_03]: and mixing it all up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden it's like you're
kind of like taking each other out in the
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not on a quality basis,
but just based on confusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we just kind of, because I
actually had packaging made for tange.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the end, I just like sat on
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I don't see anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only people that are growing it now is
Derek from Incredibles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's who I got the cut from
originally.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like the last guy standing,
it seems like.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that particular plant was one that I
had thought when I first came,
[SPEAKER_03]: had so much potential and I thought that
was going to be the next big thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the end, it didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you have any other lines that
maybe you've done throughout the years,
[SPEAKER_01]: which were really good, but for whatever
reason, they never quite made it to
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, maybe looking back,
you wish they had.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I did like a bunch of Cambodian
crosses and Laotian crosses at one point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone brought me some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem was I really felt like there
was not a big market for those racy land,
[SPEAKER_03]: like those super racy sort of sativas that
didn't grow necessarily pretty plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: like very dark and kind of spotty.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I feel like everybody's more open
to the idea of land races and almost like
[SPEAKER_03]: they'd appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Difficultness, you know, like I actually
had one recently, I was at a show and this
[SPEAKER_03]: one guy came up and it was like the first
time I think I've ever heard anybody say
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this guy came up and he's like,
hey, what is the most difficult thing you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and this guy was like,
oh, well, this one's kind of a difficult
[SPEAKER_03]: plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, usually it's a never.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is usually I want the easiest,
biggest, highest yielding, most THC,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's never, there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this guy was asking for, because in
his mind, it was like the most complicated
[SPEAKER_03]: ones were the most rewarding ones,
which is true, you know, to a point.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also hard if you can't get past
the point of being satisfied at your
[SPEAKER_03]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to change topics up for a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, besides the ADI, which of the
current cups do you feel you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of most happy to throw your
weight behind slash you enjoy going to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think there's only two,
there's only two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's actually three, there's
three that I would do and they're all like
[SPEAKER_03]: coming up right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the golden tarp awards, which is
November 18th.
[SPEAKER_03]: So next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one's actually if I don't know
when you're going to get this posted,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if you're, you should definitely take
a look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe if you get a chance,
if this comes out before and anybody gets
[SPEAKER_03]: a chance to, they're doing a completely
transparent online of the entire process.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a one day thing on the 18th,
but they've got a professional system set
[SPEAKER_03]: up like an NFL camera system where they
have camera set up everywhere with the
[SPEAKER_03]: testing, with the, with the judging,
with the, the award ceremony, everything
[SPEAKER_03]: is based on multiple camera angles and you
can just go for free to your phone and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and like link into them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're taking it to the next level as
far as transparency, but also it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, 250 entries, one winner.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's no other, it's just one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of very similar to our idea
where it's like not, no categories,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just who's got the best weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that, that one's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Emerald cups, obviously the, the,
the sort of crowned I'd say that's,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the best event by far in the world
right now when it comes to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: just cause of the location, location,
location, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're talking about the best of the
best when it comes to growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'll just have to throw some,
I'll just have to give my friend,
[SPEAKER_03]: my friend props because he's, he's taken
it to heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's, he's in the East coast and next week
is also another cup called the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: all-stars and the fact that they are on
the fifth year it's in the tiny little
[SPEAKER_03]: town in Rhode Island and yet they still
have like method man and red man and big,
[SPEAKER_03]: big talent coming through and they it's
the quality of the cannabis is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also the, it like Rhode Island
actually smokes more cannabis per capita
[SPEAKER_03]: than any state in America right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like, and I grew up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, it's always funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm like, well, I thought I was the
only guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize anybody here was smoking
weed, but apparently everybody is smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: weed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting, you know,
you didn't mention any of the high times
[SPEAKER_01]: ones because a lot of the sentiment
expressed these days is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost as if the event comes up more
as though it's trying to be like a music
[SPEAKER_01]: festival as opposed to like a cannabis
event.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, the thing is I've been
involved with the cup since 93.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, it's like, I watched it,
I watched it from a, from a like organizer
[SPEAKER_03]: point of view in the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from a, and then from a punter
sort of view.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then from, you know, and just saw how
it was kind of like the same cycles over
[SPEAKER_03]: and over again, where people got real
excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get involved, they get screwed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They move on next when they can,
they kind of didn't feel like they,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel like they, they, they
nurtured their, their people enough and
[SPEAKER_03]: they kind of went for the, went for the
kill every time on money.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's also like I've watched
them sat down and saturate their market
[SPEAKER_03]: and over, overdo it and do too many cups
in too short a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really burned out a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a lot of people I know, you know,
it's, they don't even bother going to them
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so I feel like high times,
you know, they've done a great job over
[SPEAKER_03]: the years or at least keeping the fire
going.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem was there now it's,
they're turning into what they've been
[SPEAKER_03]: against the whole time, which is the
corporate kind of mentality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and they've kind of moved on to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's enough, it's good though,
because it opens up the, it opens up for a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of these smaller events to,
to shine a little bit when I think there's
[SPEAKER_03]: a, there's a sort of peak point where
events just burn themselves out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it happens with every trade show.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter if it's cannabis or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, there's always going to be a
side project which goes on, which is more
[SPEAKER_03]: real, you know, the real people are
involved because it's, it's a,
[SPEAKER_03]: because they don't want to be involved
with the big corporate minded and it
[SPEAKER_03]: happens in fashion and it happens in
electronics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always going to be another event
that comes around and absorbs the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the energy of that event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, that's kind of where I think
it's at at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, you know, obviously
being the host of a show, I'm sure you get
[SPEAKER_01]: your fair share of criticisms about the
show and the, you know, but email or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot, the same way I do, you know,
the thing I get most notably is like the
[SPEAKER_01]: show's too long and people just get bored
halfway through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which yeah, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see the same thing with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I, my shows turn out to be two to
three hours every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't, but I can't squash enough
into that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a hard time where I'm like,
well, you know, I can't even, I can't
[SPEAKER_03]: even, uh, but you know, but I,
I, I'm like one of those guys where I have
[SPEAKER_03]: a hard time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't have a hard time,
but like, I hate when people criticize the
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, nobody really enjoys that,
but I'm also happy to, to take it to heart
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got guys who say, Adam, I hate to listen
to the done show.
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy can't even get a thought out,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, Oh, I thought I was throwing
out too much stuff, but I guess I'm not,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, you know, and, and it's,
you know, and sometimes there's little
[SPEAKER_03]: things where you're like, Oh, I mean,
I remember the first criticism I heard
[SPEAKER_03]: was, and it was funny because I think
everybody who listens to themselves has
[SPEAKER_03]: their own critique on their own voice or
their, their, their cadence or how they
[SPEAKER_03]: deliver stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the very, very first one was,
I don't know who this, I don't know who
[SPEAKER_03]: the hell this Ray Romano sounding guy is,
but he's annoying.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now I'm sounding like Ray Romano.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, yeah, I kind of get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of see what he's saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, like, I think what you can do
as a, if you're in this kind of an
[SPEAKER_03]: industry and the worst thing you can do is
get onto YouTube and look at your
[SPEAKER_03]: comments, cause you're almost always going
to have the haters in that world.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, you know, you're not
successful unless you have some haters in
[SPEAKER_03]: the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with all that being said though,
you know, the longevity speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What has been in your opinion,
you know, the secret to the longevity
[SPEAKER_01]: overall of both the show and the career,
even, you know, even if there are the
[SPEAKER_01]: haters out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just being authentic and, you know,
and intrude yourself in a sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's kind of the key to,
I feel like that's the key to success now
[SPEAKER_03]: because we're in such a sort of insta
world, you know, everything's instant and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything is not authentic anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really like an authenticity,
lack of authenticity in this world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when something's good, everyone
jumps on that bandwagon, you know what I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like this industry is no,
not any different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're, we're definitely,
you can run around and be a hype guy and
[SPEAKER_03]: jump on everybody else's thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like if you're just true to
yourself and really authentic,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to last a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's funny is I've been totally,
uh, that's been totally confirmed to me
[SPEAKER_03]: recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: I read an article where it was talking
about millennials and because the
[SPEAKER_03]: millennials are, are always, they're
always looking for something that's real
[SPEAKER_03]: now because there's so much fake in the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something we didn't really have
as a, when we were growing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, everything was not that everything
was real, but seems like everything was
real.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a little bit more authentic because
it wasn't like, like now, if you get on
[SPEAKER_03]: the internet, it might take you 10 minutes
to figure out that you're, what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: reading is absolute and utter bullshit and
you might be totally sucked into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but this whole idea of, of putting
layers of bullshit out there wasn't so
[SPEAKER_03]: prevalent before, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Before it was a little bit more like,
yeah, it was hard to get to the,
[SPEAKER_03]: to find the knowledge, but it wasn't
because you had to click.
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't getting clickbait.
[SPEAKER_03]: You weren't getting thrown at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And nowadays it's like the, uh,
the idea of being 24 years, like this is
[SPEAKER_03]: our 25th year coming up now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you're into those ranges,
once you get past 20 years, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like, like any career at that point,
you're like, I guess, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you, you, uh, you either, and the thing is
it's way easier to be authentic than it is
[SPEAKER_03]: to, to try to change all the time because
it's kind of like, you know, trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: like, if you imagine you create your
entire company based on a lie,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you're, you're, you're like,
take for example, saying you started in
[SPEAKER_03]: 1985, you know, how can you, you know,
you can't really, what do you do when you
[SPEAKER_03]: have your 20th anniversary and you're
only, but everyone starts questioning
[SPEAKER_03]: like, well, how could you be 20th
anniversary?
[SPEAKER_03]: You just started four years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, to me, that's like,
it makes it harder as a, as a,
[SPEAKER_03]: to be in the industry longterm,
you know, because you're always now you,
[SPEAKER_03]: now you're, you're always defending
yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I feel like just being
authentic and just sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: real.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and one of the things that's nice is
that, uh, I'm glad I'm where I'm at at the
[SPEAKER_03]: age that I'm at, because I'll be some like
48 right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I think it would be too hard to
become in here as a total new,
[SPEAKER_03]: new guy and try to create an image and in
your own thing, I think it'd be quite
[SPEAKER_03]: hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of glad where I started when I
started because uh, it's not so hard to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to last if you've been around that long,
because it just gets easier in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got that name recognition as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, we're on the, on the tail end
of it all now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This, the last question is a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can, you can go long if you
want, but a little bit more short answer
[SPEAKER_01]: based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so this one actually might require a
little bit of explaining, but I saw you
[SPEAKER_01]: answer a question somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might've been in the Facebook
group, somewhere like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically someone said, how come we
don't see a lot of 100% hemp clothing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you said, oh, it's because it's
actually like quite hard to make a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent versus say like a blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you mind elaborating a bit more
about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people are familiar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, well it's mostly cost restrictive,
you know, like, uh, say you can make a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred percent hemp products and I,
and we've, we've sold them over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the problem was it was always a
combination of cost restrictive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also I don't think people are as
familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, that high of quality material to begin
with, because one of the things that
[SPEAKER_03]: takes, so for instance, linen is a good
example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like linen is not fashionable right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's not because it takes energy to
actually wear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't wash and wear linen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to actually take care of it a
little bit like cast iron skillets,
[SPEAKER_03]: take a cast iron skillet compared to a
Teflon pan.
[SPEAKER_03]: They probably sell a hundred thousand
Teflon pans for every cast iron skillet
[SPEAKER_03]: these days.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're a chef, you're only going to
wear, you're only going to use cast iron
[SPEAKER_03]: skillets because that's what real
cooking's about, but it's also going to
[SPEAKER_03]: last forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it needs to be treated constantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so with, with hemp clothes,
with hemp, when it's a hundred percent,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not going to be wrinkle free.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have to, uh, iron it every
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas when we mix it with cotton,
we can actually get pretty much wrinkle
[SPEAKER_03]: free material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, hardly needs any, any maintenance and
people are more used to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem is if you, if you hand
somebody an item, which you just paid more
[SPEAKER_03]: money for it, and now you have to take
care of it more, that's almost like so
[SPEAKER_03]: against the grain of the modern way of
thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now everybody's, well, if you pay more,
it should just take care of itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, no, actually not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so it's kind of like one of those
things where just people aren't really
[SPEAKER_03]: ready to, to pay the amount that they'd
have to pay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on top of that, learn a whole new
learning curve of how to take care of
[SPEAKER_03]: their clothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, which, you know, it's, it's funny as
a, as a, to be in this industry for so
[SPEAKER_03]: long and then like, I never would have
thought that I would have ever been into
[SPEAKER_03]: fashion and into clothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and the nice part is that because
we're a hemp brand, we're really focused
[SPEAKER_03]: on what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like our materials over the years
have like, now we're doing 70 per 77% hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: on the outer material of our jackets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've actually increased it as much as
we can and keeping it in line with what
[SPEAKER_03]: we've already done.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's your tagline, but I'm just
going to throw it at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to keep it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, if we take a step back though,
what was kind of the inspiration to
[SPEAKER_01]: initially start the clothing brand in
general?
[SPEAKER_01]: It obviously predates a lot of the other
currently popular clothing brands like
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We literally, um, started selling hemp
clothing in 1993 after I quit working for
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was working, when I was working at
Sensei, we used to sell a shirt that was
[SPEAKER_03]: called stoned wear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm probably the people who, some of the
people who listened to this probably had
[SPEAKER_03]: one of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like the original hemp jean shirt,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Long sleeve jean shirt thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and it was like, had really cool patch
and had really cool buttons.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was quite thin.
[SPEAKER_03]: The material, it wasn't really like super
robust, but it was the only hemp product
[SPEAKER_03]: that, that we sold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we sold tons and tons of these
shirts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I started, so then when I
left Sensei, part of the reason I left is
[SPEAKER_03]: cause I was really into the idea of
selling hemp and they didn't really have
[SPEAKER_03]: the inspiration that I was seeing to get
more hemp products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there wasn't really a lot available at
that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then when I, so then I left there and
literally been drunkers, like got me,
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of came, got me over by the doorway
and was like, Hey, you know, good luck
[SPEAKER_03]: with everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, hope you can find that
hemp, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, he had just started hemp
flax at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was about to start growing hemp
because of his frustrations of that there
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't enough hemp around.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, uh, in the beginning I just sold
other people's hemp clothing and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I was getting some pretty wonky
stuff and it was like, I was forcing
[SPEAKER_03]: myself to wear some of the gear just
because I was trying to promote it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I had like overalls that were
too short in the legs and kind of goofy
[SPEAKER_03]: and just weird, weird, weird stuff that I
wasn't really thinking was like
[SPEAKER_03]: fashionable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and then we, um, was working with a
company called THC that had some Italian
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp that was beautiful, like Italian
processed hemp products.
[SPEAKER_03]: That were amazing and they had a hundred
percent, but the problem was again,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the quality was there, everything,
but the prices were just outrageous.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were over a hundred bucks for a pair
of jeans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is back in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like, Oh my God, a hundred
dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, well, this is the way,
you know, a hundred dollars is 200
[SPEAKER_03]: guilders.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like, we're trying to charge 200
guilders for a pair of jeans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people were just like, you know,
couldn't, couldn't get their head around
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we started making our own products
and, but, uh, you know, we, we imported
[SPEAKER_03]: all of the materials from China and the a
hundred percent hemp was always very rough
[SPEAKER_03]: and very burlappy and not conducive to
making good quality clothes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we actually did a, we actually had a
bunch of a hundred percent stuff made and
[SPEAKER_03]: it was like, looked more like the
Flintstones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like as far as just the threads coming
out, the thickness of the thread and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but now we could do a hundred percent
and we might get the price to a point
[SPEAKER_03]: where people might be willing to pay for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, we still feel like the blends
are, are, you know, an easier way to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to get people interested without them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause a lot, the worst thing is to have
somebody buy something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to me, like the most uneco thing
is when you buy some clothing and you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't wear it because when for one reason
or another, like you open up your,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you open up your, your, your closet and
there's a bunch of hemp gear in there that
[SPEAKER_03]: you never wear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're not really helping out
anybody, are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have something that you wear
until it's falling off your body,
[SPEAKER_03]: cause they've wearing it so much,
then that to me is the most eco minded.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even in the beginning, like when people
would be like, yeah, but your dyes not
[SPEAKER_03]: eco.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, we tried that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, we actually worked with some eco dyes
and they, they ruined all the other
[SPEAKER_03]: clothes that people would have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would never want to buy your
clothes again, because they bought that
[SPEAKER_03]: shirt off of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They put it in the laundry with all their
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though you put on the label wash
separately, they don't listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: People, people just don't listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are, people take it, they throw it
in the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They treat it like everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it doesn't work, they'll never do
it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that, that, that to me is a,
the kind of, you know, the, the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the stickling point, a sticking point
between doing a hundred percent hemp and
[SPEAKER_03]: doing a blended blends of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is your preferred grow style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Synthetic or organic and why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm 20% organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, I, I was a victim of every
single over-teched way of growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I first moved to Holland,
it was all about hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in the land of hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to build, I didn't even want to
have soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted, I didn't even want to have
medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to do aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a general hydroponics distributor
between 95 and 97.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, introducing general hydro
to everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was totally all about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was like, and then at a
certain point I remember just like
[SPEAKER_03]: throwing all that shit away and going back
to soil and realizing like, Oh my God,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is so much better for, for just all
around flavors, making seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never make seeds on hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always on soil, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just the mineral contents a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just feel like the connection between
the minerals that you get from the soil
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to what you get from salts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so much different, like just vibe
wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you're making seeds,
you know, you really, there's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's really no formula on the market
that's made for making seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always, you know, you're growing or
you're flowering and that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's different, you know,
pregnant women don't need the same food as
[SPEAKER_03]: non pregnant women, you know, because
their bodies are going through changes and
[SPEAKER_03]: the baby needs something different than
the mother needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same when you're making
seeds, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like when you grow us
organically, there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: completely different shift the way the
plant needs, but it's all available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you just, you give them everything
they need compared to like trying to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and over the years I've thought,
Oh, maybe I should make like a synthetic
[SPEAKER_03]: food for making seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also think some things you can't
fix, you know, or you can't make better
[SPEAKER_03]: than nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ever since doing my show and now more
now no tills come into my world and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: so much more satisfying and the inputs
that go involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also I have like a farm here in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm living in the middle of nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the last thing I want to do is grow
synthetically and not be able to utilize
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'll do is, you know,
use a raised beds for all the old soil and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff and recycle everything properly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's a much better feeling and
I only eat organic food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now and I'm pretty much, you know,
I'm over, I'm over all the idea of,
[SPEAKER_03]: of, of, uh, of synthetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so a bit of an interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your least favorite strain
throughout all of history that you sadly
[SPEAKER_01]: had the pleasure of trying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, you know, to be quite honest,
one of the ones was, uh, so much fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: diesel was because it tastes terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it has like the, it has, and it got
such a big amount of hype in Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the, the, the hot ticket item.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just like, it never delivered,
like it smells really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tastes terrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just doesn't get me high.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was one of those strains that it
just took me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It, it always, it, it just, it,
it was like a huge disappointment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if anybody ever says like,
so they, Oh dude, I got diesel and I'd be
[SPEAKER_03]: like sour.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, so I think that was one of
the ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wouldn't say it's the worst variety,
but it was the least sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the, the one that bummed me out
just every time, like bums me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about your favorite of all time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Favorite of all time is nothing that any
of us have ever grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a tie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a 1985 purple tie.
[SPEAKER_03]: That kind of flooded the East coast for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually met the, one of the main
guys who brought it in at one point where
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, we were talking about, you know,
back in the day and old times and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was explaining and he's like,
Oh, that those are the loads I brought
[SPEAKER_03]: into, into Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Oh, those were amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like this super slow burning
purple tie thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like tiny little buds and just
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, you just don't see, cause you
know, and it probably wasn't from
[SPEAKER_03]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure it was from, it was probably
Laotian or something, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the most part, it was the most
memorable thing that I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lucky last question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could go back to one place in
history and geography to collect Leandre
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, where would you go and from what
time period?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably in the same region, like in Laos,
basically every Vietnam vet out there
[SPEAKER_03]: always has the best weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always been the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it seems like in America,
I was like, wow, this weed is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where'd you get it from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is Vietnam vet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they always, and the thing is that
everybody there would always tell me that
[SPEAKER_03]: the Laotian weed was psychedelic,
you know, I mean, and these are people who
[SPEAKER_03]: took a lot of psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they wouldn't, they wouldn't say it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not understanding it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like that, that, would be
probably some of the more unique things
[SPEAKER_03]: out there because it's such a hard plant
to grow too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like a lot of hermaphrodites,
a lot of issues like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so I think, but it's still,
it would be great to find something out of
[SPEAKER_03]: there that was super electric.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also that Kawaii electric was one of those
ones I wish I could get my hands on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something that I've heard over
the years from friends was just sounds so
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing, but I actually went on a hunt for
it around 2005, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met people who grew it and I met people
who knew the guys who would go to the
[SPEAKER_03]: power lines and collect it and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it, but it never got a chance to
actually try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess we can only hope it pops
its head up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, any shout outs or
comments you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, shout out to the chat gang
out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're listening to, hopefully they're
listening to your show and I will focus to
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure that they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So shout out to Buck Russell and all the
guys who made that, who made the chat gang
[SPEAKER_03]: a real thing, which it's been quite,
it's quite cool to have a dedicated crew
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm sure you got your own,
you must have your own dedicated
[SPEAKER_03]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically shouting you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanking you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, obviously shout out to my
beautiful wife as I end every show and my
[SPEAKER_03]: little kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my, my, my mom and the whole crew to
just hang it in there with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's been a struggle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's one of those things over
the years of doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really, you realize that, you know,
not everybody has the same vision that you
[SPEAKER_03]: have, but if they hang in there with you
and then stay to the end, then they might
[SPEAKER_03]: get to enjoy all the things that we're,
we're trying to make out of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now it's just trying to find our
way with this plant and make it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, benefit everybody in the long
run and not get, not get eaten.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which it, you know, it is, it is in a way,
but at the same time, I feel like there'll
[SPEAKER_03]: always be a piece of it that'll shine
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great sentiment to end the show on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks again so much for coming on the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there we have it guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you did.
