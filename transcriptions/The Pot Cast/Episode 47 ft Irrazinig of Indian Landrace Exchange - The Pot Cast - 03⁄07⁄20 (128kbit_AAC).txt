[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, all right, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And welcome to the one and only,
the land race legend himself, Irazine of
[SPEAKER_00]: Indian Land Race Exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for having me on the
show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really grateful to be here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question we like to ask people first
off, what have you been smoking on
[SPEAKER_00]: recently?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been smoking on some Dosh Valley
resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been cured for a little over three
months, has a really nice zesty citrusy
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're on the front and background is all
really floral.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very nice combination.
[SPEAKER_03]: The effects are really mild.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, it really does not really takes
you out of your working group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get on with your work,
go about doing what you wanna do in the
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the same time, not feel like you
want to indulge in smoking, get
[SPEAKER_03]: interrupted in between your curriculum.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's a great smoke to start the
morning for anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got me interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said it was cured for three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you find as a hash cures,
it affects the flavor and potency?
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely does that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, especially, I mean, if you're
going to talk about the resin that was
[SPEAKER_03]: hand rubbed from the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, we have to understand,
I mean, if that resin is produced in a
[SPEAKER_03]: much different way, then it's going to
have certain properties, which will be
[SPEAKER_03]: very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very different from your conventional hash
that is made by water or is made by dry
[SPEAKER_03]: seeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm gonna just elaborate a little bit
on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens when you're hand rubbing
the plant is that you're also taking out
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the plant matter and a lot of
water content.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your final hash is basically like a
ball of a lot of resin, which is stuck
[SPEAKER_03]: around some impurities like dust and plant
matter, which is binding it together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's binding the lipids together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a lot of water content at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you attempt to smoke something
like that at the same time, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you smell it, it's gonna smell amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The smell's going to be amazing,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you try to smoke it, you will not
feel any flavor at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be very harsh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your nostrils gonna burn like somebody put
chili powder in there and it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: hurt your throat as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because of the water that is
present in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you age it or how you guys say you
cure it, there are a few different things
[SPEAKER_03]: happening there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing that is happening
basically over there is that the
[SPEAKER_03]: decarboxylation of the resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is that the plant matter
that is lost in between that is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: lose the taste that is interfering with
the final flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third and the very important thing
that is happening is that it's losing that
[SPEAKER_03]: water that really needs not to be a part
of the hash because if that hash is then
[SPEAKER_03]: taken to a humid place, it's eventually is
going to develop a rot as it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have mold in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we see in a lot of resin, which is not
aged properly or it's packed in polythene
[SPEAKER_03]: right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't let it sit out for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we see that a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We break up pieces and it's all white from
inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that kind of does the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it becomes very important here to cure,
to age your hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And without that, that hash really is not
worth smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just after a few months, it becomes
something divine from something which is
[SPEAKER_03]: not worth smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great little rundown on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess my little next question on
that is, is there a optimum period in your
[SPEAKER_00]: mind for hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think between three and six months
is the minimum you'd want to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how do you think about it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really sure about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't really thought about it in that
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But within the circumstances that I'm in,
I think three months, three or four months
[SPEAKER_03]: works the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because after that, what we usually see is
that we see, I mean, not through testing,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, through what we feel subjectively
when we smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we see is that it becomes more
sleepy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the high becomes in a way that it
induces more sleepy feeling instead of
[SPEAKER_03]: more energetic feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that I probably think is what's
happening is the THC begins to degrade to
[SPEAKER_03]: CBN at a certain point, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that starts to happen because
eventually after March, it starts to get
[SPEAKER_03]: really hot in India and not everyone has
the capacity to store their hash and seal
[SPEAKER_03]: Ziploc pouches and freezers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by the time it's just, when they take
it out in January, I'm sorry, in October
[SPEAKER_03]: and November, December and January,
it sits in the village or anywhere in
[SPEAKER_03]: India, it's fine because it's still cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after that, after February,
as the heat begins to surge, I think that
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really not ideal for people to store
the hash here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, unless they have a freezer and
they can really just vacuum seal it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in India, because of the diversity and
the dynamics of the season and the way
[SPEAKER_03]: they play out, because winter is very cold
and when it's summer, it's so hot I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: you cannot imagine that there was a winter
in the same country at some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really temperate kind of climate
overall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's three months, four months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's really what does best
in the environment and the circumstances
[SPEAKER_03]: we're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what a fantastic answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question is, what was your
first experience with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: First experience with cannabis is,
I mean, this is going to be vastly
[SPEAKER_03]: different from, because I've heard some of
your podcasts before and people have these
[SPEAKER_03]: really nice stories that my first
experience was I went there and I smoked,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's entirely different for people who
belong to places where it grows
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're just growing up along with this
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you grow up, you just see it
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of is normal until the
society takes hold of you and starts
[SPEAKER_03]: telling you that it might not be a very
good idea if you start smoking this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really helps in actually
propelling a lot of teenagers towards it
[SPEAKER_03]: because then they become curious and then
they really want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really different in India because
it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in our worship.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's part of our food.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use it for the ropes, for a shelter,
for medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even sometimes when the cattle get sick,
we can feed cannabis plants to the cattle
[SPEAKER_03]: and it pretty much seems to do well for
the animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things that I've seen for
myself is if you let those animals lose
[SPEAKER_03]: and if they're having some stomach issues
or some problem, they go and they munch on
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis plants as if they already
know that this is the medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just, I mean, the whole perspective is
different here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so we can't really pinpoint or I
can't really pinpoint, okay, this was the
[SPEAKER_03]: first time that I said, hey, this is
cannabis because it's just part of your
[SPEAKER_03]: daily affair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you don't really realize what was the
first time that you saw people around you
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's, you have people around you
and that just normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really try to pinpoint those
things in the way some other significant
[SPEAKER_03]: things like what was the first time you
got your job or what was the first time
[SPEAKER_03]: you went to a beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those kinds of things could be
pinpointed because they're very specific
[SPEAKER_03]: to your experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is just part of your life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so it's really different growing
around the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to go ahead and tell
really a little story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would, I think, really help a lot
of people understand how things work here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't have a water supply in our
village.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we had to do when we were kids,
we had to grab a pot in the morning and
[SPEAKER_03]: just run down the hill, get the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some spots where water comes out
of the mountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get the water and you can go
about doing your things as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were accompanied with some elder
guys who were around like 25, 27,
[SPEAKER_03]: 19, 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were really kids, seven,
eight, nine years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the time they're descending down
the mountain, they're rubbing the plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: making the hatch as they go down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that once they reach there,
before they take the bath, they can smoke
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they can really freshen up and
start their day as we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were completely unaware of what this
plant is or what is happening,
[SPEAKER_03]: why they're rubbing it and why they really
empty the cigarettes, fill them back up
[SPEAKER_03]: and smoke and get crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this whole thing is big confusion for
us, but we kind of enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would also make us rub those
plants because they think we have these
[SPEAKER_03]: small, supple hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because we were kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a myth in India that,
you know, if kids rub it, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: their hands are soft.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they take out like the best hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't necessarily think that's the case,
but that was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would do that for them and they
would take out the hash from our hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have no idea what they're doing and
why they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like one of the things that I do
remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I really have to pinpoint,
I mean, experience wise, then I would say
[SPEAKER_03]: this was one of those things and it was
happening almost every day because just
[SPEAKER_03]: again, that's part of your being.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as a person and where you live,
your culture, you see everywhere in the
[SPEAKER_03]: temples, you know, on the Mondays,
which was the day of the Shiva,
[SPEAKER_03]: you see a lot of ladies, you know,
just cutting some branches, taking it for
[SPEAKER_03]: the worship.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a whole different world out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, when the, uh, the slightly
older guys would get it off your hands,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you remember how they smoked it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they would empty the cigarettes and,
you know, they would mix it and fill it
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was pretty much getting disgusted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey man, like they, I thought like they're
taking, you know, what do you call,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, an empty body waste kind of thing and
smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of weird and disgusting,
but you know, as, as you grow old and you
[SPEAKER_03]: understand what's really happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not trying to say, you know,
that not some part of our, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever's there on the hand is not
getting mixed with the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It certainly does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but again, I mean, this is,
it is the way it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in India, I mean, so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you remember when you first
like, can remember feeling high,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe from smoking some hash yourself,
for example?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, I started smoking, I mean,
like around 14, 15, 16 years of age.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't exactly, remember like,
you know, uh, you know, what was the first
[SPEAKER_03]: time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's, it just happens eventually
that someday, you know, one of your
[SPEAKER_03]: cousins says, take one puff and then,
you know, the other time you're with some
[SPEAKER_03]: friends and you know, you're also getting
drunk and you take a couple of,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, um, as a whole in Uttarakhand,
you know, the hash, it does not really get
[SPEAKER_03]: you that high, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's not, uh, cultivated or
selected for THC in particularly like some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the other places.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not that potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, the domestication part is not
very, uh, you know, prolific as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really nowhere close to some of
the other regions in India or somewhere
[SPEAKER_03]: else in Asia.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think I was in college when I really
remember getting high and that was,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, some guy who had like come down
from Shimla and he had like one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: best residents he thought at that point in
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I really got high on that
because I was just, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: hanging out with these guys in their
hostel rooms and all of these guys belong
[SPEAKER_03]: to Himachal Pradesh, which was really
close to Punjab where I was in college at
[SPEAKER_03]: that point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm hanging out, I'm smoking,
but mostly it's the cheap stuff that they
[SPEAKER_03]: can share, you know, but every now and
then somebody would come back from the
[SPEAKER_03]: village after the vacation and he will
bring a little bit like two or three
[SPEAKER_03]: joints of really good hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I happened to be lucky to be there,
you know, at that point in time and I
[SPEAKER_03]: smoked it and, you know, the facts were
just nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I ever experienced, I think the
intensity was up to a level which really
[SPEAKER_03]: got me thinking that, you know,
this is, this is an amazing feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, whatever I'm feeling right now,
I mean, this is great state of mind to be
[SPEAKER_03]: in, you know, and it just really kind of
pushed me towards, you know, scouring for
[SPEAKER_03]: more of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, how can I find more people,
you know, who would have something like
[SPEAKER_03]: this, which is not ordinary, but you know,
something better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because now I've gotten to understand,
hey, you know, what these are,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's, there is difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are levels to this hash and there
are like many of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to find, you know,
these people who have the best resin,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are usually the older guys,
you know, 25 and above, because they had
[SPEAKER_03]: really graduated smoking by then for over
seven to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they kind of have found their places
where to get the hash on a regular basis
[SPEAKER_03]: and they usually smoke good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at that point in time, I mean,
we were like 17, 18, 19 year old.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had an entirely different circle,
but every now and then we would get
[SPEAKER_03]: something good, but not regularly at that
point in time for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to go out and, you know,
make friends in other groups and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, meet other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's such an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it just pushes you to socialize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not only that it psychologically
puts you in a state of mind where you feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like socializing more, it also has this
effect that in order to find it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to connect to more people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just amazing how, you know,
this plant has this intrinsic property of
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing people together psychologically,
physically, and every which way you can
[SPEAKER_03]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, kind of raises an interesting
point you just brought up yourself where
[SPEAKER_00]: people in past episodes have spoke about
how, you know, it was kind of a glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you met someone who was a fellow
smoker, it was, you kind of felt like you
[SPEAKER_00]: could trust them a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a similar thing in India?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you meet a group of people and you
say, Oh, Hey, I'm a smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a smoker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you kind of able to make friends
easily or is it, you still got to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: prove yourself a bit?
[SPEAKER_03]: It really depends on you as a person.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what kind of behavior you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in India, I mean, behavior is big.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're, there's a saying in India that
your behavior is your introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you are humble and, you know,
you want to learn and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you do some, you run some errands for the
other guys, you know, then sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they will make you part of your
group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course you can then make friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think that's a very subjective
kind of issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it goes case to case basis,
you know, what kind of really person you
[SPEAKER_03]: are, if you're the kind of person who can
connect to other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people don't really have like a fake I
should say this, a fixed hierarchy or
[SPEAKER_03]: something that you have to have these many
years at a certain level to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke with someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it just really depends on you that,
you know, how curious you are and how
[SPEAKER_03]: resourceful you are in, you know,
getting to these places, getting to these
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once you do get there,
I mean, how good you are in making sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, you're accepted in these
groups and, you know, you can then
[SPEAKER_03]: contribute eventually and become a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's lovely to hear, you know,
if you're kind of of good intention and
[SPEAKER_00]: heart people are accepting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned you first experienced the
nice hash that was brought back by friends
[SPEAKER_00]: after vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that stimulate a curiosity in you to
kind of think I've got to go find a
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent source of this for myself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely it did, but not in terms
of like I have to go out and find the
[SPEAKER_03]: fields pretty much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But more like that, hey, could I find more
people who belong to this place?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because see the way our thinking evolves
is it happens step by step.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there are some people,
you know, who really gifted and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I mean, they would really get to
the conclusion very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for most people, you know,
you go step by step and really when you
[SPEAKER_03]: have such a great experience on something
like hash, the only thing that really
[SPEAKER_03]: comes to your mind is I can I have to find
more people, you know, who has this kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have to be, you know, connecting
with I ought to be connecting with these
[SPEAKER_03]: people so that I can get access to more of
it and see how much, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: more variety and diversities out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, what all experiences are
waiting for me, you know, in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, really, I mean, it didn't really,
I mean, push me in a way that I would go
[SPEAKER_03]: to the fields because that really pushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that push really came later from a
whole different angle, I think,
[SPEAKER_03]: is when I saw someone was growing it in
front of me because there was this friend
[SPEAKER_03]: of mine who was growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is in New Delhi around 2015,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got some seeds from Alana and he grew
in his house and, you know, he was able to
[SPEAKER_03]: make hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that really pushed me and I was like,
OK, I have to now go there and I have to
[SPEAKER_03]: get my own seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had no idea what was waiting for me
once I got there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once I really got there, it blew my
mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I collected my mind all over
again and rearranged it in a way that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, then I was I knew what I had to
do in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pretty much, you know, abandoned my
masters at that point in time that I was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was in the final year of my
masters and I thought, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have to wholeheartedly focus
on this thing and preserving this because
[SPEAKER_03]: there are there were a lot of other things
that I was becoming.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bear off at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I had the same time I connected to
people or Facebook from United States,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of people who are growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I found out that there is a
larger community that exists outside who
[SPEAKER_03]: already know so much about this plant and,
you know, who have done so much work for
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understood that, you know,
I have to play a very important role here
[SPEAKER_03]: by collecting these seeds and making sure
that, you know, before this is lost,
[SPEAKER_03]: we collect as diverse of a seed sample,
you know, make an archive as diverse as we
[SPEAKER_03]: can.
[SPEAKER_03]: That includes pretty much every possible
cannabis variety that we can so that
[SPEAKER_03]: people who are really putting in the work,
the breeders, you know, who are in a
[SPEAKER_03]: position in legal places to do this kind
of work, they can go ahead and they can,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, work with these varieties,
incorporate them into their gene pool and
[SPEAKER_03]: take it further, you know, just like our
contribution to, I mean, because if you
[SPEAKER_03]: like something and you think this thing
helped you in any way, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: shaping your experiences or if you feel
that, you know, this is something you
[SPEAKER_03]: enjoy, then you inherently have a duty
towards promoting that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So immediately my, you know, understanding
shifted and I knew that I have to go to
[SPEAKER_03]: these other places and I have to connect
to more people to, you know, get access to
[SPEAKER_03]: different varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what really, I mean,
pushed me towards going out, but smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: was, I mean, the first step, but it was
not really the ultimate step, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what a really interesting recount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned that you kind of had that
epiphany moment when you went on a trip to
[SPEAKER_00]: Milan or was it, can you tell us about
that trip?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was in Milan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was an amazing, like, like I said,
the moment I got there, I didn't know what
[SPEAKER_03]: was going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just waiting for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going thinking, okay,
now I'm going to the village where I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get the hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll have a lot of options to choose
from and I can have a good time over the
[SPEAKER_03]: week, staying there, sampling all these
different resins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the same time, I was thinking a
little bit about, okay, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there'll be plants as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they couldn't be growing their
plants without the seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the time, I mean, when people
are not really clicking pictures and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not really bringing back pictures
from Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I pretty much didn't have a very good
idea at that point in time that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what I was going to encounter
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get to the Milan and, you know,
we just get down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're not even close to the
village right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about two kilometers away and we can
already see the trails of plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just leading along the way you
can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have all these different
expressions, which are so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have colors, they have variety of
smell from florals, citrus, woody,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, pine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something like pine, like turpentine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was really nice, but that's what we
saw at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We thought, oh, this is it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what they make hash of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, we go a little further
and then we find, wow, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, there are even better plants in
the village.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once we cross the village and we
eventually get to places like Weichen
[SPEAKER_03]: Valley, Magic Valley, and, you know,
Weiling Valley, we really understand,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what is the full potential of
the varieties, you know, these people make
[SPEAKER_03]: hash out of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, I think, was a profound moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it has to rearrange your thinking
in a way, because that was the year after
[SPEAKER_03]: which I started going to these different
places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I went back to my village,
first of all, because I realized that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a lot of hunting has to be done
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of hotspots just like,
you know, Himachal Pradesh has so many.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went back there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a lot of collection out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went near the Tibetan border.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went near the Chinese border that is at
the Manapas.
[SPEAKER_03]: We collected samples.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let me tell you, this is a different
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you cannot go to those places and,
you know, be doing anything around the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis plants, because the moment you
cross into those areas, you're under
[SPEAKER_03]: observation all the time from the towers.
[SPEAKER_03]: People, Indian, Tibetan border police,
is looking at you at all times what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So being a local from that place is really
going to help you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because if you're from outside,
then you can just forget about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can just forget about going to
those places, those border regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then there were other places which
were more relaxed and more tourist like,
[SPEAKER_03]: like Orgam Valley, where you can just
easily act, you know, you have easy access
[SPEAKER_03]: to any tourist, anybody can go there and
collect seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, we went back to Malana
again and we started going to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, started going there at different
phases and not just during the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that really made a lot of other things
apparent to us, which you don't realize in
[SPEAKER_03]: one glimpse or you don't realize even in a
week, if you just go there in October
[SPEAKER_03]: when, you know, things are pretty much
ripening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those things started happening at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it was just all coming
together from that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for us, and, you know, we were just
beginning to understand, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what has to be done and how it has to be
done because, you know, we are in North
[SPEAKER_03]: India.
[SPEAKER_03]: So geographically we're blessed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're close to almost every
cannabis hotspot, you know, within and we
[SPEAKER_03]: can get there in less than 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that really enables us to do all of
these things in a way that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it would be possible for a
lot of other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a powerful little sentiment right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, yeah, you're in such a
valuable position to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wind it back though for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: That initial trip to Malana, when you got
there, what type of variation were you
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing in the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how many different phenotypes were
there and were they really different or
[SPEAKER_00]: still pretty similar for the most part?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you observe?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because I think this is probably
the aspect that was most intriguing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because, of course, you see a
cannabis plant, so you see a few things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see the physical embodiment and you
smell it and, you know, and you look at
[SPEAKER_03]: how beautiful the flowers look or the way
it grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so many other things,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But so I think what was really interesting
to us was the diversity that was present
[SPEAKER_03]: within Malana.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm just going to give you a
little example.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first field that, you know,
I was in Weichen Valley and I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: this field there are about 150 or like 100
plants there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can see a lot of different
phenotypes, a lot of different plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just from a casual look,
I mean, I don't even have to be an expert.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to be a person who has some,
you know, prior understanding of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, how plants work and all of these
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could just be a normal person,
look at it and be astonished and be,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, just be in awe of, you know,
how much variability is present within a
[SPEAKER_03]: very small chunk because they're growing
like tens of millions of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm talking about 100, 150 plants
field as a sample, I'm just talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: a negligible, you know, proportion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the variability was just immense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and it just brings you to a place
psychologically that you are bound to
[SPEAKER_03]: think if this one place has so much
diversity, just imagine what other places
[SPEAKER_03]: which have vastly different environment
like you go to Equator near Kerala or you
[SPEAKER_03]: could go to, you know, Indo-Tibetan border
that is a cold desert.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have to have something,
you know, they have to have something
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to, you know, the plants there
have to grow differently for the reasons
[SPEAKER_03]: that environment and the cultures are
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that really started a
relentless cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, in the terms of variation,
when we talk about in Malana, I think that
[SPEAKER_03]: in itself was one of the things that,
you know, got me thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was possibly the best
thing I ever did that I thought that if
[SPEAKER_03]: this one place has so much diversity,
imagine if I could go to other places and
[SPEAKER_03]: how much more I can get and whether or not
I can, you know, preserve it because at
[SPEAKER_03]: the same time, you know, the destruction
of the habitat is going on for cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: because we don't recognize it as a useful
plant other than the Hindu, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: cultural practice and religious practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the government doesn't see it as
something, you know, which is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's not going to be any
preservation from the government side.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a matter of fact, the government has
been bent on, you know, taking it out,
[SPEAKER_03]: bent on taking it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in Kerala, they have like
completely devastated, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: these places used to have cannabis fields
in and these people that are forced to go
[SPEAKER_03]: back deeper into the jungles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens is they ultimately fall
into the trap of nexolites.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, these nexolites are pretty much
running the show for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they do is they provide them
protection, of course, from the
[SPEAKER_03]: government, the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they also help them take
that stuff, pack it up and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: get to the metro cities like New Delhi,
Bombay, Pune, you know, where you can
[SPEAKER_03]: really get a price for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, I mean, the local farmers
really pretty much getting bent over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he's not getting any money.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're making a lot of money and,
you know, they're using it for their
[SPEAKER_03]: organization because of the activities
they have to carry out with weapons and
[SPEAKER_03]: all of these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the way things are going and the
same things happening in Himachal Pradesh
[SPEAKER_03]: where they're really concerned about their
tourism and they have this feeling that
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis is somehow is going to
destroy their tourism industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just nuts when you think
about it, because most of the people who
[SPEAKER_03]: go to Himachal Pradesh, you know,
they go because of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, well, that's how the government sees
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there is relentless
pressure from all sides, from all sides to
[SPEAKER_03]: just take, I mean, take this thing out of
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we really feel that if
something is not done right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: then it might be a little too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, earlier on, you mentioned that
basically you grew up and it was all
[SPEAKER_00]: around you, but then you just mentioned
that kind of the government's actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more cracking down on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has that been a recent change?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the government's actual stance on
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there any sort of medical program?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there are a few things and a few
ways the government is working.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are places which are of more
interest to government like Himachal
[SPEAKER_03]: Pradesh and places like Kerala have been
in highlight.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, ever since the internet has become
more widespread.
[SPEAKER_03]: So government definitely have their eyes
stuck on these two places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the funds that come,
I think, from the European Union to
[SPEAKER_03]: eradicate the cannabis in India is
directed toward these places.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I talk about Uttarakhand,
the state I belong from, one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Himalayan states, I've not seen much of
the eradication process, except for
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes what they do is they would make
small local government bodies and they
[SPEAKER_03]: would gather people on a Sunday and say,
let's go out and take out all the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis plants that you see around
the roadside.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that pretty much doesn't make,
you know, that doesn't really make the
[SPEAKER_03]: farm population or that the cannabis which
is growing around the road in Uttarakhand
[SPEAKER_03]: is not really the part of the plants which
would go on to then make hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those farms are safe somewhere in the
valleys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the tourism is not that much in
Uttarakhand when you compare it to
[SPEAKER_03]: Himachal Pradesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uttarakhand is more known for pilgrimage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has four of the most holiest sites for
Hindus and for Sikh religion as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people travel there,
but for an entirely different reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: There, tourism has a whole different,
you know, it happens because a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: different region because of the
pilgrimage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you look at Himachal Pradesh or
you look at Kerala, there tourism is based
[SPEAKER_03]: around more like recreation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the things you could do there that you
could not in the other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just quickly, was it before,
sorry, let me re-ask that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of asked that really badly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I'm interested to know when
were you first able to start to link up
[SPEAKER_00]: with other people who were kind of
like-minded?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it before or after the Manila trip,
which really kind of solidified things in
[SPEAKER_00]: your mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was really, I mean,
because before Milan, I was just
[SPEAKER_03]: connecting to, like I said, people more to
acquire like hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could get more of that experience
that I liked at that point in time after
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once I went to Milan, you know,
and I came back and I traveled a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit to other places, like I said,
so then I realized, I mean, I could only
[SPEAKER_03]: go to so many places, you know,
that I have to have other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to, you know, have friends and
people like-minded people in other states
[SPEAKER_03]: because India is a vast country,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's hard to travel, you know,
all across the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought this would be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the end, I mean, that didn't really
work out too well because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of things that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's understandable because if you're
going to involve, you know, if human
[SPEAKER_03]: beings are going to involve in something,
then there is going to be some fuss at
[SPEAKER_03]: some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was not really a big deal,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, after that, I mean, I was
really, you know, inclined towards getting
[SPEAKER_03]: connected with more people, you know,
who are like-minded.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after I realized that, hey,
you know what, this is not going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I cannot trust somebody who's
sitting on internet because I see that is
[SPEAKER_03]: the trend right now that, you know,
you get hold of someone who's on internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say he's in, you know, Africa and
you say, oh, you're in Africa,
[SPEAKER_03]: so you can get me African seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he can get you African seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, if that's how you're going to
go about it, then I think then we're at
[SPEAKER_03]: two different places, you know,
thinking about this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought, you know, I have to go
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other more bigger part was that,
you know, that it had started to generate
[SPEAKER_03]: some sort of revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had a concern that, OK, now I have
this revenue coming in from the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens to this?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I do with this?
[SPEAKER_03]: So eventually you start thinking about it
and you understand that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what do you have to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: All of your answers lies in one thing that
you have to physically go to these places.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to meet these people,
people make them understand, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what your program is all about,
what you're doing and how it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: help them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the other community on the
other side of the world and just make them
[SPEAKER_03]: understand that this is something bigger
than you, me and all of us put together,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and, you know, get them on
board.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time, they get paid for the
seeds that they're giving.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that makes you feel great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know that, you know,
not only that you're helping in
[SPEAKER_03]: preservation, you're also able to mobilize
resources to these people who could never
[SPEAKER_03]: imagine making money of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for them, it's the resin that
makes really the cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm trying to make them understand the
value of the seed and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: value of just about everything in that
plant that, you know, they may be
[SPEAKER_03]: undermining so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really valuable point to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it brings on a range of different
questions I had, such as, do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that money is one of the best things you
can trade people for the seeds or what are
[SPEAKER_00]: some other things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I remember in a previous Bodhi
episode, he mentioned a few different
[SPEAKER_00]: things he likes to trade and they all
sounded really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he'll take some basic medicines
sometimes, or, you know, some coloring in
[SPEAKER_00]: books for the kids and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some things you like to trade?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think just money is the best or?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think money is the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least not for the villages,
you know, which are really located in
[SPEAKER_03]: remote areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for them, even if I get them some
money, I mean, it's more like being on an
[SPEAKER_03]: island with a lot of cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can't really do anything with
it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I feel more appropriate is I
really go there and understand their
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we look around at how could
we make life better for these people,
[SPEAKER_03]: but at the same time not interfere with
the culture enough that it begins to morph
[SPEAKER_03]: into something, you know, like a third
thing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to be very careful about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we do is mobile phones is one of
the most sought after things amongst the
[SPEAKER_03]: villagers, because, you know, they can
hardly get to those places where good
[SPEAKER_03]: mobile phones are available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then battery backups and LED lights,
which are charged by solar energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just a bunch of batteries and,
you know, clothes for the kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, some, you know,
other things that kids would really
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you just could not find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still, I mean, being very careful
that, you know, we don't bring something
[SPEAKER_03]: that might lead to any detrimental change
in their culture or that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: could be the beginning of something which
is not desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I mean, to kind of throw you in the
hot seat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about what greenhouse
seeds does, where they go to these places
[SPEAKER_00]: and trade their crappy European genetics
for the land race seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really have an opinion about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because I think I've seen the,
I've seen the documentary, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that they came in Malara and it was really
nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was shot, you know, very
professionally, but I don't have a very
[SPEAKER_03]: strong opinion about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I will say this.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, you know, they should not be giving
people those seeds, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: because, you know, then I heard an
argument from someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a really stupid argument that
somebody said, hey, you know, these are
[SPEAKER_03]: like feminized seeds and, you know,
it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just begin to understand,
I mean, how short sighted and myopic,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, these people, these people's
visions are, because they're not thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: even if it's a feminized plant,
if it gets pollinated, which it will get
[SPEAKER_03]: pollinated by the males around it and
sudden seeds are going to drop,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't, you can put like an umbrella
under those plants and make sure you
[SPEAKER_03]: collect every seeds and just takes one
seed to fall down, you know, which is like
[SPEAKER_03]: a hybrid, which is hybrid in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not saying that it's going to ruin
everything or, but you have to understand,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we already have a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, we have all the hybrid
varieties we want and we have these places
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's even legal and you could grow
it and it's being sold and being taxed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people are making t-shirts and
trays and I don't know what not,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so let's just, you know,
I think that's enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we don't have to really bring it
to places, you know, where it's really not
[SPEAKER_03]: required.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's just how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm probably going to go down a
wrong path here, but just, just as a one
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated question, cause we're going to
talk about this a lot more later.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever gone to an area,
like a regional area, found a patch and
[SPEAKER_00]: you thought, oh my God, this is all just
like super lemon haze or like something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you go to Himachal Pradesh,
there are certain places, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you could like absolutely tell what's
happening there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Himachal Pradesh is a very interesting
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just, first of all, understand
something about, you know, how people are,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then that would really put a lot of
other things in perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you compare three Himalayan
states, Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Himachal
[SPEAKER_03]: Pradesh, I'm going to say the most
advanced state and the most advanced
[SPEAKER_03]: people are living in Himachal Pradesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you just compare it, I mean,
amongst these three states, not rest of
[SPEAKER_03]: the India.
[SPEAKER_03]: And why that is, well, that's because of
the exposure that they're getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have so much tourism going in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have these, you know, Israeli people
who would almost never go out of Himachal
[SPEAKER_03]: Pradesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even understand, you know,
how they can be there for indefinite
[SPEAKER_03]: periods anyways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have Europeans, you have Americans
and you have, you know, all these other
[SPEAKER_03]: countries like Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, you know, people travel over
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens is that over time,
you know, people get more and more
[SPEAKER_03]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost like those people are
traveling to those countries because the
[SPEAKER_03]: experiences are so frequent, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have been acquainted with the
information that is just not available,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to other places of traditional,
you know, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these people know that there are
varieties that exist, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: which flower faster and can grow,
you know, bigger buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they're very, very potent
as well, you know, which would ultimately,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, get you more money if you were
to make hash from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are people who understand,
but where those people are, they are in
[SPEAKER_03]: Manali.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're around Manali, in old Manali
especially.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a place called Vashisht that's
like famous for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have Nagar.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a place called Nagar that is also
around like old Manali.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these places are like really famous and
you go there and, you know, you could just
[SPEAKER_03]: look at the plant and smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, this is not a plant,
you know, that's been grown here or has
[SPEAKER_03]: been domesticated from the wild
populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just understand that, you know,
this is an effect of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic infection rather.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, there are places, but luckily
places like Kashmir and Uttarakhand have,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, stayed safe from things like
that because, you know, first nobody goes
[SPEAKER_03]: there really.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, even if they do,
I mean, you don't get just enough tourism
[SPEAKER_03]: from other countries that you would
eventually start to have people who can
[SPEAKER_03]: bring seeds over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, you know, we've been going around
those places and, you know, we've never
[SPEAKER_03]: really seen anything, any sign even
remotely close to of something that would
[SPEAKER_03]: suggest that, you know, there's been an
activity like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the follow on question I have
is that, do you think that people trading
[SPEAKER_00]: these modern seeds to land race regions
could ultimately lead to the extinction of
[SPEAKER_00]: those regional cultivars?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, I mean, this is pretty much how
it's going to go down and it's inevitable
[SPEAKER_03]: in a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, no matter how much we,
you know, dislike it or say, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we're going to be warriors and
we're going to stop this, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're all human beings and, you know,
and we're not even like a government
[SPEAKER_03]: funded program or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we understand that eventually when a
lot of people, you know, would become
[SPEAKER_03]: aware that, you know, there is a global
community and, you know, the interaction
[SPEAKER_03]: would have begin to happen in a way like
it happened in the IT sector, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is just absolutely maddening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're going to have tons of people,
you know, selling seeds to India and it
[SPEAKER_03]: only is a matter of time that someone goes
out to all of these places and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, start growing these plants and
start infecting everything and changing
[SPEAKER_03]: them eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what, you know, really our
existence is all about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, as much as I don't like it,
I mean, I'm not going to say that it will
[SPEAKER_03]: not happen because that's just not
practical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there are going to be some places
which will be saved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Places like Lola Valley in Kashmir or
because you just can't go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, like it's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and the only very few people who
can go there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, we know who those people
are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the longest time, I think they will
be able to save their, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: natural varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: But places like Malana and places like,
you know, even Urgun Valley in
[SPEAKER_03]: Uttarakhand, you know, where tourism is
more those places would be the first one
[SPEAKER_03]: to fall prey to things like this because
they're easy to access.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the villagers are very
friendly and well, I mean, that's all you
[SPEAKER_03]: need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they have an inclination
towards making more money from this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just don't see why they would not
want to have those varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would understand that clearly we can
make more money off this and make the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole situation better for us,
harvest early.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you cannot deny the fact,
you know, that there are certain
[SPEAKER_03]: advantages, inherent advantages,
which are attached with these,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, hybrid varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you just have to move to a different
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as soon as they realize that they can
do something better than they would,
[SPEAKER_03]: they would do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess my final question on this
topic is how do you feel about the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that greenhouse seeds, for example,
has never reproduced and sold to the
[SPEAKER_00]: public, these lines, as far as we can
tell, it's just sitting in their seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I don't really think about
those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't really seem to have an opinion
or a, you know, available emotion for that
[SPEAKER_03]: that I can, you know, readily express
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I think about that is,
I don't know, there could be reasons
[SPEAKER_03]: because they did take melano line and,
you know, they made certain varieties with
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, you're right,
they never really released those things in
[SPEAKER_03]: pure form.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you have to understand,
I mean, you have to begin to think at
[SPEAKER_03]: least that these people, I mean,
someone who does not want to include
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone into the club, basically,
you know, is not for the people,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Those people are just trying to do
something which is very specifically
[SPEAKER_03]: beneficial to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, make it appear as
though, you know, other people are part of
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, it's pretty clever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, you know,
it's a business and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not a surprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, human beings have done,
you know, so many things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this just does not even,
you know, this just doesn't stand in a way
[SPEAKER_03]: that it would surprise anyone that,
you know, that has happened, that they've
[SPEAKER_03]: never released any of the pure lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: But well, that's changing because we fear
and, you know, other people are here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many other people from India right now
who are actually on Instagram and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: actually, you know, you know, interacting
with these other folks and getting these
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds out as we speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are folks from India, I know,
and these are all decent collectors.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to do good things as much
as they can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have partnered with, you know,
certain folks in America and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going around doing these
partnerships and, you know, preserving the
[SPEAKER_03]: pure variety and then making some hybrids
with it and, you know, rolling it out to
[SPEAKER_03]: public, you know, collect the funds and
then, you know, distribute it amongst the
[SPEAKER_03]: grower and, you know, the collector and
the other people, the farmers who are
[SPEAKER_03]: involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just saying, seeing these so many,
you know, multitudes of facets,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in which people are discovering,
you know, how the preservation of the
[SPEAKER_03]: landrace and heirlooms could become more
prevalent and could become a thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually, that, you know, if you are a
person of cannabis and you don't grow a
[SPEAKER_03]: landrace and heirloom variety,
if you haven't preserved one, then it
[SPEAKER_03]: should be like, you know, shame on you,
something like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that you seem to say that, you know,
you derive a spiritual pleasure from this
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, right, but at the same time,
you haven't done anything to preserve the
[SPEAKER_03]: source from where you derive that
pleasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once people have that kind of
understanding, once we understand on the
[SPEAKER_03]: spiritual level why the history matters,
why we cannot ignore these people who have
[SPEAKER_03]: done all the work for thousands of years,
who have gone out in the wild,
[SPEAKER_03]: recognized the plant, brought them back,
domesticated them and got them to a point
[SPEAKER_03]: where they started to look like the
cannabis plant that we, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some people from Europe or
America, you know, they went out and they
[SPEAKER_03]: grabbed those varieties and, you know,
made hybrids within a matter of few
[SPEAKER_03]: decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that was only possible because
before that, those varieties were,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, domesticated for thousands of
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just say this very bluntly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if those people had to go out to
places where, and, you know, get the
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties which are absolutely wild,
you know, they grow like just really weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: you understand why it's called weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you had to work with them,
a lot of people would still be breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: them and getting them to a point,
you know, where they have some sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: consistency, some sort of homogeneity in
terms of their traits that they like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really when, you know,
so it would have taken a lot of time and
[SPEAKER_03]: we wouldn't be nowhere near where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a big part of that is to understand
that, you know, the domestication part,
[SPEAKER_03]: the foundation work was done by the
people, you know, who are these indigenous
[SPEAKER_03]: communities in Himalayas, in Afghanistan,
in Pakistan, you know, Africa,
[SPEAKER_03]: in Laos, Cambodia, Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I don't want to just like list
all of these, but you know, all of these
[SPEAKER_03]: places.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to recognize them in an organic
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not a political way of seeing it
that, hey, you know, these guys deserve
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you're going to say that,
you know, that I get a spiritual
[SPEAKER_03]: experience from cannabis, then let me ask
you something, you know, what is the
[SPEAKER_03]: essence of spirituality?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it lies in the deeper subjective
understanding, you know, of our own self,
[SPEAKER_03]: of our things that are around us that
makes us happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is one of the things that I can
think of that makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it has a deep impact on me
for that reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how can you like completely or truly,
I mean, reconcile that spiritual
[SPEAKER_03]: experience without actually knowing or
understanding or even appreciating the
[SPEAKER_03]: magnitude of work which indigenous
communities have put in these thousands of
[SPEAKER_03]: years before we came into the picture?
[SPEAKER_03]: So once those things become, you know,
common knowledge and we know all of that
[SPEAKER_03]: history, the cultures, that's when we can
truly say that we are able to now have a
[SPEAKER_03]: complete spiritual experience from this
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, really powerful sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we just jump back in the story,
I just wanted to quickly ask another
[SPEAKER_00]: question about the Malana fields you went
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they making charis or hash from those
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, what was it like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, so they don't actually like
stand in the fields and rub them.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they usually do is either they send
the women of the house or like somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: would go out, venture into the fields with
like a makeshift basket which is attached
[SPEAKER_03]: to a rope and you could wear it like a
bag, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would, you know, cut a bunch of
plants and they would just bring them to a
[SPEAKER_03]: designated place of rubbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me just tell you a little about,
you know, the rubbing here so that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it becomes a bit more
understandable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one is Malana village and most of the
rubbing does not actually happen over
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the hash is not actually made in
the Malana village because their fields
[SPEAKER_03]: are around the village, which are these
different valleys, Wai Chin Valley,
[SPEAKER_03]: Wailing and Magic Valley and a few others.
[SPEAKER_03]: What these people do is that these people
have makeshift houses in each of these
[SPEAKER_03]: valleys where their fields are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not traveling back and forth
every day to their house during the
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest season because the harvest window
is small and the same time police is
[SPEAKER_03]: cracking down on them and they have to
make sure that they go get through their,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, whatever they've grown,
they're produced very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the best way to do it is during the
Octobers, they would move with the entire
[SPEAKER_03]: family to these places like Wai,
let's just say in Wailing Valley,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And now from that point onwards,
every day is simply dedicated from morning
[SPEAKER_03]: till they go to the sleep, rubbing hash,
producing hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a relentless process.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're speaking to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could be there smoking or
eating food or looking around and you
[SPEAKER_03]: would just see these people are going
about it as if like we go about breathing
[SPEAKER_03]: around that point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it gets normalized pretty soon once,
you know, you grow accustomed to it
[SPEAKER_03]: because you see so much of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, soon as you get in there,
if you go there, you know, the season
[SPEAKER_03]: when, you know, plants are flowering,
that is around October, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: October and November as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But November, you don't see much of
rubbing, but October, it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you just get near Malana and,
you know, the air has this freaking smell
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it drives you crazy and it tells
you, you know, where to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just leave the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I actually saw on one of your
Instagram posts that you were saying a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the kind of hash and charis and whatnot
that comes out of that region is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a 50-50 of THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that's, that's really
surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like, what do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you make?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you think that really happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't think many people would have
predicted that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I'm going to tell you like,
why I think that is the case and like how
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to that conclusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was somebody in Europe who
imported by, you know, however he managed
[SPEAKER_03]: it to import some hash, which was from
Malana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was tested and it came out to be
like 50% THC and almost like nearly 50%
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have to understand that if hash is
coming from Malana, it's not coming from
[SPEAKER_03]: one plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you have there is you have a small
chunk taken out of a huge chunk that was
[SPEAKER_03]: made from so many different plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you were to do like a random
sample, like you would do in an
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment, that's exactly how it would be
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would just go about without
discriminating amongst the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just say the first 50 plant that I
encountered you know, I'm going to disrupt
[SPEAKER_03]: them and whatever the hash tells me is
going to be the story is going to be the
[SPEAKER_03]: phytochemical story of this population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when that happened, what we saw was you
see, you actually see a higher amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD by the way, but it's still,
I mean, almost equal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 60, 40 kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was another incident.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this was one incident.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second isolated incident was I gave
some seeds to one of the guys who grew it
[SPEAKER_03]: and he grew actually a few of them,
not just one or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this guy did something really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did not seed them and you know,
he trimmed them and cured the buds and he
[SPEAKER_03]: smoked everything separately and he had
marked the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he came back to me and he said,
he said, look, it's weird, but here's the
[SPEAKER_03]: deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the plants, you know, have a great
high and then these and some plant have
[SPEAKER_03]: mild high and there are some plants which
have no high at all, no effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like this, they have all the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have all the beautiful smells just
like the other plants, but they just don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have any effects to them at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that gets you thinking that what is
happening there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically what you're seeing is you're
seeing resin on the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there has to be some, something,
some cannabinoid in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's not THC, then what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the only more abundant cannabinoid
that, you know, actually is present in the
[SPEAKER_03]: environment is CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had already known from that test
that came from Europe for that hash that
[SPEAKER_03]: was imported from India, that a major part
of the, you know, the chemical composition
[SPEAKER_03]: is CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you just put these observation
together and, you know, think in a,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in a reductive manner,
then you ultimately get to a conclusion
[SPEAKER_03]: that look, there seemed to be this
distribution of population in a way that
[SPEAKER_03]: there are plants which are purely,
you know, making CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that said, they have certain
amounts of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to say that it's zero THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some THC with predominantly CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have plants which have a very
nice balanced CBD and THC content,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is close to 50-50 or, you know,
just various combinations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have plants which are
dominantly producing THC and they're,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they produce very little CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you see in nature is, I mean,
Milana, that you seem to have these three
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties and they're intermixed,
they're getting cross-pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the population or the dominance of the
population, you know, it works out in a
[SPEAKER_03]: random fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you see is the dominant genotype,
sorry, the chemotype is the one that
[SPEAKER_03]: produces CBD and THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually fell back to one of the
studies that happened in 2003.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was from America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody did an experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: He took a drug variety and he took a
non-drug variety, which is a hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: He crossed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what he saw in F1 was, you know,
from the heterogeneous population,
[SPEAKER_03]: he saw that most of the plants carried a
co-dominant expression, which was THC and
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And about like 25% of the plants,
close to 25% of the plants were CBD and
[SPEAKER_03]: close to 25% were THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was almost like a one ratio,
two ratio, one in F1.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that tells you something that if these
populations are led to mix and
[SPEAKER_03]: intermingle, then which chemotype would
eventually be more dominant and which
[SPEAKER_03]: would be a little more recessive in
nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's exactly, you know, what we're
seeing in Milana when we isolate these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants and, you know, grow them separately
and, you know, take out the resin
[SPEAKER_03]: separately and sample them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that is just not a thing that's
gonna happen in Milana.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can't get people to just rub
one single plant and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: give you the hash and then rub different
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although we are going to try to make that
happen this year, we're hoping that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna make this, you know, happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's gonna be difficult because it's
hard to find, you know, plants big enough
[SPEAKER_03]: that you could just rub and make a
tangible amount of resin to sample for
[SPEAKER_03]: five to six people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see if we can work it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I can get some of the samples out
for testing as well and I can have the
[SPEAKER_03]: testing done from one single source to
really get a comprehensive report,
[SPEAKER_03]: which can be, you know, taken a little
more seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a cool little goal for this
next coming year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the question that comes to mind
for me is why do you think we see this
[SPEAKER_00]: strong occurrence of CBD in this type of
hash compared to say Afghani hash where we
[SPEAKER_00]: just see it's primarily THC?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the answer lies in the way
human beings have, you know, interacted
[SPEAKER_03]: with the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: A big part of that is the way they have
been domesticated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we just rewind a little bit and
let's just start from a time when human
[SPEAKER_03]: beings are not really aware that,
you know, cannabis is something that they
[SPEAKER_03]: need as a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has so many, you know, beneficial
properties and such a wonderful thing to
[SPEAKER_03]: be around.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, just give me one moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once that happens, once a community,
let's say, let's take an example of
[SPEAKER_03]: Hindukush.
[SPEAKER_03]: A community in Hindukush realizes that,
hey, this is a great plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is growing around us and,
you know, it has certain properties and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they do is they take that plant
and they bring it to their surroundings
[SPEAKER_03]: where they grow other useful plants like
tomatoes or, you know, coriander or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything else that they grow over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would start cultivating it along
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So eventually what's going to happen is
some physiological changes would be
[SPEAKER_03]: observed over time because of,
you know, the frequency of the nutrient,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, increasing and, you know,
the plant would eventually accommodate to
[SPEAKER_03]: those changes and become vigorous,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It would increase the surface area of the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: The stem is going to become more rigid
instead of the spindly one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would, of course, produce more
because of all those changes present in
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the domestication that happened in
Hindukush basically, that happened around
[SPEAKER_03]: the recreation part because I don't think
in Hindukush they were making ropes out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they were domesticating
those plants so they could, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: take out seeds and make chutney out of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think those things were happening
over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I really think was happening there
was that they had realized that this plant
[SPEAKER_03]: has an amazing capacity to produce
substances which are just amazing,
[SPEAKER_03]: like it could take you into a different
realm altogether.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, for someone who's more
religious, he could associate it in a way
[SPEAKER_03]: that, hey, this could be spiritual,
you know, and it brings me closer to God.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for those reasons, I think most of the
domestication that happened in Hindukush,
[SPEAKER_03]: that happened around the recreation part,
they were more inclined towards
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivating the plants which had a more
significant effect on our cognition rather
[SPEAKER_03]: than selecting plant which looked to be
more beneficial or had like more stem to
[SPEAKER_03]: it or, you know, larger leaves or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you come to like, you know,
Southeast Asia or Central Asia,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Central Asia is in the North Indian part
of Central Asia.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening there is, first of all,
you look at the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant has a different, you know,
morphological structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does it differ from the Afghani
variety?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the way it differs is it's much
taller and it flowers for a little longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you look at the leaves,
you know, closely at a domesticated
[SPEAKER_03]: variety, let's say from, you know,
Malana, what you see is the leaves are not
[SPEAKER_03]: narrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are actually pretty broad.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are actually pretty broad leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that the plant grows in a way
that when you look at the overall plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: you cannot say that it's a broad leaf
variety because it does not have the other
[SPEAKER_03]: characteristics which would correspond to
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically, I mean, the same thing is
happening in Malana.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what is the difference?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the difference is that in Malana or
in India or Southeast Asia, people are
[SPEAKER_03]: selecting for various traits and not just
for recreation.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're selecting the plants because they
want to make ropes out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're selecting those plants because
they want to be able to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: use that fiber or those, you know,
thick stems for a shelter or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So those changes ultimately led to the way
those plants are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they have like a hemp-like
structure and basically they are not as
[SPEAKER_03]: potent, not nearly as potent as any of the
Afghani varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the biggest difference that,
I mean, the difference between,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, having a variety which is very
potent and not very potent is the way they
[SPEAKER_03]: were domesticated by human beings and what
they domesticated them for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's what the embodiment of the
plant show with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, a lot of feature has to do a
lot with the environment as well,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think we'll get to that later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just for the domestication part and
from the part that you said, why a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: variety seemed to have, you know,
a much more intense effect than the other
[SPEAKER_03]: one, then I think that really is the
answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: The answer lies in the way they have been
domesticated from the earliest time and
[SPEAKER_03]: the people and the communities which have
engaged with those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a fantastic answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes me think then, do you think
that maybe the selection for a bit more of
[SPEAKER_00]: those hemp traits, like what we mentioned
in the South East Asian region,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think that how they did select for
those other traits such as the fiberous
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics and whatnot added to why
these plants perceived as having a more
[SPEAKER_00]: uplifting high?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think the uplifting versus
sedating component was almost independent
[SPEAKER_00]: of that type of selection?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they have not really selected for
the effects very specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that could be something which is
just innate to the plant that a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: type of plant, I think it could have
something to do with the environment
[SPEAKER_03]: because what you usually see, and I don't
necessarily subscribe to the idea that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the narrow leaf varieties would
always have or necessarily have an
[SPEAKER_03]: uplifting high and Afghani variety or a
short, you know, short flowering variety
[SPEAKER_03]: would always have sedating effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's not that black and white,
first of all.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, even to a large part,
if you feel, I mean, that is the case
[SPEAKER_03]: which we see to a large extent it is,
then I think that is that's by the product
[SPEAKER_03]: of more like the environment that they
grow in, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't really understand,
I'm not trying to say that I do understand
[SPEAKER_03]: that, but I would lean more towards the
environmental factors which may have
[SPEAKER_03]: contributing in the way the plant makes
you feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll give you one example,
I mean, that might make you understand
[SPEAKER_03]: that why I'm leaning towards more
environmental factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the quality of the resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you go to a region, you know,
that has a very dry climate and the rain
[SPEAKER_03]: is very scarce, it's very arid and cold,
what you see is the trichomes have a very
[SPEAKER_03]: dry texture on the outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're not very sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you really have to, you know,
I mean, you really have to touch them to
[SPEAKER_03]: break them apart, you know, and you can't
just touch them and expect that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like a jelly, like it's life
like, you know, thing would happen as you
[SPEAKER_03]: touch the resin because it's just not
sticky.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the other hand, when you go to
places which are like, which have a
[SPEAKER_03]: subtropical or a tropical environment
where rain is prevalent and it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: wet during the flowering, what do you see?
[SPEAKER_03]: What you see is that the resin has a very
gluey, sticky texture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it makes perfect sense,
you know, because in a situation where
[SPEAKER_03]: it's constantly raining while your plant
is in flowering, what you would want is
[SPEAKER_03]: your plant to have a very sticky kind of
resin so that the water does not hold on
[SPEAKER_03]: in between them and it just, you know,
slides right through the buds because that
[SPEAKER_03]: is really going to help you mitigate those
environmental risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, apart from that, there are
certain, you know, innate qualities in
[SPEAKER_03]: plants which make them, of course,
resistant to things like mold and mildew
[SPEAKER_03]: and all these factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the apparent physical traits,
some of the apparent physical traits are
[SPEAKER_03]: also there, which you can see as the
adaptations in the plants because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: environment they grow in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're talking about the texture of
the resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're talking about the thing that
actually induces the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the psychological changes when you smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the texture of that thing is
dictated pretty much by the environment to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow in, then it's only reasonable to
believe that you could take it a step
[SPEAKER_03]: further and, you know, it probably
transcends into, you know, the effects as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but again, I'm not going to say that
that's the case or I understand that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's what I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it perfectly segues into my next
question, which is that we often hear this
[SPEAKER_00]: idea expressed about, let's just say
you're in some region and you smoke some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the herb and it's brilliant and you're
able to get some of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would often say that if you take
that back to where you come from,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's assume you're from a different
country, you go back to where you're from.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow it out, say indoors or just
under some quite controlled conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just not going to be the same,
you know, because it was all about the
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir and the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I get some really nice bud from
India, am I never going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduce it even with the seeds in
Australia, for example?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what's contributing to that sort
of thinking is a few different factors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to like lay it out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the first and the foremost thing
is that we have to understand if you're in
[SPEAKER_03]: a place like India where it grows
naturally, let's take an example of Malana
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's a known place, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're in a place and you find a
plant, oh, this is a great plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I would love to grow this plant
when I go back home to US or Australia,
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever, and you take out seeds,
but you don't know which males went on to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, pollinate that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apart from that, what you're looking
at is not a true breeding variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not true breeding in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that means they are not homozygous for
all the traits you're seeing in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the reasons why you see
so much variability in the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when you look at a hundred plants
and like there are like 35 different kinds
[SPEAKER_03]: in a hundred plants, then you understand,
I mean, there's a lot of variability in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of genotype, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it becomes really hard to find that
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the things because it's not
being, you know, bred by someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not being narrowed down or
bottlenecked.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just emerge as like one-off plant
that you may encounter and may like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the second thing is the question that
you asked that, is it all about the
[SPEAKER_03]: terroir?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it going to be the same?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, of course, terroir plays a pivotal
role in the way your plant is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: look.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, if your grow room is too hot,
I mean, you know, your plant is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: look like shit pretty much, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have a, if you have a colder
environment in your room, which is around
[SPEAKER_03]: 22, 24 to 20 degrees Celsius, then you
know, your plant's going to pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: have a very good time, even if there are
some other deficits.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant would still do much better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we understand that even in real time,
I mean, you know, the plant reacts to the
[SPEAKER_03]: environment it's in and it's trying to
mitigate those things by, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: expressing itself in a way that it could
just get through this somehow and produce
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers and make seeds because at the end,
we have to understand the plant is not
[SPEAKER_03]: working for us, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant is working for itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wants to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wants to reproduce and that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now it's up to us, you know,
that we have to save it from the mail and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you know, make it seem familiar
or like whatever we want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, we have to understand that the
environment, while it's having an impact
[SPEAKER_03]: on the plant, it's not so deep that it
would change the characteristic in a way
[SPEAKER_03]: that you'll not be able to recognize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to give you an example for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say that you went to Kerala and
you collected some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we all understand these are equatorial
varieties and, you know, they flower for a
[SPEAKER_03]: very long time, around 16 to 18 or even 20
weeks sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rare, but they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so you bring that back and you
grow inside your house.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you may see is that you might just
see that you have slightly broader leaves
[SPEAKER_03]: because your indoor grow room or your
outside condition may be a little colder,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might see that, but you're not
going to see that a Kerala plant is going
[SPEAKER_03]: to finish in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a change of that magnitude would
never happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other thing is that are you
able to find the very specific bud or the
[SPEAKER_03]: flower or the flavor that you were looking
at?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now in terms of flavor, you can get lucky
because flavors, even in, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: even in the population, which have great
variability, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the flavor seems to be pretty homogeneous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know for what reason, but it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, you can have, you know,
you can find the flavor within a
[SPEAKER_03]: relatively small population.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you really want to find the same
plant, there is no guarantee.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if somebody's like offering you seed
by saying that, I mean, well, then you
[SPEAKER_03]: should be very skeptical of that person as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can definitely agree with that
sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to ask a little bit because I
mean, I'm the first one to admit I could
[SPEAKER_00]: probably be a bit more educated about
this, but what's your take on
[SPEAKER_00]: classifications?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that you're not
particularly into the whole Sativa Indica
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause as you said, it's just not so clear
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you try to classify plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a little follow-up, how would you
describe most Indian varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that they're more kind of
uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you describe them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, before I really get down to the
classification part, first of all,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to speak briefly about,
you know, what exactly is the problem with
[SPEAKER_03]: the current nomenclature that,
you know, you seem to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Indica Sativa thing, I mean,
now I'm hearing a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they're trying to say that,
hey, you know, this Indica Sativa thing
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't seem to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the distinction is not,
you know, great enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there are a lot of plants in
between.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't really know what to call
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people are, you know, the more they get
exposed to different varieties,
[SPEAKER_03]: more they would understand that how these,
you know, labels are just not going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: enough to encapsulate the whole idea of
this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, where it particularly fails is I
think in the settings that where people
[SPEAKER_03]: have not been who are using these words.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just say somebody and I'm just
giving an example, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's just say, for example,
in someone in America says today,
[SPEAKER_03]: says one day, I'm going to call all the
cannabis plants with narrow leaf Sativa
[SPEAKER_03]: and everything that grows with broad leaf
and stay short, you know, subsequently,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to call it Indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, OK, that's perfect,
because that's all I see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see narrow leaf plants and I see broad
leaf plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's really his world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I mean, it's not other people's
really fault that you have never gone out
[SPEAKER_03]: of your house or you've never gone out of
your country, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've never seen that, you know,
there's more exist in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from that person's perspective,
it's perfectly OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the system seemed to work
OK up to a point where other people start
[SPEAKER_03]: to come in and, you know, they start
sending in all these varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you see is you see narrow leaf
plant that finish faster, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what you would expect from an
Indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have, you know, a really
broad leaf plant that would go on to
[SPEAKER_03]: flower like 13 to 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when you begin to think that,
hey, is it really, I mean, is it really
[SPEAKER_03]: sufficient, the Sativa Indica label,
to, you know, capture the whole idea?
[SPEAKER_03]: And clearly, the answer is no,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at the best, it creates confusion
and nothing else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, another problem with that kind of
labeling is that when you go to,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you an example of Kashmir.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to Pulwama, so what you're going
to see is there are farm population which
[SPEAKER_03]: are being farmed by the farmers,
right, domesticated ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just on the vicinity, what you're
going to see is there are a lot of wild
[SPEAKER_03]: population, untamed population,
which is just growing like wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody is stopping those two varieties
from interacting with each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you see a third variety is
stemming from that interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an intermediate variety between
those two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you account for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's hard, it's hard to account
for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that label sort of like fails us in
like so many ways, you know, that I just
[SPEAKER_03]: don't feel comfortable using it because I
often get to points where I just feel that
[SPEAKER_03]: this is not enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I did as a solution, because you
just can't complain about it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do something about it if you
don't like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I did was I thought, you know,
this, I think, I may be wrong,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think Robert Clark was the person
who proposed that, you know, these should
[SPEAKER_03]: be labeled as broadleaf and shortleaf
plants, I'm sorry, narrowleaf plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find that, you know, much better because
first of all, those words are
[SPEAKER_03]: self-explanatory.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to tell someone what a
narrowleaf drug variety is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just explains itself in itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want it to be simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the second thing that it does is that,
you know, it effectively classifies those
[SPEAKER_03]: two plants that we are referring to a
narrowleaf drug producing variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you could have varieties which
are narrowleaf and non-drug producing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it also accounts for those varieties,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, you run into a small
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that small problem is when you
encounter varieties like, let's say from
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern Kashmir, which are narrowleaf,
but they flower very fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: They in fact flower within 55 to 66 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it seems like that there has to be a
little more to that broadleaf narrowleaf
[SPEAKER_03]: section if you could.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there is a very good answer to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I thought was you could basically
look at these plants and I'm not talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about hybrids here, okay, because those
are like man-made, you know, combinations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're just talking about the naturally
occurring varieties and the varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: which were derived lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we can do is we can distribute the
word in basically four to five different
[SPEAKER_03]: zones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So initially I did four zones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I did was I thought, okay,
so I'm going to start from the equator.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do I have is the thinnest leaves
like needle-like leaves in the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: which are growing near the equator,
but they're also not at high altitudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can be like, you know,
like Colombia, you know, where you have
[SPEAKER_03]: highlands, even though it's pretty close
to the equator, not that close.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's around 26 degrees naught,
but still.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but they are highlands, so it's going
to affect the plant in a different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought, okay, pure first category is
going to be the purely narrowleaf plants
[SPEAKER_03]: which grow in the equator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I call them equatorial long flowering
varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now what this does is first of all,
it tells you about where that variety is
[SPEAKER_03]: coming from, equatorial.
[SPEAKER_03]: You immediately know this is an equatorial
variety, comes from equator.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second thing you immediately
understand, it's a long flowering variety,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So an equatorial long flowering variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now this is where I say that you go around
the equator, anywhere in the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: and if you find a plant that is naturally
growing or being domesticated around the
[SPEAKER_03]: equator, it's going to have a very long
flowering period around like 14 to 16
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks, which is quintessential to the
cannabis varieties which have adapted
[SPEAKER_03]: around those regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to have narrowleafs because
it's going to be hot and the plant would,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the way plant tend to mitigate
that is by, you know, reducing the surface
[SPEAKER_03]: area of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we move on to the second section.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second classification was highland
long flowering zones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now if you come to places like
Colombia, like I spoke about Colombia,
[SPEAKER_03]: or I would actually like to talk about
Himachal Pradesh, or Malana, because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: around the same latitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's around like 29, 30 degrees north,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, these places are not very close
to the equator, but they're not very far
[SPEAKER_03]: away from the equator either.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, there is a very
interesting characteristic attached to the
[SPEAKER_03]: second category.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is that these are highlands.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the places which have altitude
over 1,500 meters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything at any region that is building
below 33 degrees north, and I will come
[SPEAKER_03]: back to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why 33 degrees north?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll come back to it later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any place that is 33 degrees, which is
below 33 degrees north or south of the
[SPEAKER_03]: equator, and it has an altitude of 1,500
meters or above, that would be classified
[SPEAKER_03]: as a highland long flowering variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you go to these places,
what you see is you see a medium long
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering varieties that flowers just a
tad bit earlier than, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the equatorial ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your Kerala finishes around 16,
and your Malana is going to be done around
[SPEAKER_03]: like 12, 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there'll be about a month difference,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we move on to the third category,
and this is where, you know, things will
[SPEAKER_03]: get really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the third category is the areas which
are high latitude short flowering zones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the word tells you that these all
areas are situated in high latitudes,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the plants that grow there are short
flowering in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about places which are 33
degrees north or above them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They seem to have a characteristic that
those varieties will finish faster,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they always tend to have bigger resin
glands and like more copious coverage of
[SPEAKER_03]: resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, again, makes you believe,
makes you think or believe that the colder
[SPEAKER_03]: environment has a direct relationship
with, you know, the resin coverage of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last one is high latitude
highlands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are some highlands within the
high latitude because the third category
[SPEAKER_03]: that we spoke about, high latitude short
flowering zone, that was for all the
[SPEAKER_03]: places which are below 1,500 meters in
altitude but above 33 degrees north.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they still have a significant short
season, and the varieties tend to finish
[SPEAKER_03]: around like eight to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, or around like 10 weeks, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you go to a different region,
you know, which is highland, but it's
[SPEAKER_03]: again situated above 33 degrees north.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now things really get interesting here
because not only those places are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be cold, you know that those places are
going to get the snowfall right around the
[SPEAKER_03]: end of November, around the end of October
or the beginning of November.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, one, they are so higher up in
latitude, I mean, they're above 33 degrees
[SPEAKER_03]: of north.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, there is 1,500 meters of
altitude or more involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: So places like Hindukosh, you know,
Hindukosh Mountains or certain places in
[SPEAKER_03]: Pakistan like Chitral or Abbottabad,
all these places are like above 33 degrees
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, they also have an altitude
of 1,500 meters and more, and they seem to
[SPEAKER_03]: have completely different characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the plants, you know,
which have an insane amount of resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, some of the plants have so much
resin coverage on them that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it could really, you know, rival any of
the hybrid varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we understand that all of these
places, you know, where high latitude,
[SPEAKER_03]: highland, you know, regions are of natural
cannabis varieties or for domesticated
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these places are luckily, you know,
situated in dangerous areas where,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, your green house or yellow house
seed company could not have gone,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, with their seeds or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we understand, you know, whatever we're
seeing there is a byproduct of the
[SPEAKER_03]: environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how you can basically classify
for categories.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can go on my website, that is www
.indianlandriskexchange.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have written an article that was
written, I think about a year,
[SPEAKER_03]: year and a half ago about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I need to amend a few things to it
because I'm always learning and trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: put together, you know, more information
in a more coherent manner.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you guys can go and actually read that
article, you know, if I may not be
[SPEAKER_03]: explaining it very well here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but that's one of the classifications
which I feel is really complete and it
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of encapsulates everything,
you know, that is present in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: hotspots where cannabis been growing
either traditionally for very long time or
[SPEAKER_03]: has been growing naturally or has been
domesticated.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only issue that I had later on was
with one of the regions that became
[SPEAKER_03]: apparent to me and that was the cold
desert regions like Neeti Valley in
[SPEAKER_03]: Uttarakhand.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is close to Indian-Tibetian border
and it's only at 31 degrees not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this place is not above 33 degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, the conditions, the environmental
conditions at Neeti Valley are exactly the
[SPEAKER_03]: same as they are in Hindu Kush
mountaintop.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are, first of all, let me just
explain it to you why it's that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because Neeti Valley is a cold desert
because it lies in the rain shadow of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Himalayas has a rain shadow and
anything that lies under it will never get
[SPEAKER_03]: the monsoon, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's gonna be absolutely dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one of the reasons it's
absolutely dry and, you know, arid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plants that grow there,
they kind of grow in exactly the similar
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions than compared to the plant
which are growing at high altitude and
[SPEAKER_03]: high latitude like Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they seem to acquire exactly the same
features as plants from Hindu Kush or
[SPEAKER_03]: plants from Chitral and these places,
except for when you go to Neeti Valley,
[SPEAKER_03]: there is no domestication that has
happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can apparently see a
short-statured plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the absence of moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows really tucked to the ground to
keep all the moisture intact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, flowers are dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: The resin is really dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Leaves are deeply sedated, which is very
characteristic of plants which come from,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, high latitude and high
altitudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see all those features and,
you know, we have, and that really
[SPEAKER_03]: solidifies our understanding that,
yes, indeed, environment is that one scale
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, we can map everything
against.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it will be really helpful
in understanding and in classifying these
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, this does not really
encapsulate any of the hybrid varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then if you wanna have a different
system for referring to hybrids,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think then somebody would have to,
you know, come up with a way to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was another classification which was
done after that because environment is not
[SPEAKER_03]: the only factor, even if it is the biggest
factor in shaping the way plants are.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second biggest factor is the human
beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, so we did a little, we made like
three different types on based on how
[SPEAKER_03]: human beings interact with the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first plants are, which are
completely wild primordial.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have no contact with human beings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Human beings have never domesticated them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have never fed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the second category we made is of
the directly affected wild plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Directly affected wild plants are
something you find in the cities.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are primordial varieties,
naturally occurring varieties,
[SPEAKER_03]: never been domesticated, but they're
getting affected by human presence.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting affected by the artificial
lightning, by all the pollution that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: creating and all the other situations,
you know, our cattle's graze on them and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those have, you know, driven some
changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once again, I wrote an article on that
that is also present on my website.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you guys wanna get a little more
insight into that, I would, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that you should read that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But coming back to the point, so that's
the second variety, which we classified in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of human interaction, that
varieties, which are also wild,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're affected by human beings,
not domesticated by them, affected by them
[SPEAKER_03]: because of our activities, because of what
happened after industrialization,
[SPEAKER_03]: industrial revolution, you know,
lights became widespread and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: things had to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you go look populations at,
you know, Punjab, what you see is that a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of plants now auto flower because,
you know, they are constantly growing
[SPEAKER_03]: under different light patterns from
artificial streetlights.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have figured out a way to,
you know, induce flowering without the
[SPEAKER_03]: light hours because that's a much better
way to reproduce in a situation where,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, light is not natural.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you see some of the plants,
you know, they have intersex tendencies
[SPEAKER_03]: and the auto flowering tendency,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of different things which are,
and these changes are more or less driven
[SPEAKER_03]: by our activities, our, you know,
involvement consciously and consciously
[SPEAKER_03]: with those plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we selected third variety,
I'm sorry, we made third category in terms
[SPEAKER_03]: of human interaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the domesticated varieties,
the traditional varieties like in Malana,
[SPEAKER_03]: in Uttarakhand, in Balochistan,
in Pakistan, in Afghanistan, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are actually, you know, affected by
human beings, but are actually
[SPEAKER_03]: domesticated, not affected in an adverse
manner.
[SPEAKER_03]: But are like cared for and, you know,
made into something which is more
[SPEAKER_03]: meaningful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a really comprehensive rundown.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my next question is quite broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand if you find it a bit hard
to give specific answers to, but everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak to who's really into land races
has this same sentiment where they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really tried an Indian land
race.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's one of those ones which
just doesn't get as much attention as some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other land races might you try to
compare India to?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just wanted to try to give someone
an idea, if you were like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of like a tie, but a bit
different, like, you know, how would you
[SPEAKER_00]: describe it to someone?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for framing it in that
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now it's really easy to make comparison
and answer that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, like you said, I mean, Indian
varieties, I mean, you know, they get like
[SPEAKER_03]: undermined big time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm telling you, you know,
even though there is a little bit of work
[SPEAKER_03]: involved there, because again,
like I said, and I accept this,
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, the domestication,
the level of domestication that has
[SPEAKER_03]: happened in India is nowhere close to what
has happened in places like Afghanistan or
[SPEAKER_03]: Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So rightly so, people are right in
choosing those varieties more often over
[SPEAKER_03]: the Indians or even some of the Southeast
Asians for that reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think another reason that's there is
really the cultural reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to try to, you know,
I'm going to actually try to first of all
[SPEAKER_03]: answer the other question that I would say
if you go to Kashmir, if you go to
[SPEAKER_03]: Southern Kashmir or Pulwama or Srinagar,
how I see those plants look very similar
[SPEAKER_03]: to your Ethiopian plants, you know,
the Ethiopian, the plant that come from
[SPEAKER_03]: Ethiopian islands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're very, you know, spindly and
they look absolutely the same to the
[SPEAKER_03]: Kashmiri varieties, at least to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, that's one of the very
sought after varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the South Indians, like Kerala and
Shilavati, they're like pretty synonymous
[SPEAKER_03]: to your average, you know, Southeast Asian
varieties that comes from Thailand and
[SPEAKER_03]: other places like Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now coming back to the cultural reason
that I was going to touch upon actually,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is, I think, I mean, try to think
about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the varieties which are really famous
in America or in the larger world are the
[SPEAKER_03]: ones where America had like had a war.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they had a Vietnam war and like
Vietnamese seems to be very famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, they constantly have,
you know, something going on in a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghanistan for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Afghanistan seems to be, you know,
of, you know, seems to be very famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are a few things we have to
understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first is the psycholinguistic
aspect of it, that if you're going to hear
[SPEAKER_03]: about something for so long or you have
certain memories attached to it,
[SPEAKER_03]: right, so you're naturally going to
incline more towards those things,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though you don't understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there are a lot of people who have
never actually had a pure Vietnamese and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to tell you that is the best
weed in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that tells you something about,
you know, how people are getting to this
[SPEAKER_03]: conclusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm sure there are some killer
varieties coming from Vietnam,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people have had them and some
people truly know that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: these are mind boggling stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You run into one of those psychedelic,
you know, plants that induce the
[SPEAKER_03]: psychedelic effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really uncanny to feel that way on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But do we really feel that everybody has
gone through that kind of experience?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of the, you know,
opinion that people have about these
[SPEAKER_03]: different varieties is just shaped by
because of the culture, the way cultures
[SPEAKER_03]: have been and the way our emotions are
attached to certain places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also because you had a war in like
Vietnam, or let's say somebody had a war
[SPEAKER_03]: in like Afghanistan, then there is a
bigger, there's a fat probability that
[SPEAKER_03]: that person is going to get some seeds
back, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can only appreciate things that
you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you only have Vietnamese and
Afghani, then of course you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciate them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't appreciate something you don't
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in a way, in a subjective way that
you've had them, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's only a matter of time as
the Indian varieties become more available
[SPEAKER_03]: to people that people would understand
that, however, it requires a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: work, but there are so much untapped
potential in these lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there is no one way to
really work with those varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen people work with them,
you know, in different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people just try to find very nice
plant out of a thousand plants and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, reverse it and just go from
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people like to, you know,
select for traits and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually homogenize them and then,
you know, work them, work with those
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties as true breeding varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people just take them and,
you know, hit it with other hybrids and
[SPEAKER_03]: that creates fantastic plants as well,
requires some sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: selection work later on, but all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think once these things become more
prevalent, it becomes like a norm because
[SPEAKER_03]: I have been, you know, doing this for
about like five years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can tell you this, that five years
ago, you know, when I was on Facebook and
[SPEAKER_03]: I initially come here, I mean,
people were not as inclined, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: towards collecting and preserving the
Andes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not trying to say that people
weren't doing that, you know, because it
[SPEAKER_03]: could be viewed as that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not because there were a lot of
people who I consider to be legends,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like Bodhi is there and then you
have Snow High and, you know, I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: name a lot of other people, but,
you know, I couldn't, but all these people
[SPEAKER_03]: that they have done all that work,
you know, so nobody's saying that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it wasn't done, but it was not
widespread.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that, you know,
people were, how should I say this?
[SPEAKER_03]: People readily wanted to, you know,
get these varieties and grow them because
[SPEAKER_03]: the culture was just not, you know,
the cultural, the flow of the market as
[SPEAKER_03]: well, because, you know, there's a market
which we cannot ignore, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to understand the dynamics are
such that people are inclined towards
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties, you know, which will finish
faster and, you know, which are being
[SPEAKER_03]: hyped by the media or the social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of, there's a lot of small
things, you know, which have contributed
[SPEAKER_03]: so far, you know, in Indian varieties,
not really being, you know, one of the,
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the ones which are sought after
really, when you talk about Landry as a
[SPEAKER_03]: whole, but I think at the same time,
the same technology helped people from
[SPEAKER_03]: India to connect with all across the
people on the globe and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: really get these seeds out to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only now that people are
beginning to understand that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: no cannabis is bad or a good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you have to grow enough of it
to find that great one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an awesome sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just to jump off topic for one
second, cause you kind of brought it up
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you describe the effect that
social media such as Instagram has had
[SPEAKER_00]: over the cannabis scene and the community
within India?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it changed it fundamentally in your
opinion?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it has, it has a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Instagram has done possibly a
lot more than YouTube, Facebook,
[SPEAKER_03]: and all the other platforms we know of put
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because first of all, you know,
when Instagram came in, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: it gives you a seamless, you know,
platform to just go ahead and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, upload pictures and talk about
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's basically like just being in,
being in that place and listening to that
[SPEAKER_03]: person's story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really intuitive, first of all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that had a very deep impact on
the people in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: And apart from that, all the information
that is coming from the Western world,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, because now people in India,
a significant amount of people in India
[SPEAKER_03]: knows what OG is, what cookies,
I mean, they don't know about all the,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, stories behind them and all the
contours.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't want to say it,
but from the lowest common denominator
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of sources, you know, who just brings
it down to a point where, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: more people can understand it opposed to a
thing being more factual.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think because the social media
is more inclined towards making it more
[SPEAKER_03]: universal to wider audiences, they seem
to, you know, lose on a lot of content,
[SPEAKER_03]: which could have been, you know,
a lot more meaningful than would have
[SPEAKER_03]: imparted knowledge in a sense that people
would then be curious because see,
[SPEAKER_03]: you cannot teach someone in one video or
in one audio and one picture, whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be a relentless process from the
person itself of learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all you can do is you can incite the
curiosity inside that person by telling
[SPEAKER_03]: him the truth, telling him, you know,
how things exactly are and how there are
[SPEAKER_03]: some things we don't understand and how
there are some things we understand now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think unless you're leading these
people into a larger pursuit for
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding the plan, then we're just
creating a similar society here,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where people would just fall back to some
of the well-known and respected varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: like OG and Coquiza and, you know,
they would breed with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of people who are actually
breeding in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're not necessarily in India
on Instagram or Facebook for obvious
[SPEAKER_03]: reasons, but there is a lot of work going
on and all credits to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: social media.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has really brought nothing short of a
revolution, if I may say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a, what a great path for us to go
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to keep going down this
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, my first question is,
do you see what we would refer to as Kali
[SPEAKER_00]: import within India?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, a lot, a lot, a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, more than you would think.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, first of all, let me go ahead and
put things in perspective for you that in
[SPEAKER_03]: India, if you have hybrid wheat,
as we call it, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: In India, if you have hybrid wheat,
it sells for anything between 800 to 1000
[SPEAKER_03]: US dollars for every hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is, that is the least price that you
will get it for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, there'll be instances
you might be spending like $1,500 or
[SPEAKER_03]: $1,200 because it's not available in India
and there is no such quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no such thing as quality in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: About when it comes to hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have hybrid, if it looks
different enough from the conventional
[SPEAKER_03]: wheat and you can say it's hybrid and it
would sell for seven, 800, 900,
[SPEAKER_03]: 1000 US dollars, man, like whatever you
feel like scalping off of other people,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I mean, they love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because the prices they get from,
you know, people in US, it's just insane
[SPEAKER_03]: because I know I had some friends,
you know, who would send an ounce for like
[SPEAKER_03]: a hundred bucks, like a hundred dollars,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if, imagine if you could just get an
ounce for a hundred dollars from US and
[SPEAKER_03]: you could sell it for a thousand dollars
in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's insane, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you'd be, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd be pretty rich, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I mean, this is a
whole different domain, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: people who sell wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so, but I'm just trying to put
things into perspective that that's how
[SPEAKER_03]: people, you know, view wheat in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the price is like, I mean,
that that's the kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: price tag that comes with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, a lot of people are smoking it
at the same time, but it's not readily
[SPEAKER_03]: available for Indians here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you, we do see a lot of bags of
cookies and runs, you know, making it
[SPEAKER_03]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you see runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I got to kind of like a
little triple question here for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first part is do many people grow
indoors and are there any kind of strains
[SPEAKER_00]: which are grown locally, which people are
well aware of, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the Indian blue dream type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most of the people grow indoors
because of the obvious reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not being legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people are blessed to be in
places like one of my friends who's
[SPEAKER_03]: actually one of the guys who breeds along
with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He lives in a place where he can grow it
outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, because there's nobody
around him, but most people, this is not
[SPEAKER_03]: the case for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, we have to stick to the
indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now to the more interesting question,
you asked the local variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is one such variety, but I cannot
vouch whether it's simply being,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, bred out of cattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gold or whether it's a combination of
Kerala gold and hybrid that was then
[SPEAKER_03]: selected, you know, which so I don't
understand that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a strain called Sheila with the
and you can Google it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would recommend you Google that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just write Sheila with the in Google.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you the spellings later.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would see that, you know,
there's so much being written about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's grown in South India.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this variety is not confined to one
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's grown all over South India.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it makes it over to North India.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody knows the names.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody seemed to know the name of
because it would get you higher than any
[SPEAKER_03]: other weed, you know, and it has a dense
structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the buds, I mean, they're not
dense like the like Oji or cookie dense,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, you know, they're relatively dense
when you compare it to Kerala or its
[SPEAKER_03]: predecessors like Iduki gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it has a great smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has, you know, probably a more intense
smell and the high is better.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's it's really taking India by storm.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, you can't really compare it to,
you know, some of the varieties that you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys have been able to breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, nowhere close to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But sure, yeah, we're getting there
slowly, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's that's still really cool to
hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people are doing their little
indoor grows or even outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do people tend to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they do it organically in soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they use salts like what's the most
common style you see?
[SPEAKER_03]: In India, most people choose to grow
organically, and it is not based on how
[SPEAKER_03]: they feel about, you know, different
growing methods.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you an example for in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I see or at least I feel is that why
people choose to grow with salts or
[SPEAKER_03]: no-till or water, whatever, is because of
how they feel about, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's grown organically or if it's grown
with salts.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not the case in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: In India, I think it's driven by something
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't at least the younger
generation is not really sensitive about
[SPEAKER_03]: this organic, non-organic thing,
because we're just in a different sphere
[SPEAKER_03]: here in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the things come organically to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are more concerned about how can I
spend the least amount of money and still
[SPEAKER_03]: pull off a grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that inevitably leads you towards
organic growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really what the motivation is
behind more people actually doing organic
[SPEAKER_03]: and very few people actually using these
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you which people do use
these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very synonymous to the Western
countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who are growing for selling the
wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there are a lot of people who are
pumping units from their houses,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like growing in the tents and like
big rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they feel that, you know, if they can
use these nutrients, which come from
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe and America, then their wheat would
look as good as theirs look in picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's, I mean, and you know how that
translates in the end, but at least that's
[SPEAKER_03]: how those people feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they tend to spend a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other hand, you know, they don't
have a concern around money because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're actually getting paid for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not growing it for their
consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have a whole different financial
situation going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can actually think about,
you know, using something like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, expensive fertilizers,
which come from countries like America,
Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are different groups,
but basically that's what the thinking is
[SPEAKER_03]: in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, that certainly makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially considering most things are
organic, you could understand most people
[SPEAKER_00]: would do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of stay on this general
topic, what would be your advice to
[SPEAKER_00]: someone if they've just flown into India
somewhere, is there kind of like a general
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy you would advise for them to be
able to track down some weed or do they
[SPEAKER_00]: really just need to like ask around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what's the way to go about doing
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you had it too, because India is
such a diverse country when it comes to
[SPEAKER_03]: culture and people and languages and so
much more, you know, every 10 kilometres
[SPEAKER_03]: language changes, you know, the dress
changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So does the culture and the way people
behave and people feel about certain
[SPEAKER_03]: things, which also involves cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, if you go to Uttarakhand,
that is my hometown, and you see a very
[SPEAKER_03]: relaxed kind of demeanour towards cannabis
from other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, you could literally go
to a tea shop and you could, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: buy a tea and after five minutes,
you could ask him, you know, hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you could like help me score some.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if he doesn't have some, you know,
he will like let you know where you can
[SPEAKER_03]: get some.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, if he doesn't, then you
would slightly say that, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: or he would probably send you to another
guy who would be able to help you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're going to, let's say,
South India, it's not recommended that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you go ask any random person,
but you rather try to connect with the
[SPEAKER_03]: youth in South India, because in South
India, the younger people are a lot more
[SPEAKER_03]: into cannabis than I would say in North
India.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a very good probability if
you're speaking to someone, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: who's between 18 to 30 years old,
that he would know the whereabouts of the
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in North India, yeah, pretty much you
can like speak to the people who are
[SPEAKER_03]: driving, you know, go-kart rickshaws or
who are selling, you know, cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are the go-to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, you go, the best place
you can go to is go to a guy who's,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, driving that go-kart rickshaw
kind of thing, you know, the three
[SPEAKER_03]: wheeler.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you guys call that over
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, rickshaw, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those people are really famous and even
so much that, you know, when our parents
[SPEAKER_03]: had to scold us for like, or had to tell
us that weed is bad, they would say that,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, this is the drug of those rickshaw
pullers, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you smoke it and you're like,
yeah, you're like them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's so engraved in the culture
that, you know, it becomes something,
[SPEAKER_03]: it becomes something of an expression to
scare kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to, I mean, I mean,
we generalize a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no, I totally understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, if we just kind of move on to
kind of the physical landscape a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more, what's the soil like to growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you mentioned that people tend to
grow organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the soil well suited in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it rich in nutrients, fairly depleted?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do people work with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now soil is a very important aspect for
growing plants as we all know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think there's a vast difference
between how things are happening in,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to talk about Europe because
I'm not really aware of that, but in terms
[SPEAKER_03]: of America and India, I can draw like this
little comparison that in America,
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of people buy soils and for
someone in India, that is completely
[SPEAKER_03]: insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, nobody would give money
for soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not in a way insulting other
people, but you have to understand from
[SPEAKER_03]: our culture, we don't pay for soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we pay for food.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't pay for soil ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what, another reason behind that is
because most of the soil is fertile here
[SPEAKER_03]: because what is Northern India,
by the way, Northern India used to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: big floodplain for all these different
rivers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there are only five rivers flowing
from Punjab itself that used to at least,
[SPEAKER_03]: and all of the soil that is here is
actually your alluvial deposits and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, the minerals, you know, which the
rivers have, you know, flown down into
[SPEAKER_03]: these plains from the mountainous regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the soil is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's alluvial soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly like it has a clay loam,
like texture, you know, at some places
[SPEAKER_03]: it's more yellowish.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to other places, it's a little bit
dark, but soil is really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, the pH is right around like
seven, I think like seven, around like
[SPEAKER_03]: seven, 7.2.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just hovers around that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's perfect for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and even, you know, if there are
some varieties, you know, which do not
[SPEAKER_03]: thrive in like higher pH because you're
using the natural soil, you have the
[SPEAKER_03]: indigenous microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're just going to,
you know, equalize that effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're going to contract that
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, you know,
we have to be very careful when using,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, things like mycorrhizae because
we're using indigenous soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's already a species of that,
you know, which is present.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, sometimes people would buy
mycorrhizae from outside of India and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you would have two different species
competing and, you know, it could lead to
[SPEAKER_03]: other problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, overall, we mostly have this,
you know, clay, loam and alluvial
[SPEAKER_03]: deposits, you know, vast deposits of
alluvial soil and, you know, the cow dung
[SPEAKER_03]: is just free.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get it from anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in India, I mean, people really don't
have that kind of like soil buying culture
[SPEAKER_03]: or like nutrient buying culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's certainly coming to India.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to say that Amazon is not
now selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazon is selling soil, but I don't think
a lot of people are buying it as of now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the culture is due for a change.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things are going to change, you know,
because, of course, the economy is also
[SPEAKER_03]: getting stronger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, apart from this coronavirus thing
that just happened now, apart from that,
[SPEAKER_03]: things were going good for India.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think eventually because people are
going to, you know, going to be making
[SPEAKER_03]: more money and they would be more
resourceful, they will eventually be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to move on to the ideas like, hey,
let's try to invest in soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try to buy soil and see if that
makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it would make a difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, while the clay and the
loam is great, but I just feel there are
[SPEAKER_03]: certain properties, you know, that could
be changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's not very loose, you know,
it's not very, it's very compact.
[SPEAKER_03]: So certain properties like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But overall, the soil works fantastically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the, I mean, North India is
the Mecca of cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of these varieties has been
naturally growing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I could say very confidently that the
soil that's in Northern India,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least in Northern India or Northwest
Himalayas is very suited for growing
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why most people just go ahead,
you know, dig some soil and they're good
[SPEAKER_03]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, it makes total sense,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You raise an interesting point though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really be interested to see what
some of these cultivars would end up
[SPEAKER_00]: looking like around harvest time if they
were put in some kind of like American
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I remember my first run with that
sort of soil composition and it was quite
[SPEAKER_00]: different to what I was using before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, it was a very different
outcome for the same clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to get back on topic, for the people
who are just using the soil around them,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just free, do they try to
supplement it with like basic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, like basic compost they
make or anything, or is it really just
[SPEAKER_00]: planted in the soil, water only,
and what you get's what you get?
[SPEAKER_03]: People do make compost because compost
making has been an integral part of Indian
[SPEAKER_03]: culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's something that people are readily
aware of.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've seen a lot of people use,
you know, compost, they have compost bins
[SPEAKER_03]: or they have a designated place or a pit
where they, you know, stockpile all the
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves and, you know, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, that happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, I mean, the nutrient part is
people are not big on nutrients,
[SPEAKER_03]: like buying nutrients, like buying soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I said, if someone is running a
commercial setup, you know, he's able to
[SPEAKER_03]: sell it for a fortune, then of course they
can afford it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they are doing that because they don't
want to leave any stone unturned and
[SPEAKER_03]: making their weed the best in the market,
right, and probably make more money off
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, they can afford it
because they have, they're getting some
[SPEAKER_03]: returns out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the same time, there are other
people, you know, who are interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: doing that because at the end,
the plant grows amazing in that soil
[SPEAKER_03]: without any inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you see a lot of cow dung being used,
which is just, you know, very inherent to
[SPEAKER_03]: people in India.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I mean, we use cow dung for a lot
of other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we you know, like dry it up and,
you know, smoke it, like burn it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it takes care of the mosquitoes because
we, you know, we have a big mosquito
[SPEAKER_03]: problem in India, as you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always around us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's only a matter of, for us,
it's only a matter of time, a matter of
[SPEAKER_03]: looking around and, you know, finding
those things and fertilize it and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything is just all around us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because the cattle are also,
you know, going around everywhere,
[SPEAKER_03]: so they're taking shit and it's getting
mixed in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the soil seems to be really good
overall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people are not really inclined towards
using nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people do use them, but it's a
negligible portion of the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: overall community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really good answer to that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Indian climate itself, you know,
I know that it can get quite hot and also
[SPEAKER_00]: quite cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel that impacts things?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for how many months of the year can
you grow in say North India, for example?
[SPEAKER_03]: In North India, I mean, if you are at a
fairly lower altitude, like I am right
[SPEAKER_03]: now, I'm at near Shivalik right now,
and I think around 700 meters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it does not snow at all,
but it gets really cold in the winters,
[SPEAKER_03]: but not as cold that you cannot grow the
cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can go 12 years, I'm sorry,
12 months, and you can grow pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: around the year, but there's a significant
change in the light duration.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not like equator that you
have a 12 hour day all around the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because of that reason, then you would
have to supplement light or you would have
[SPEAKER_03]: to, you know, wedge your plants inside if
you're going to do that towards the end of
[SPEAKER_03]: the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say if I decide to, you know,
grow my plants in October, after just
[SPEAKER_03]: going through my first cycle, then I would
have to give them some vegetative time
[SPEAKER_03]: indoors or have to please supplement some
light outdoors in my balcony or whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: to make sure that, you know, they stay in
vegetative state for a significant amount
[SPEAKER_03]: of time before they hit the flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you can, you know, eventually have
something on the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that 12 months are available,
but then you have to look at the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: The light is not really in your favor all
the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing that happens around here in
North India is that what you see these
[SPEAKER_03]: federal varieties, which are growing in
the flatlands, especially Punjab,
[SPEAKER_03]: Haryana, New Delhi surroundings,
these plants grow all around the year,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, like you would see in some
of the Equators.
[SPEAKER_03]: That means in springtime, some of the
plants would come up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would go on to, they would
suddenly go into flowering because the
[SPEAKER_03]: light is still less than, you know,
is still relatively less, but they would
[SPEAKER_03]: just kind of stretch and not really start
to flower because these are long flowering
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties and they tend to have a stretch
before they really start to flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those varieties will, you know,
stretch and then they would again go into
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetative state as the summer would hit
around like end of April and May.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they would again go into flowers
sometime in, you know, around August then,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they would finish somewhere around
like November ending.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as soon as the November end comes and
those seeds, you know, fall down on the
[SPEAKER_03]: ground, I mean, they don't stay dormant
like some of the places like Kashmir where
[SPEAKER_03]: because in Kashmir, what happens is once
the seed falls down, there's snowfall on
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those plants have evolved different
features in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some of the plants in colder places
like Kashmir in higher altitudes where the
[SPEAKER_03]: snowfall happens for like two to four
months, they have developed features like
[SPEAKER_03]: seed dormancy, which can be chemically or
physically induced, like physically
[SPEAKER_03]: induced in a way that it could have a very
thick seed coat, you know, that will take
[SPEAKER_03]: a very long while to wither and eventually
it'll take the time till the snow is off
[SPEAKER_03]: and it will ultimately, you know,
pop out in spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one is that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's chemical dormancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that is caused because
of the abscisic acid in the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really the only way to, you know,
break that is you have to take those seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: and put it in the refrigerator and,
you know, mimic what would happen in what
[SPEAKER_03]: would have happened in the nature,
like it would have been under the snow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you keep it like a couple of months
under in the refrigerator and then you try
[SPEAKER_03]: to pop them in and they pop, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that doesn't really happen in here,
Northern India, because here you have the
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: They fall down on the ground and next week
they're out because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not snowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that cold that they're going to
die.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just have this perpetually
seedlings coming up and plants going into
[SPEAKER_03]: flower at different stages and reverting
to vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a very complex picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have to live here and you have
to go out and, you know, with a little
[SPEAKER_03]: notebook every day and just look around
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not that hard to understand,
but it's complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if somebody is going to come here for
like a day or two from a different
[SPEAKER_03]: country, I think it's going to be very
difficult for him to really appreciate all
[SPEAKER_03]: those little things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge layer of complexity to it
all with everything going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know, though, you've spoken
about how there's all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: areas geographically with India.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've got like the high
altitudes, the lower, some kind of in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle and even deserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of all of them, what produces the
nicest end product in your experience?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you're going to talk about the
nicest end product, I mean, there could be
[SPEAKER_03]: a few ways of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some people would say bigger bud or
some people would say more potent resin,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to talk in different aspects.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, like I'm going to say that this region
or this place would produce the best of
[SPEAKER_03]: this certain characteristic.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so first, if we if we begin with cold
desert region, a cold desert is basically
[SPEAKER_03]: what it's extremely cold place and,
you know, that it doesn't rain at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe once or twice a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all you see is just a rock withering
away in a very arid, desolate region.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have some plants growing in those
regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So number one, I'm going to put those
plants right up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: For their hardiness and for their survival
skills.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're going to, you know,
if you're going to look for a variety,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that has the abilities to
survive in least amount of water and in
[SPEAKER_03]: marginal conditions as they are in,
you know, cold desert, then that would be,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the number one for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, but then let's talk about in terms of
resin production.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, and when we say resin production,
I'm talking about in how dense the resin
[SPEAKER_03]: coating is.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, and whether it's confined only to the
floral bracts or is it also moving on to
[SPEAKER_03]: the leaves and to the stems and the
perioles?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, because some varieties do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once again, if you go to cold desert
regions like Neeti Valley, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: close to the Tibetan border in Chamoli,
those plants tend to have a very dense,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, coverage of resin, surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the trichomes are big as well,
even though the plants are really feeble
[SPEAKER_03]: and small, they have absolutely zero,
you know, vigor to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they barely look like cannabis plants,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you would find plants which have this
amazing and parallel amount of resin on
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And similar is the case with Kashmir,
I mean, the places.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically what I'm trying to say here
is that if you go to the colder places and
[SPEAKER_03]: more drier places, places like Hindu Kush,
places like Chitral in Pakistan,
[SPEAKER_03]: places like, you know, Neeti Valley,
and you're going to encounter,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, populations which have a dense
resin coating and, you know, the resin is
[SPEAKER_03]: abundant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that could be because these places
are higher up on the latitude,
[SPEAKER_03]: higher up on the globe and, you know,
also have altitudes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they may be exposed to, you know,
a more intense ultraviolet radiation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't understand, you know,
what basically trichomes are doing or what
[SPEAKER_03]: all they're doing, at least.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it is to deflect, you know,
UV radiation, then certainly it makes
[SPEAKER_03]: sense, you know, why those varieties would
have bigger trichomes and a more dense
[SPEAKER_03]: coverage, even on the non-reproductive
parts like leaves and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: perioles of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're going to talk about the
girth, if you're going to talk about the
[SPEAKER_03]: produce, well, it's absolutely zero in
these places.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to Kashmir and you go to places
like Neeti Valley, the cold desert places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, the cold is doing something
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cold is somewhat like a factor that is
directly influencing, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: these changes that while the resin coating
is going to be absolutely maddening on the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, the plant is not the plant itself
is not going to produce anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: You may even see plants that has no bud at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just a couple of floral bracts
here and there and leaves coming out of
[SPEAKER_03]: them, but they're just completely
smothered with resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what you see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not fully complete.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have certain aspects, you know,
which are really desirable to us,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you talk in terms of like commercial
production, but they don't have all of
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just seem to have like one or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you could move to the other
extreme and the other extreme is the
[SPEAKER_03]: equatorials.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you go to the equatorials,
what do you see equatorial regions?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you see is that the plants produce
huge buds, huge yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, it's hard to find a
plant that is not yielding a lot,
[SPEAKER_03]: but when you get closer and you try to
look at the resin production, it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: even close, not even close to,
you know, what you have seen in places
[SPEAKER_03]: like cold desert or in places like
Kashmir, you know, not even close.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sparsely scattered and it's very
hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very hardly you see that on,
you know, patios or on the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's mostly confined to the reproductive
part.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, we don't understand,
you know, what all things, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: trichomes do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can't really say what's driving
that, but at least that's what we see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at least we can, you know,
relate it to, you know, the environment
[SPEAKER_03]: because those results, because those
observations kind of hold up even if you
[SPEAKER_03]: go to different places with different
cultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that it's not because of the
domestication.
[SPEAKER_03]: We understand that this is something which
is inherent to these varieties or inherent
[SPEAKER_03]: to this terroir that they are growing in
and they've been growing in for so long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then what's left?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's left is in between your highlands,
your, the places which are, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: very close to, you know, a tropic of
cancer around like 28, 26, 29 degrees,
[SPEAKER_03]: 30, 31 degrees of North.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also seem to have a little bit of
highlands.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, because the temperature is
cold, but at the same time, it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: extremely cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you get is a beautiful mix of
both of those words.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get good resin content.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say at least decent resin content
and you can find plants which more than
[SPEAKER_03]: often would produce, you know,
good yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then it only becomes a matter of,
you know, looking for the right plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and just growing enough to run
into a plant that you can say,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you could say that, yeah,
this is, this is it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I, you know, what is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if somebody is going to find that ideal
plant and then either he would have to
[SPEAKER_03]: take both of the extremes and,
you know, cross them and just go from
[SPEAKER_03]: there or he would just have to look for
these intermediate varieties from
[SPEAKER_03]: highlands of, which grow around the tropic
of cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, have, seem to have best of
both worlds to some extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a really awesomely detailed
explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think viewers will probably have to
listen to that one a few times to pick out
[SPEAKER_00]: all the awesome bits of info there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have it guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part one of two done.
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just buckets of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iris ink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scholar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are getting ready for part
two.
