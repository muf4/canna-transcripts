[SPEAKER_01]: considerate about their respiratory
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, Dynavap are the world leaders in
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynavap helped me to transition from bongs
to vaping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you what, I've never looked back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their unit is the most potent,
the most highly replicating of a bong hit
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever come across.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through their incredible M unit,
I was able to successfully get off bongs a
[SPEAKER_01]: few years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly one of the most innovative and
interesting vapes on the market,
[SPEAKER_01]: using a totally different design to other
uses found.

[SPEAKER_01]: On today, we're incredibly stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part two of an incredible, incredibly epic
episode with none other than Mojave
[SPEAKER_01]: Richmond of the Bioagronomics Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here to chat all things breeding,
history, Big Sur, collaborations with Rob
[SPEAKER_01]: Clark and predictions for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without further delay, let's jump into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to jump back to the story,
but before we do one last thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you mentioned at the start of that answer
that you had already met Rob by that
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me a bit about it, because if people
weren't aware, you know, Rob's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: come back into the story in a bit more
full force.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your first encounter with Rob
like and what was your relationship?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you just casually knowing him when
you were in Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I met Rob, we became friends
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for one, he was, you know,
like I'm the young, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the youngest of six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of my peer group was always a
little older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like meeting Rob, he's a California
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just loves cannabis, like, and he's
just super smart and he's a worldly guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so like we had this kind of
connection, I'd say almost beyond cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, we talked about weed a
lot and we definitely shared a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, but we used to get together on,
you know, we'd have these Wednesday
[SPEAKER_00]: gatherings where we'd get together and
we'd bring bottles of red wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd talk about anthropology and his
trips to China and Vietnam and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't so much me geeking out on
meeting Rob Clark, because I didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: have that perspective yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like I do now, you know, like I really
appreciate what Rob has done for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for our community and for,
you know, the knowledge base and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, he was just a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he was a cool guy to hang out
with and, you know, share space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the time, over years,
I just come to realize that this guy has
[SPEAKER_00]: this wealth of knowledge about not just
the plant, but a certain way of looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, a certain perspective,
a bigger picture perspective, a
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective that's kind of outside of any
one market or outside of any one time or
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of any one region, you know,
it's cannabis big C, genus cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's been, you know, knowing Rob
for 31 years or so and working together
[SPEAKER_00]: over the last nine years has been like one
of the greatest privileges of my life to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of just intersect with someone as
smart as he is and as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with such a such a global and big picture
perspective on not just cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but life, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I met a lot of, I met a lot of wild
characters in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met all the, you know, wild,
charismatic, traveling cannabis roadshow
[SPEAKER_00]: dudes who would come through the cannabis
cup, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them were wacky and weird and
strange, you know, from another planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them were really far out and
really smart, cutting edge people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one thing that was weird is like
being an American overseer overseas while
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition is still like marching on back
home was a bit odd, you know, to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam when it was so free and so open.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, you know, I'd come
home every year and it was still the way
[SPEAKER_00]: it was, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, you know, the first wave of
people who came to Amsterdam were,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they were, they called them the
Reagan refugees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they were, they were escaping
this incredibly oppressive drug war,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and trying to find somewhere
else to live, just to feel open enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: not just grow, but to have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for guys like Rob Clark and David
Watson was to actually do research and
[SPEAKER_00]: work and push everything forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like they really augured in to
like, well, if you're going to let me do
[SPEAKER_00]: it, what can I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and the, and the stuff that
those guys did in, you know, a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 or so years is just, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still kind of unmatched today
for, you know, how much zeal and
[SPEAKER_00]: motivation and what they were trying to
accomplish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I just, I always, you know,
give kudos to, to, you know, those who
[SPEAKER_00]: deserve it, because it was a very
different time, you know, to think about
[SPEAKER_00]: what they did with Horta Farm and all the
research and all the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the projects that they were involved
with and the books that were written and
[SPEAKER_00]: the, you know, travels and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's, you know, will never
happen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hopefully, hopefully it'll never
happen again, because hopefully we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: never fall back into prohibition that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was a unique time,
unique guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if he'll come up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to quickly ask you, why do you
think Dave Watson has historically been
[SPEAKER_01]: portrayed as a villain by some,
when in my opinion, it seems quite obvious
[SPEAKER_01]: to me, he's on the Mount Rushmore of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you think some people have such
polarized views about him?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, similar, I mean,
think about the big Sir Holy Weed story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when you create a vacuum and
there's no information there, people just
[SPEAKER_00]: fill that vacuum with information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way our brains work,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just say, you can't just leave
it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rob and David were not trying to
advertise all the work they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and they're also weren't trying
to brag about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they weren't trying to defend
themselves from people who were pointing
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers, you know, creating stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that didn't, that wasn't part of
their agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they weren't the guys, like they
weren't part of the circus, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cannabis cup circus of people
running around waving flags and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were really legitimate research
scientists, cannabis enthusiasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: guys who love weed more than anybody else
in the world, you know, and seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and really trying to do good
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, everyone,
you know, like, well, how does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, of course it's strange and odd
at the time because we're in the throes of
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and there wasn't much that you could
say back then, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the stories and all the lore that
came along over the ages, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were just filling that vacuum,
you know, and now in hindsight,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty clear what all those stories
were, you know, and there's plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: historic record, but that doesn't change
people's opinions on the truth much
[SPEAKER_00]: because it doesn't change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, think about how people think,
think about all the opinions people have
[SPEAKER_00]: about all the other things in the world
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, no, it's a shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, and that's as an
industry and as a community, we are all
[SPEAKER_00]: very guarded and, you know, we've been,
we've had our backs against the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that we, we still feel
that we're still very cautious of
[SPEAKER_00]: corporations and, you know, capitalist
influence and big tobacco and biotech and
[SPEAKER_00]: all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really worried that they're going to
do something, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get why people, you know, people are
afraid that someone's out to do something,
[SPEAKER_00]: do harm to mother cannabis or the people
who follow her.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but all I can say having known
David and known Rob quite well is that
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys love cannabis more than anybody
and have tried harder than anybody to push
[SPEAKER_00]: things forward in the face of incredible
self-risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, so, and, and, and, and like
what, what were the alternatives at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, you know, when someone's out there
spreading rumors about you, what,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are your alternatives to go out there
publicly and deny them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think part of the strategy was just
like, I'm not going to, I don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to comment on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that conspiracy loves a no comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it's still, it's still today,
you know, it's still, people still have
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but it's just, just like,
you know, and that even, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: on into, you know, phylos and,
you know, all these other people worried
[SPEAKER_00]: that Monsanto is going to take cannabis
away from us and that there's bad players.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's like, I mean,
when science, science and industry marches
[SPEAKER_00]: forward, you know, capitalism plays a
role, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always, there's always going to be
people who take advantages of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like that, you know, don't hold
any one person responsible for being,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, everything for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, well, I mean, while we're on the topic
of the phylos thing, what was your
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think that at this point,
it's sort of inevitable that for anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: who's going to offer that sort of
sequencing, like of course the data
[SPEAKER_01]: collection is going to inherently be like
a value and probably monetized and in a
[SPEAKER_01]: similar sense, maybe this time they'll,
they'll package the delivery a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: palatable than what we got.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, like, do you think it's
essentially to get that service,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same outcome is likely to occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's a duplicitous of the
messaging that if you're saying like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I mean, that's why people are upset
with 23andMe now is because they finally
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out that the data was more
valuable than the test, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That they gave you this, you pay a hundred
bucks and they give you a test,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really what, what they're really
getting out of it is your data and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: selling that to, you know, biotech or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where phylos got thrown
under the bus was that they were saying
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing and doing another, you know,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to me, it's, it's just an
inevitable aspect of, of anything that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that all the different dynamics
of, of agriculture and horticulture and
[SPEAKER_00]: capital capitalism and supply chain
dynamics are going to play a role in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and in a way, I think there's one
camp, there's one camp that feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis should be held accountable for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning like it can only be treated with
an ethical perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if we're going to re, if we're
going to normalize cannabis, we should
[SPEAKER_00]: also be normalizing regenerative farming
and we should also normalize, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: fair trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we should also normalize all these
other components that we should for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of feel like that's unfair to
cannabis as the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fair to the farmer in the community
and the consumer to have that perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to hold cannabis accountable,
to say that with this plant, you can't do
[SPEAKER_00]: all the things that you guys do with all
the other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we're not allowed, you're not
allowed to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sacred.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, I think that that's not
realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some ways it's not fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's probably irrelevant because
back to the whole diversity thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what their efforts are,
you know, it's still just going to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the next greatest thing that some
kid pulls out of an eighth or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, and all the genomic data,
you know, is only good for people who can
[SPEAKER_00]: use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, no one's really created a lot
of value or utility in that data in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of creating market products and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just don't worry about any of that,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like it's a symptom of us
being beat down by prohibition that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: so susceptible to that, that, you know,
just let cannabis be still.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we went to, we went to these USDA
field trials and it was, it was amazing to
[SPEAKER_00]: go up in Geneva, New York, you know,
in this collaboration with Cornell,
[SPEAKER_00]: the USDA is doing these field trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cornell's doing research and they're doing
breeding for fiber and grain and blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, and drug types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had this, you know, the USDA had,
I think it was 500 sessions of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, land race and feral and all
kinds of stuff, open pollinated in a big
[SPEAKER_00]: giant field, thousands of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they're just getting,
they're just dipping their toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, they've, they've collected
germplasm and data years ago that they all
[SPEAKER_00]: lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all just getting started
again, or they destroyed or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: happened, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, they're all just getting
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Industry is just getting back into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, research is just getting back
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, ag is getting into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharma is getting into it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I don't think any of us should
not allow anyone, no one should get in the
[SPEAKER_00]: way of all that happening, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that is kind of like back to
this, you know, is it cannabis or is it a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if it's a cannabis industry,
then Lord knows, everything that happens
[SPEAKER_00]: to all other industries is going to happen
to cannabis, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, that's one of the things that
makes it so hard here in California is we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't treat it like another crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And farmers have overly restrictive
regulations that they have to follow that
[SPEAKER_00]: make it really hard for them to profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, licensing is really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivation is difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distribution is difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not treated like it is alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was treated like alcohol,
if it was more normalized, like tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: and alcohol, then it would be easier for
farmers, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, let's not, as we transition
out of, you know, cannabis is held hostage
[SPEAKER_00]: and been shackled for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to transition out at
prohibition, but we're still going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, you know, responsible for
correcting the wrongs of society in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of like commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that that's fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I don't have a problem with
people doing CRISPR with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a problem with people doing
gene editing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a problem with people doing
monoculture or whatever, all the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a problem with there not being
really good weed to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's to me, I mean,
ultimately I'm like, look, if you guys can
[SPEAKER_00]: figure this out and make it work,
I mean, you know, I try to eat majority
[SPEAKER_00]: organic produce, you know, and I try to,
you know, be as sustainable as I can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but I'm not holding myself or my
family, you know, responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: correcting agriculture by only eating that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it when I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's just, let's be
realistic about where the industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: headed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just taking a kind of a sober
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, we have a certain
amount of social responsibility to usher
[SPEAKER_00]: in the right, you know, model,
but at the same time, we got to just
[SPEAKER_00]: accept that things are just going to
happen, you know, and not fight that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and that's, I think we have that
resistance built into us because
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition made us so resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like there's this kind of weird
cautious, like just like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are going to screw this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and here in the U S we've got
like farm bill hemp, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we've got the talk about rescheduling
into schedule three, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time, and we've got a
patchwork of regulations that are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: are really onerous from state to state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see why everyone would be really
skeptical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to fuck this up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there's a lot to figure out
before we can move forward here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I know it's the same with
other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia has a lot to figure out in order
to transition out of medical into adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use, you know, other countries that are
still have, you know, cannabis is in full
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a lot to figure out in order
to have an opportunity to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: earn, to make money in this industry as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I think collectively we all
need to, you know, be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: ethical and focused, but also be really
realistic as much as possible when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to like the influence of big
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, given we are sort of standing in
the face of the highly likely impeding
[SPEAKER_01]: federal legalization, what do you think's
going to happen if things continue to roll
[SPEAKER_01]: out the way they are?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think the reclassification to
share schedule three is going to change
[SPEAKER_01]: much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think there was a lot of discussion
about it when it first came out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it seems like it's sort of fallen off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen some people who sort of
aren't convinced it's going to do all that
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, well, having worked quite a bit as
a consultant in Australia, we're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical system where cannabis is
prescribed by a doctor and distributed
[SPEAKER_00]: through a pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be careful what you ask for,
you know, it's not the best system for
[SPEAKER_00]: making cannabis accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and I even think for Australia,
you know, it's great that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical system and it should be even more
robust of a medical system everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be more research and there
should be better medical products for
[SPEAKER_00]: people who really need them for medicinal
and therapeutic needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, cannabis should just
be everywhere for everybody all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so anything that puts
limitations on access, I'm not for that at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that that's good,
you know, but I do think that we do need
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue to move towards medical
medicinal cannabis because I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: we have, we have kind of the same thing
under different classifications versus
[SPEAKER_00]: actual medicinal grade, therapeutic,
you know, safe, you know, safe to consume,
[SPEAKER_00]: addresses, whatever conditions or,
you know, you have like, let's really try
[SPEAKER_00]: to make a schedule three cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question to me is schedule three
only, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is very different than schedule three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, de-schedule out of schedule
one, but don't only put it in schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if it's only in schedule three,
then the idea of it being more accessible
[SPEAKER_00]: at farmers markets or liquor stores or all
that stuff is out the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it becomes similar to possibly
what's going on in Australia, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of accessibility, but through a very
limited channel, you know, and which makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it really hard also for, for cultivation
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it has to be grown and processed and
packaged and distributed as medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: versus produce, which makes it a lot more
expensive for the consumer, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would really hate to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what's so fascinating here in
the U S is that, you know, the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: path for, for being more restricted,
you know, versus this complete opening up
[SPEAKER_00]: this kind of farm gate, open the open farm
bill, open the flood gates for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: nationally, which is what's happened,
which has created this massive,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, farm bill cannabis market,
which now possibly dwarfs the state
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed market has created conflict
between groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and you see now you got in,
in Florida, you've got an incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative governor protecting farm bill
hemp companies, cause it's good for
[SPEAKER_00]: commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in California, you've got
considerably liberal governor protecting
[SPEAKER_00]: state license groups and claiming that
farm bill cannabis is bad for the
[SPEAKER_00]: community and bad for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got Cheech and Chong suing
the California state for making their
[SPEAKER_00]: business, you know, difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, we've got this weird upside
down model where we really don't know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and California being the fifth
largest economy in the world, the world's
[SPEAKER_00]: largest cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like these new restrictions on hemp
derived THC products are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: highlighting the path forward that you
can't have two tracks that are in complete
[SPEAKER_00]: conflict with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't make it really difficult for one
group and completely open for another.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same product that they're
selling, you know, which is kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got THC is everywhere and
it's a loophole and, but it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think free the free the plant,
make, make more loopholes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, you got another
group that's just like, look, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: killing us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We paid a half a million dollars to get
licensed and we're getting taxed like 40%
[SPEAKER_00]: on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, and then meanwhile they're
selling THC flower at the head shop and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, how can that exist?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then California steps in and now is
saying, regardless of federal law,
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless of a 0.3 THC distinction,
we're saying all THC, no matter what
[SPEAKER_00]: potency is now banned in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's weird, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, like if you wanted to like create
some kind of cannabis science fiction from
[SPEAKER_00]: like 40 years ago and say, imagine a world
in the future where a Cheech and Chong is
[SPEAKER_00]: suing the government because they,
I'm like, what in the hell, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets, it gets so bizarre that it's hard
to see a path out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, other than just some gnarly
draconian distinction of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is now what's legal and only this,
because otherwise it's a patchwork of laws
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and support also, you know,
like all these different States have
[SPEAKER_00]: congressional support, the lobbying on
their behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to see their model go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida just got their model.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alabama is just getting their model.
[SPEAKER_00]: New York is starting their model.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to see interstate commerce
just happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then California sells to the whole
country, but every farmer in California
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to be just like every other crop and
say, Hey, the only way we can survive is a
[SPEAKER_00]: garlic or a, or a citrus or a artichoke
farmer is almond farmers to sell our
[SPEAKER_00]: produce to the rest of the country and the
rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's like, it's direct
conflict with like how agriculture works,
[SPEAKER_00]: how regulations work, you know,
what we think cannabis is like chemically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look, definitely some conflicting
messages there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess sad to say someone's going to
end up sort of being the loser.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you said, as, as things get federally
legalized while you were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: that, I couldn't help.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mind was wandering because you were
talking about farm bills and for some
[SPEAKER_01]: reason my mind wandered and I wanted to
ask, cause I saw on your Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: recently, you're at Atlas seeds farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know those guys, they're some pretty
serious auto dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like farmers, farmers,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to ask like, what sort of,
what was the impression that left on you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like do you, as time goes by, I think
autos are going to be adopted more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more on the sort of that agricultural
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your impression from being there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you see autos taking a bigger role
in sort of outdoor cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: bulk scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and those are really, really good
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked with them a little bit,
did some consulting work with them a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago with helping them with their
breeding program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have really, um, ramped things up
and they're really nailing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and autos have come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you think about the challenges
and breeding auto flowers, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the few years we've really seen,
you know, potency and aroma profile and
[SPEAKER_00]: size and everything just really coming
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's definitely, you know,
when you, when you see new markets
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging and scaled, you know,
cultivation, especially for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: API for oil and stuff, auto flowers are
the no brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my only concern about seed companies
and seed production itself is just the
[SPEAKER_00]: scalability of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, we've probably have way more seeds
right now than the earth needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning like there's enough, there's
enough seed producers that have produced
[SPEAKER_00]: enough seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if they could sell all their seed
right now, we could grow way more cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and we could ever consume, you know,
and, and I think that what I guess the
[SPEAKER_00]: message I'm getting there is that that
broad acre cannabis, which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: Australian term, which I really love,
and I hope Americans and other countries
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it really describes what that type
of scaled agriculture is.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say broad acre, it's like,
not just an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not two acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's acres.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hectares.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hundreds of them, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I, when I drive through,
um, like wine country, I can assume I can
[SPEAKER_00]: see like a portion of that vineyard is I
could consume that with my friends and
[SPEAKER_00]: family, like a big lot, a big chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we could all drink for the holidays
and stuff like, but with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: even a big smoker can't really consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big portion of a field.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just not that much cannabis that
needs to be grown to meet the needs of the
[SPEAKER_00]: global consumer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not that many seeds that need
to be produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not that many acres that need
to be sown.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not that many places around the
world that need to grow, that have
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate climate to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I think about all these seed
producers and stuff, they're kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: in this R and D phase of like,
we're going to make all the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make all these varieties
and we're going to sell them to all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different people all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to figure out what works
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rules are going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to grow only where it
really works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we'll do this all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a whole new exercise in like
producing seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause right now, for instance,
you know, like I know guys in Minnesota
[SPEAKER_00]: that are growing acres and acres of
autoflowers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they wouldn't be growing acres of
autoflowers in Minnesota if you could
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase flower from California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just cheaper and better quality and
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to, you know, same thing with
Northern areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're, and they're going through
pathogen trials to kind of figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: is less susceptible to patterned mildew or
susceptible to leaf spot septoria or stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, you know, and then the breeders
are responding, well, try this and do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, ultimately, if you're a
seed producer for other crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow for the, you produce seeds for
the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's ideal for growing that crop.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like right now we, excuse me,
because of, you know, because of,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the federal regulations,
we can't just grow cannabis where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: most appropriate to grow it and distribute
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead we're selling the seeds and the
clones to places where they're growing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it's not the right place to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's hard on the seed producers to
now like, okay, I've got to, I've got to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to produce seeds for people to
grow at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Vermont and New York and South Dakota
and Southern California, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these different places where,
I mean, how much of your focus would be on
[SPEAKER_00]: that if we had a real thriving market,
you know, and that's, I guess,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is not, not anything to say about
Atlas seeds or any one seed company,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's just about breeding and
improving, you know, variety improvement
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to move from forward with your
breeding goals is all about the downstream
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer, you know, the farmer that's
going to sow those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now it's just a scramble to
produce seed for people all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, you know, and, and, you know,
a really interesting, like where,
[SPEAKER_00]: what Atlas is doing, that's really far
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think compelling and interesting,
you know, if I already said that is the
[SPEAKER_00]: work in Morocco, because here's a place
where they really do grow broad acre
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and they really do, you know,
homogenize and produce like this big bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: product for large scale export,
but it's not, it's not there yet because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still under, you know, it's still
under prohibition influence, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Morocco doesn't have a fully mature system
yet, but they've got a fully mature and
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning hashish culture and market for
decades, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So auto flowers and feminized seeds first
really fit in there right away,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but I mean, then, then we could
go down a whole, another rabbit hole on
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, well should have Moroccan
genetics stayed Moroccan instead of being
[SPEAKER_00]: influenced by California, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like seed producers producing
seeds for where, for what product?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a big, it's a big question,
you know, and there's a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've just heard stories about like
the volume of seeds that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: produced in the past couple of years by
all of these different groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to make seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relatively easy to make seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to sell seed, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can only imagine how much seed has
been produced in recent years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to forgive me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep pulling us off track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take me back to when you were talking
about the transition back from Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_01]: to America in the wake of prop two 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that move back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what did you take with you and what
did you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you sort of was setting yourself
back up?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first came back, I just came back
with some seeds and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back, I wish I had kept that
female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one thing I regret.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back with seeds and I had spent,
I got really into hashish when I was in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam and learning how to make
hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another thing that, you know,
I had this, this passion for making hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was great knowing Rob, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got really into that and I realized
that I had a couple ideas of product ideas
[SPEAKER_00]: that I tried to make some of that one that
actually got kind of ripped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called the hash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little handheld shaker thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone ended up making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still sell them today actually,
but it was a totally different design,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they kind of ripped off by idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a couple other little ideas for
like little hash boxes and just sieving
[SPEAKER_00]: gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like when I first saw, I saw the four
bubble bags and Mila had made her isolator
[SPEAKER_00]: bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw that first hash making device
from, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Reinhardt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went home that night and made like
my own little water hash thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, dude, this is,
this is like game changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew from experience in the
community back in Cali that everyone was
[SPEAKER_00]: just throwing away their trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they were trimming for one,
they should have been trimming over
[SPEAKER_00]: screens because they trim fully dry
material, you know, and the resin would
[SPEAKER_00]: just fly through the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember just seeing like clouds of
resin with the sun rays shining through
[SPEAKER_00]: the dappled leaves and just resin flying
everywhere and going, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would see these trash bags full of
trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes he's like, yeah,
maybe I'm gonna sell it to someone who'll
[SPEAKER_00]: make brownies or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, dude, there is gold in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually didn't even buy bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if they're for sale,
but I just knew of a print supply place
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got loads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get bulk, bulk silkscreen and I
would stretch my own flat screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd make, I'd stitch my own bags,
went up to Big Sur and was making bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: hash and just kind of splitting it with
the farmer and doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had met in Amsterdam before I came
back to Cali, I had met a friend who was
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies with Josh D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in like 98 or late 97, maybe early
98, I had met Josh here in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right when I came back, the Kush thing
was just taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was kind of in with those guys,
hanging out with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I had met the sour guys,
sour diesel guys in Amsterdam years before
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I came back to Cali and I wasn't
growing, but I was in these two circles of
[SPEAKER_00]: sour diesel and OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of flower going around
and I was kind of facilitating some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that and trying to be a bridge,
I guess in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so it took me a while to get back
into growing and breeding probably about
[SPEAKER_00]: two years before I started doing that
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, when you first got exposed to
OG and to sour, was it immediately evident
[SPEAKER_01]: to you like, oh wow, this is the next
thing or did it grow on you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And did you immediately want to breed with
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first the sour I first saw in
Amsterdam because those guys came over
[SPEAKER_00]: right after they had popped the beans and
showed the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was definitely, it was super
impressive, super loud aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to, you know, I'd set up a grow
for them in Amsterdam in around 96 that
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up getting seized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I knew there was something special
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just the really intense loud aroma
profile to me was the main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similar with OG, cause both to be
perfectly honest, the effect from both of
[SPEAKER_00]: those cultivars does not particularly
resonate with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was always like this just intense
loud aroma profile and it wasn't about
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was always strange, you know,
but I knew that there was something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, alluring about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also just the reason I decided to
start breeding with OG was just that
[SPEAKER_00]: swollen bract kind of structure and that
frostiness was something that I just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of wanted to bring into sage just to chunk
it up a little bit and to bring the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: time down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, it was interesting because for
one, those two groups, sour and OG,
[SPEAKER_00]: they both had this weight behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already, even they were just young guys
and just getting growing and not producing
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot at the time when I met them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like clear that there was
something bigger than, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the sum of the parts was bigger kind of
thing because OG and sour diesel were just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't know, something about that
loud aroma profile, which I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting because I think aroma
and the advertising nature of just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: these new gassy varieties really took over
cannabis in terms of like what people
[SPEAKER_00]: expected it to be when they got that in
their catalog, you know, and it just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really crept into the gene pool and it
pushed everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was trippy for me because I didn't
particularly like smoking them that much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I saw how huge of a demand there was
in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also saw how people reacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting because when you
think about, not that the effect of both
[SPEAKER_00]: of those plants isn't special and unique
on its own, but when you think about how
[SPEAKER_00]: we talked about all the difference in wine
and what makes a $50 bottle or a $5 bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: is just the aroma and flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the ethanol.
[SPEAKER_00]: With sour and OG, that's when I found that
I first started seeing people's eyes light
[SPEAKER_00]: up when they'd smell it and they'd go,
Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their eyes would light up and their
jaw would drop because it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they hadn't even smoked it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like this incredibly
compelling, like, Oh my God, I didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: weed could smell that way thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that I think started driving the
selection, not just from the consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the breeder, the grower, everybody was
this new wave of aroma, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just keeps going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, like to me, nowadays,
when people talk about weed, they just
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about flavors and smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't talk about how it makes them
feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even a drug anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we're like our endocannabinoid
system is so maxed out maybe that the only
[SPEAKER_00]: thing we can talk about is the way it
smells because it's hard to feel the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect because our tolerance is so high,
but it really has become the discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was a kid and all the way
through Amsterdam, even that wasn't the
[SPEAKER_00]: main driver of the selling point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like candy or things that have
flavor or carbohydrates were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is all about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when those two cuts entered the pool,
it just became about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, dude, and that's when loud,
that whole concept of loud, it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it's like a neon sign saying,
come try me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether you even like the high or even
feel the high is probably even not even
[SPEAKER_00]: fully relevant because the aroma was so
intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder what, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think about that aroma?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so alluring because like,
I mean, it's, it's often described as like
[SPEAKER_01]: fuely piney sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while yes, it's broadly palatable,
it's not like an offensive smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess maybe a better way to articulate
what I'm thinking is, is that I know that
[SPEAKER_01]: we were, we were talking off camera the
other day and we were saying like,
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of all comes from the chem and the,
and the kush is in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess with the chem, there are some
people who find the flavor profile a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: off putting, whereas with the kush,
it's pretty universally enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder, I wonder what does that exactly?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, is it just as simple as the
terpene profile?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you think it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think there's like some other
sort of stuff going on under the hood?
[SPEAKER_01]: That we're maybe not aware of yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the, I think the,
well, I think I try to, I try to lean
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the word aroma more because now
we're finding out all the stuff about
[SPEAKER_00]: thiols and indoles and you know,
esters and ketones and pyrazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just so many different things
in cannabis that contribute to the aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't really know what plays a role
in terms of effect, in terms of entourage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's, I think it's, we have to look,
look at it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that we over, we underestimate
the power of aroma and flavor in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: decision-making and in terms of like aroma
and flavor trigger a different response in
[SPEAKER_00]: our brain, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like about mom, it's about safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about like, is this good or not to
consume?
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about, you know, all these things
that are like bigger than a drug,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and you think about all our
decision-making we make in life for
[SPEAKER_00]: products and how aroma dictates that and
the food we eat and the perfume that we
[SPEAKER_00]: wear and the shampoo that we put on our
head and the products we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a really powerful tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, to some degree, all cannabis is
good enough for everybody, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if we just had, if we were just stuck
with Blue Dream, it would probably be fine
[SPEAKER_00]: for everybody, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea that these other things came
around that had just this huge like
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising signal to the world around
them that I am here, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: see me, smell me, touch me, smoke me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really just draws people in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I would see like with
OG and Sour was the first time I'd see
[SPEAKER_00]: people when they take a hit and they'd
smack their lips afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go like that, like they were chewing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, think about all the
different parts of your brain that are
[SPEAKER_00]: firing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just like taking a substance and
waiting for the effect, like eating an
[SPEAKER_00]: aspirin and waiting for the pain to go
away or, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're engaged now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like you're in the bubble
of experience because you're chewing,
[SPEAKER_00]: smelling, tasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you are in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was very new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we didn't have that experience
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these cultivars came on the scene the
same time indoor cultivation came on the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene, the same time the proliferation of
like medical and like dispensaries came on
[SPEAKER_00]: the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like cannabis went from this dirty,
old, you know, dried out, vapid,
[SPEAKER_00]: lifeless thing to this extremely loud,
fresh in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your face, you know, neon, loud
cannabis profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really just, it just took over the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's, we're still there
where, you know, now people really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're not seeking out,
they're not seeking out sativas for that
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, for instance, that are they
delivering the loud, that spicy,
[SPEAKER_00]: that spicy, herbaceous, woodsy insect
since sativa thing doesn't really fire up
[SPEAKER_00]: the same part of your brain is that
fruity, tropical, skunky, dank,
[SPEAKER_00]: intense fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, that just, that's like,
and I, I mean, I just heard a breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: today talking about all his breeding
selections and what he's doing and where's
[SPEAKER_00]: he's crossing and where he's headed and
what he wants to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the entire conversation was just about
aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, there was never a like,
oh, yeah, but this one's like susceptible
[SPEAKER_00]: to powdery mildew or, oh yeah,
this one doesn't really get you high that
[SPEAKER_00]: nice or, oh yeah, this one yields really
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, dude, aroma takes,
and, and, and to me that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love good flavored cannabis and all
cannabis should be great flavor if it
[SPEAKER_00]: could, but what the difference is,
is it puts the effect in the backseat and
[SPEAKER_00]: the aroma starts driving the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and this is my, I'll say it again,
and this is like, I'm just being cheeky by
[SPEAKER_00]: saying it, but there's something somewhat
reckless about marketing drugs with
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just joking, but I'm also serious,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's like, if you thought about
like, like if I had like, and I've done
[SPEAKER_00]: this before when my back was out and I'd
like, I'd take some ibuprofen and I chew
[SPEAKER_00]: it because if you chew up a pill,
it works way faster, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it tastes like shit and it's really
bitter in your mouth and ugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll happily chew the bitter pill if I
get the effect that I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, if Sativas have to be less loud
and less aromatic and less whatever in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to give me that soaring,
beautiful, you know, resonant high,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'm going to do that all day long
versus the things that just taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people give them to me all the time,
a weed that just tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Jesus, this is so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish it had the effect that I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I learned years ago is that
usually as a breeder, when you select
[SPEAKER_00]: those aromas, it often cancels out the
thing that you want because it's all tied
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was my experience with making OG
sage crosses is that anything that had OG
[SPEAKER_00]: nose had no sage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh shit, I love the way
this smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's going to love it, but it
doesn't deliver the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just kick those to the curb and
just destroy them because OG was already
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour was already out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was already plenty of really loud
dynamic smelling weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted that sage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever that entourage thing is,
or whatever that blocking effect is,
[SPEAKER_00]: or that sealing thing, whatever,
if I selected OG, it came with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and that was, you know,
pre really understanding the entourage
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I kind of realized like,
man, and like, like grape is a perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to like, I love grape flavored
things, but grape flavored weed doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to like, go like, shit,
I love grape, but I can't love grape weed
[SPEAKER_00]: because grape weed has an effect generally
that I don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, we got to like be responsible
about like, what are we really trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is it, are we selling lollipops
and candy and dessert items that have a
[SPEAKER_00]: drug back to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are we selling a drug that has these
aroma backs to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what is in the driving seat?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, to me, the early, you know,
grow books and stuff, they'd always talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about these sativas and put them up on a
pedestal as the finest weed in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it never said, because it tastes
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, that just wasn't a part of the
discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, no, man, this is,
I mean, cannabis is a drug, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least that part of it is a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in a way, because of,
you know, the way consumerism works,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I understand that if you have one
variety that tastes good and one that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't, people will generally choose the
one that tastes good, regardless of the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just, but that to me is
about this, like, what are we choosing
[SPEAKER_00]: for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what, you know,
and just even on the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the data around like the effects
of linalool or the effects of pineene or
[SPEAKER_00]: the effects of these things come from like
aromatherapy world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is good solid data that just
these smells alone create a endogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: response from the consumer, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that is just the entourage
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about binding to receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about making you feel good and then
consuming the drug that also makes you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aroma is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get that, but like, and there's
groups like abstracts, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: who've done all this amazing research on
like, you know, these other aromatic
[SPEAKER_00]: components, like, you know, Tropicana,
Sulfurs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, at some point I'd like to
imagine we'll figure out which one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things are contributing to an
entourage or an ensemble effect and which
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them are just things that smell
good or interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can start like saying like,
okay, I want weed that does this in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of effect, but has this flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my experience breeding has been that
if you go that route, then you can't just
[SPEAKER_00]: layer effect on top of, I mean,
layer flavor on top of effect without
[SPEAKER_00]: jeopardizing the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, that's why I've just stuck
to one lane for 30 years now, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: turpinoline dominant sage cultivars has
been what I've been breeding for solely,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, no matter what goes into it,
the thing that comes out of it is that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm trying to do, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if it doesn't taste that good,
which it doesn't to a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause sage is like, you know, it's like a
cooking herb versus a dessert topping,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, that is where the magic is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've tried the other crosses that I've
made that were more limonene dominant that
[SPEAKER_00]: had more Kim dog, you know, upfront,
and you just lose the nuance of the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm overly convicted to staying in that
lane, regardless of whether or not it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a more sellable product,
but that's also because sage works for me
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's my, you know, it's like my
medicine, so I don't want to screw it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I love that so much weight to sticking
to your own lane, but also to,
[SPEAKER_01]: as you said, you know, these things,
they're not, they're not just easily
[SPEAKER_01]: switched up as sad as it is to say,
we probably never going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke some, uh, some tie that tastes like
kush mints.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still, it still feels like tie,
you know, but let's, let's rewind back a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I wanted to ask you, what was the
progression from sort of being involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: the early kush scene to linking up with
Rob and really getting your feet wet in
[SPEAKER_01]: the legal world via, you know,
starting the consulting work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what was that transition like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, when I first came back to Cali
and, um, I started, you know, making water
[SPEAKER_00]: hash and connecting with local growers and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, prop two 15 was just getting rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people were basically growing,
um, with a medical card that gave them a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of, you know, um,
comfort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then slowly dispensaries were popping
up and as dispensaries popped up,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I started working with dispensaries to
basically design their hydro facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: their indoor facilities and provide them
with, um, genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked with a few here in LA for
quite a few years, training their staff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, being their director of
cultivation, um, doing a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and selection and got kind of a
rep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, locally I developed a plant,
which was a 75% Sage, 25% OG called Zeta
[SPEAKER_00]: and Zeta was really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amongst some of the high end dispensaries
in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, at one point it was the most
expensive flower sold in the County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just decided after working with,
um, after working with dispensaries for
[SPEAKER_00]: awhile and stuff, I decided just to keep
it small and produce boutique high end,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, small scale flower and stay in my lane
and, um, continue doing that up until
[SPEAKER_00]: around 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by then you could just feel,
um, you could feel prohibition was fading
[SPEAKER_00]: away and that there was a transition that
was about to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I knew you were, I was already
working, you know, I've been on a,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on advisory board with the,
uh, national Institute of drug abuse study
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Los Angeles since 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I got to see kind of the other side
of the fence talking about cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at legalization started,
you know, talking about talking with
[SPEAKER_00]: people, the drug policy Alliance,
um, had friends that were in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: who owned companies who are lobbying with
the state and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could really see the writing on
the wall that we're moving towards,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, an adult use market and that there was
going to be a vote soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so by 2015, I had started,
um, bio ergonomics group consulting with
[SPEAKER_00]: Rob and Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, we saw that, you know,
there was a big transition that was about
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to provide the kind of big
picture cannabis side because everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: so focused on, you know, the market,
you know, we wanted to be the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of cannabis side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so for the first couple of years,
we just kind of, we had a company and we
[SPEAKER_00]: were just talking to people, kind of
seeing how things were going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I just decided to stop
cultivating all together and focus a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred percent on consulting in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started working, you know,
with the goals of kind of what we were
[SPEAKER_00]: working internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started working in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some groups licensed there and also
worked on license applications and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that throughout the U S a bunch of
different States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just decided that, you know,
we could add a kind of an ethnobotanical
[SPEAKER_00]: big picture approach to cannabis for all
these emerging companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've, we've had, um,
we've got to work with a lot of really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool groups and continue to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I still think people kind of overlook
the big picture more than they should,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're also focused on making
money and quick returns, um, that they
[SPEAKER_00]: often don't see, you know, that this is a
big, it's an arc that we're going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're slowly transitioning out
of prohibition and all these models will
[SPEAKER_00]: be changing over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what we wanted to do is
just add like these perspectives that were
[SPEAKER_00]: often, there's a lot of great cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's great breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's great HVAC engineers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's great people who do all the very
specific things, but sometimes the right
[SPEAKER_00]: hand doesn't talk to the left or the CEO
doesn't, or the CFO specifically doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: speak the same language as the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so we wanted to be that bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's worked really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's been, that's been kind of
what, what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yeah, so I've been solely a
consultant for quite some time and
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to breed and continue to work
with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still I'm in California, so I'm,
I, we haven't worked, um, really in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, um, in terms of like
consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done some licensing stuff,
um, here, but my community and my family's
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, my, my narrative is still
very much about the California narrative,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's kind of weird because for the
past eight years or so, I've really worked
[SPEAKER_00]: in other States and other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but always, you know, it always comes
back here, you know, to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, it's, uh, like I said,
it's been a real pleasure working with Rob
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also, you know, when we started by
aeronomics group and started consulting,
[SPEAKER_00]: we also started writing for cannabis
business times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a column called,
um, growing pains where we've written a
[SPEAKER_00]: good couple of dozen articles,
kind of highlighting this transition and a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit common themes that we talk about are,
um, you know, transitioning to
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture, uh, land race, cannabis,
um, hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done a lot of quite a few articles
on the kind of the relationship between,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, cannabis and hops in terms of,
um, you know, their, their genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship, but also the, the
relationships of the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the branding, the chemistry, the aroma,
um, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very fascinated in that kind of
co-relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, no, it's, it's,
it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like, you know, as someone early on,
I've, I came from, um, from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, you know, from the grassroots,
side and, um, we were back to the land,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hippies and, you know,
lived in my early years off the grid,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with no power and no running
water sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over the years I've been fascinated
more and more by science and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: science kind of drives my opinions in
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a formal education in any
way, shape or form, but I've had the
[SPEAKER_00]: privilege to work alongside people like
Rob, who are very much focused on you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, using science as a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been kind of my, um, how science
and the plant, they kind of, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: intertwined for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, it's a big part of, um,
my perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yeah, so that's, that's,
yeah, that's been the main thing with
[SPEAKER_00]: Bioergonomics Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've have been, you know, just trying to,
to, to be a bridge on, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant science and the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's so awesome to hear you,
you touched on like four or five things
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to loop back to,
cause there's so much good details in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the first thing that I wanted to
quickly ask you before we move on is as I
[SPEAKER_01]: was writing these questions, at some point
I wondered, I wonder what an average day
[SPEAKER_01]: for you looks like in your work,
you know, like, is it, I'm sure there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: mixture, like as much as everyone might
dream that you're sort of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Indiana Jones at facilities,
like with a machete, like hacking through
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure there's other facets to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How, how would you describe your work?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, is it a mixture of like
theoretical and meetings and some
[SPEAKER_01]: practical work, or what's the division of
labor like between you and Rob?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you together most of the time you sort
of tackling projects individually,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you collaborate sort of
afterwards and bounce ideas off each
[SPEAKER_01]: other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, I have to say, unfortunately I'd
love to, I do have a really cool Indiana
[SPEAKER_00]: Jones hat and I'd love to be, um,
running through fields more than I do,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I spend way too much time,
way more time than I'd like in front of a
[SPEAKER_00]: laptop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as, uh, you know, as in the new modern
world, that's the way we interface with
[SPEAKER_00]: our clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rob has been living in Sweden for the
past few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we generally in the morning we wake up
and, you know, I, my morning, his late
[SPEAKER_00]: afternoon, early evening, we chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a while, um, we do lots of zoom,
far too many zoom calls and lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: different, um, time zones around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always a challenge trying to,
you know, decide who gets to wake up at 6
[SPEAKER_00]: AM and who, or who has to take a call at
11 PM and try to be sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do, I had, I've had clients,
I had a client in Minnesota for a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of years, and that was more of an onsite,
um, role where I'd be there probably about
[SPEAKER_00]: a week out of every month, just,
you know, helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the facility design and hiring staff
and training staff and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but for the most part, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do, I do a lot of, and I still,
um, spend a good amount of time here in
[SPEAKER_00]: California with the community here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have relationships with different
groups, like we do with the guys at Hayes
[SPEAKER_00]: Valley in Watsonville who are running
those trials for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm frequently up there, um,
checking things out with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to visit as many farms as
possible just to keep my hands on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I have a catalog of plants that I
have to manage myself, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging because I try to keep as many
things alive as possible without over,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, like my, I still have a 30
year old sage cultivar that I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: flowered it in years, but I just keep it
alive and veg over and over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got about 15 to 18 different,
um, cultivars that I'm perpetually vegging
[SPEAKER_00]: just back to that whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guy, like I don't do it for my consulting
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do it as a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just do it as a passion and because I
love plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I should say, actually that's not
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those, a couple of those plants
are, um, we actually, one thing that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have done over the past few years is we've
got a, um, a United States plant patent on
[SPEAKER_00]: one cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which is interesting because we also
work with a group called breeders best,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a plant IP company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, run by Dale Hunt, who's an amazing
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so we have a plant patent and we
also have a UPOF plant patent,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, which is more of an international
plant variety protection system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been dabbling a little bit in
that in trying to, in plant licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting full protection for a plant,
not just a hypothetical protection,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like full legal plant protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, one of those varieties has been
in production with Sagra.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tissue culture and distribution
company in Canada, and they sell and
[SPEAKER_00]: license that variety in multiple countries
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of an exercise of like,
you know, breed a plant, bring it to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, breed a plant, get IP on that
plant, bring it to the international
[SPEAKER_00]: market, distribute that plant,
cultivate it around the world kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a back to that exercise of like,
what would ag do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what, how do you treat other plants
if you want to treat cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: That we treat apples or grapes or tomatoes
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I mean, while we're on the topic
of patent patents quickly, what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you think will be the future of
patents in the sort of global cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I, I won, I guess the only thing I
really wonder about is obviously what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're describing is like, you can
completely understand why it's being used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sometimes people get very worried
about this idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like someone is somehow able to patent
some very foundational genetic breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: block.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's like flow on
repercussions for like all other genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: or something to that effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any concerns about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think that's like, it's not a
reality?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's totally a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not concerned about it in terms of how
it's going to impact the gene pool as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as how it could impact the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the difference between an
individual plant patent and a utility
[SPEAKER_00]: patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: An individual plant patent is a patent on
one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one piece of art.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't overlap into anybody else's
plants and their plants don't overlap into
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this plant is my plant that I created
and it's unique and novel because of X,
[SPEAKER_00]: Y, and Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very different and it doesn't have
a lot of power to, you know, but a utility
[SPEAKER_00]: patent, utility patents can be quite
broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could in theory create utility
patents that and some have questioned some
[SPEAKER_00]: in previous patents that could be broad
enough to, you know, impinge on other
[SPEAKER_00]: people's prior art or what they might
assume is prior art.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are two really big differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the main thing that
people need to understand is that one is
[SPEAKER_00]: about just an individual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally holding a clone and saying,
I'm just telling the world this is mine
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm the only one who made it and I'm
the only one who can have it unless I
[SPEAKER_00]: agree to share it with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very simple kind of just legal
protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utility patents are, think of it more of
as a class with overlapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have patented things that have these
attributes, whether it's the chemistry or
[SPEAKER_00]: the morphology or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that could be interpreted far
more broad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an individual plant patent is just an
individual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, in terms of patents,
they're valuable, but it comes back to
[SPEAKER_00]: this diversity in the supply chain thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only as valuable as they are,
for one, enforceable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they're only valuable if they
occupy a portion of the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you have a patent on cotton candy
grapes and cotton candy grapes are 10% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the market, then you have a really
powerful tool there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a patent on a plant that
only has a thousandth of a thousandth of a
[SPEAKER_00]: percent of the market, whether it's
patented or not is kind of irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, patents are valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they're good tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, IP is important, but it's not the
same as other crops just because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sheer numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the real thing that makes patents less
valuable or less utility is that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a trademarkable name to attach to
that patent application or that patent
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I breed Honeycrisp apples,
but it's just a patent X1 3251,
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't have any bearing in commerce,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honeycrisp is the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Honeycrisp, the trademark is what has
the value.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trademark attached to a patent is the
defendable thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now in the U.S., anybody can call
any plant anything they want, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: patented or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyone who has Kim can call it Kim
gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can call it gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing that anybody can do about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that creates the conflict and that
creates the noise and that creates the
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistency and really screws the
consumer, obviously, because they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a Honeycrisp apple when they buy
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could be getting something totally
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the kind of weird part that
we're in where the USPTO will acknowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: the patent, but the trademark office won't
give a name to that patent, which gives it
[SPEAKER_00]: a life in commerce because trademarks only
work for interstate commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trademark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a weird space to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you flash back 30 years and say,
well, what if Kim dog was a patented plant
[SPEAKER_00]: with a trademark name and OG Kush was a
patented plant with a trademark name,
[SPEAKER_00]: those two clones only or Sour Diesel or
Blue Dream or whatever, all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, those are all multibillion dollar
plants in terms of their value and what
[SPEAKER_00]: they've brought to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does someone deserve to own it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what you consider deserves
or owns or what.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as IP works, if you planted,
if you took the seed and it was your seed
[SPEAKER_00]: and you put it in the ground and it made a
new plant, then that's your new plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it just like all the other
tools in ag, it deserves to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it isn't necessarily what people think
it is or doesn't necessarily have the
[SPEAKER_00]: utility that people think it might have or
could.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just different than other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's just thousands and
thousands of cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are, I mean, there are,
I mean, there's look at look at lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry gelato, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these are these are these are new
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had they been patented, had they been
trademarked, they would be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd be the varieties that the
Monsanto's would be trying to turn into,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the new, you know, Red
Delicious, because they can protect it and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can own it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we still have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A long, long way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's that's reassuring to hear
that really like, you know, it's just for
[SPEAKER_01]: individual strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we jumped into that one,
you mentioned that, you know, you'd done
[SPEAKER_01]: some writing for Cannabis Business Times
and there's a plethora of incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: articles on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think there was like 60 plus or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge amount of awesome information there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you touched on, there was some cool
ones you'd written about hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to ask you, what do you think are
some of maybe the similarities that people
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't aware of between like, obviously
they're related, but in what ways are they
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of more similar than different?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there any tech that gets used in
the hop industry that might make its way
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabis in your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're really similar in that
they're both cannabis, they're related and
[SPEAKER_00]: likely came from, you know, the same
ancestor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a very similar aroma
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the dominant, I mean,
Mircine, Caryophylline and Humuline are
[SPEAKER_00]: the three dominant terpenes in hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Caryophylline and Mircine are
definitely like ubiquitous in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oddly enough, the two that seem to
have some type of receptor affinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other than that, they're not that
similar, you know, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hops is a perennial and it doesn't have
all these drugs, but the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they both have, they both create,
they have glands that produce active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found this interesting relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for one, it was, one of our
discussions was just on like, I'm always
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinated with the chemical similarities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but also the branding similarities
and the co-relationship between,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, California craft beer and
California cannabis, I think is an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting story and we could go deep
dive into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll tell you one thing that was
fascinating early on reading this book,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's called For the Love of Hops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We realized that there's just a wealth of
research that's been done on hops aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: because they can for years and they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we saw in this one book that hops have
thiols, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wrote in like 2018, we broke just
kind of in passing this kind of a cute
[SPEAKER_00]: little thing about, oh, you know,
the thing that makes hops skunky with
[SPEAKER_00]: thiols.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no one had identified that in cannabis
yet because no one had done the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was kind of like, we were just
trying to draw these comparisons of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, if it's in this plant, maybe it's in
this plant too, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and I think that's really
interesting because we don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and we don't know what,
you know, like for instance, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: people still talk about like eating
mangoes and black pepper and attenuating
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, modulating the effects of
THC and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And modern beer IPA movement definitely
turned up the volume on aroma and flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with dry hopping and these new
IPAs and hazies where all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting all of these new notes in
beer that weren't there before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to cannabis right at the same time
when fresh cannabis is a new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these dank notes and these like kind
of skunky notes that the beer industry
[SPEAKER_00]: starts kind of changing and championing
this kind of relationship with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: saying like, no, it's actually kind of
cool that it smells like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then little nods in that direction on
the marketing and branding on the packages
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, there's a brand called
Bubble Stash, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and then Yakima Chief Hops
is like doing Cryo hops, which is like
[SPEAKER_00]: their freeze dry Cryo keef type thing,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like there's a lot of, you know,
and the whole IPA world here in California
[SPEAKER_00]: from Sierra Nevada Brewery really started
with Anchor Steam and then like Sierra
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada and then Laganitas, these big
brands that started, they were all
[SPEAKER_00]: drenched in cannabis culture and growing
regions and, you know, the Sierra Nevada
[SPEAKER_00]: foothills and Marin County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, it's been a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's been a story of this kind of
emerging new craft beer world and this new
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging cannabis thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you see companies like
Abstracts getting so deep into the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between these aroma profiles
and how they, you know, they don't just
[SPEAKER_00]: share in the formulation, but they share
in the marketing and the culture and the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's plant geek stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like plant geek in your can,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when did, like when did, like I love
when I buy a beer now and it talks about
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants that are in the can,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got like four different hop varietals
on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like saying, you know, what hop
varieties they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, dude, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's not just weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just beer, you know, it's plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cool that they evolved together,
you know, and then they diverged to become
[SPEAKER_00]: these, you know, most common, you know,
enjoyed substances, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just an interesting relationship
that we've liked exploring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I enjoy a good beer and I enjoy a good
joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go well together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, amen to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we're on sort of the topic of
aromas in general, you know, another
[SPEAKER_01]: article that I saw from you guys was sort
of talking about the volatile and somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: caustic nature of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was one that resonated with me
because I think back many years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked as a chemist for a little bit and
I saw terpenes used as like solvents in
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think most people have seen that,
you know, they can eat through rubber to a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I want to know, you know,
without trying to be too hyperbolic and
[SPEAKER_01]: too tongue in cheek, you know,
are we subtly killing ourselves for the
[SPEAKER_01]: terp drip?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Rob always says not all terpenes are
good terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, we don't know what contributes
to the effect and what's just a good
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen, I mean, you can drop a
rubber band in an ounce of weed and
[SPEAKER_00]: certain varieties will eat that rubber
band in like a few weeks and it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: crackled and funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really don't have, you know,
we have anecdotal information that says
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is safe to consume for a long,
long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't been consumed consuming it
this way and this terpy and whatever all
[SPEAKER_00]: the other things are, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the fresh volumes of fresh,
you know, rosin and BHO and there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's terpy weed feels different on your
lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash cultures volatilize those terps so
heavily before it was consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I remember hearing stories about
when they switched to modern seed in
[SPEAKER_00]: Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're exporting bricks of hash in
the ship holes and they would hear this
[SPEAKER_00]: explode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go down the hole and the bags were
exploding under pressure because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed airtight and the terps are off
gassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like popping, you know,
because no one's done this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a new area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't not to, you know, not to be a
skeptic or raise caution so much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just all agree that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amount, you know, and then people
are, you know, adding terps and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's botanical terps and
there's just sprayed on weed and all this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's new grounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am sometimes cautious about,
you know, whether or not we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming so much terpenes and what effect
it does have on our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not too worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to stop me from consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do just think it's always,
you know, the devil's in the details and
[SPEAKER_00]: we should always look really careful into
public safety stuff and not just assume
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, we've done it in the
past that the way we do it in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: is the right way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, but also just, it just
comes down back to that solventy thing of
[SPEAKER_00]: like terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, when people started
like consuming masses amount of terps,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, there was a little bit of a
solvent huffing kind of weird thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: like are we just kind of huffing things?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and I'm not a big dabber.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't dab a lot, but I know that when I
do dab, I feel it in my lungs in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: different way than dry flower smoke or
hash smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a different feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know limonene, you know,
just as a solvent is just really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do remember when they first,
I had some friends that were that the
[SPEAKER_00]: workshop when they first did the
[SPEAKER_00]: first distillate in California,
when they first started making distillate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 10 years or so ago, 10,
11 years ago, and the first vape pens that
[SPEAKER_00]: were made using distillate and botanical
terps, I was a total guinea pig where
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd make up all kinds of different
batches and like, here, try this one,
[SPEAKER_00]: try that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you, some of them were like
caustic and dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, dude, don't do that to me
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like just really like,
whoa, man, you know, because we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we didn't know what the safe limits
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some, I remember at one time,
one group had these pens that were,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were like 80% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just realized they could
just keep cutting it down with more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more terps to the point where it was
majority terps and minority THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like, you wouldn't see that
today, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were doing it just because they
could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were still getting high enough
off of a vape pen that was only 40,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% THC, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rest was just all this heavy duty
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, dude, so now you really
are like, we're huffing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's crazy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, gosh, it's, it's something I don't
want to explore, but you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those early days and,
and, you know, we all collectively cringe
[SPEAKER_01]: at the, the questionable dab we've done of
butane soup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we've all got a few regrets
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to touch on something that you
mentioned a bit earlier, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you touched on so many good points,
like a few points back that we just got to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep looping back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned Breeders Best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know too much about this until I
started doing some preparation for our
[SPEAKER_01]: chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you really need to,
to give us the low down, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it seems like a cool initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you explain Breeders Best for
anyone who's not familiar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Breeders Best is a company founded
by Dale Hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dale Hunt is an IP attorney, but he's also
a plant scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had the idea that you could create
IP for plants in a way similar to other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops, because he's worked with other
crops for a lot of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also work with Dr. Ethan Russo and
Nisha Whiteley and Rob Clark and a few
[SPEAKER_00]: others over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we basically started just looking at a
lot of different unique cannabis cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: that had unique properties, mostly,
you know, a lot of like minor cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seeing that if there was like the
opportunity to create IP and create these
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with farmers and help them
get licensing agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been an interesting journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the challenges around IP are kind of
like kind of what I highlighted earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard to create market dynamics or
market, you know, to penetrate the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard for growers, any growers with
any cultivars, but some of these guys have
[SPEAKER_00]: developed some amazing genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess the one group that I would
highlight that we've worked with at
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders Best is Emerald Spirit Botanicals
who have THCV cultivars that they
[SPEAKER_00]: developed, which are pretty amazing and
have won loads of awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Cups and California State Fair
Cups and just have had a huge response
[SPEAKER_00]: from consumers and are truly something new
and different that deserve to have all the
[SPEAKER_00]: protections that another plant would have
in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so we basically, you know,
acquire IP for groups and help them enter
[SPEAKER_00]: license agreements and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, working with Dale and
working with Ethan and working with Rob,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been really, really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big, big, big brand guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I took a look through the site,
the catalog of some of the strains on
[SPEAKER_01]: there that are offered, it's really
unique, you know, some of your work
[SPEAKER_01]: popping its head up in amongst it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear what some of the cool
stuff in there that maybe is a bit off the
[SPEAKER_01]: beaten track, people less familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, the Pink Blues got us for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, there's a Oaxacan Wise,
which is also a Turpinoline dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: variety, but it's also high in CBG.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Ethan has always been,
you know, trying to get people to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bigger picture of cannabis and also
help to find those, like create those
[SPEAKER_00]: lanes for consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And THCV has been one of them and CBG
lately has been a big, he's done some
[SPEAKER_00]: double blind studies on CBG efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's kind of weird,
maybe because of CBD, like CBD created
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole new world, but then it didn't
really succeed as much as it could have or
[SPEAKER_00]: should have in the market and kind of
tanked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went from, you know, an $80,000 kilo
THC isolate down to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: $250 or whatever it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these other minor cannabinoids,
you know, they have a role, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG, THCV, CBN, CBC, all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, once we get to the real,
the place that we're all kind of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: go, I think everything is relevant,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many lanes cannabis needs to be,
that's a hard question to ask because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: so chemically complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we actually really started looking
at it medicinally and therapeutically,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we would probably find that all these
other cultivars and all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: chemovars are way more relevant than
people think they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because we're right now,
it's just about weed that gets you high or
[SPEAKER_00]: weed that tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about the supplement side or the
lifestyle improvement or the relief from
[SPEAKER_00]: pain and suffering that cannabis brings to
a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's kind of a weird thing that,
you know, medical was a gateway towards
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use, but then medical got kind of
kicked to the curb along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like there's this assumption
that people use their sick kids and cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: and AIDS to make cannabis legal,
which is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's not forget that people had sick
kids and cancer and AIDS, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still need medicine as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole bunch of opportunity
around breeding and products and brands
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that stuff around just wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's, you know,
like the Pink Boos Goddess and that
[SPEAKER_00]: variety really speaks to that in a big
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that what do you want cannabis
to be for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and the fact that it's a low
potency THCV variety that wins awards
[SPEAKER_00]: based off of its just being flower,
you know, people aren't judging it off of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this was, you know, an award winning
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really goes to show that,
you know, you can create new lanes for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis if it's done right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, yeah, once again, it's just,
it's so complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so chemically diverse that it's just
hard to figure out how many lanes you
[SPEAKER_00]: need, you know, because you could
conceivably create, you know, lanes based
[SPEAKER_00]: off of cannabinoids and aroma profiles and
just have, you know, I mean, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's 7,000 different clones of Pinot
Noir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone told me once like different,
different mutations of one clone that
[SPEAKER_00]: still fall under the class of Pinot,
you know, so it's like, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can get pretty nutty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we had like CBG or THCV varieties
with the full spectrum of aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: or do we have, you know, the aroma
profiles with the full spectrum of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just, it's kind of like when
you start crunching the numbers on the
[SPEAKER_00]: data in terms of how many different
offerings you could have from this one
[SPEAKER_00]: genus, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back to the beer thing, we're seeing
that now in hops where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: beer used to taste like beer and now beer
has all these tropical notes and these
[SPEAKER_00]: gassy notes and these fruity notes and
these cereal notes and all these things
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've learned how to manipulate
hop aroma in such a different way that now
[SPEAKER_00]: modern beer doesn't taste like it used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we've just taken a whole different
approach to like, well, what's the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what are the limitations of what
you can do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's once again, just aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you add aroma and effect together and
it's just like, you know, just,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it's a data nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, look, it's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say that about the way it's changed
and the fact you referenced the pink
[SPEAKER_01]: boost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to describe this one to
people for years because I, when was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: 2022?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think last time I was in the States,
I met up with Bodhi and he gave me a jar
[SPEAKER_01]: of the pink boost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't, I didn't know what to
expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And easily one of the most memorable
flowers I've ever vaped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remembered like thinking to myself
like, oh, I get why they call it pink
[SPEAKER_01]: boosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the pistils are pink and it boosts
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's like this, so stimulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because I only ever tried it that one
time, I've like struggled to articulate it
[SPEAKER_01]: any better than like it was awesome
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it felt very uplifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe it for people who
haven't had a chance to try it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think you pretty much nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to me perfectly, to be perfectly
honest, cause I've always got to be honest
[SPEAKER_00]: when we were talking about the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how I experience these minor
cannabinoid one-to-ones and two-to-ones
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff much different than low potency
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning like the thing that resonates most
with me with the variety that's 10% THC is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's 10% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like pink boost goddess is a
perfect example of it's like 8% THC and
[SPEAKER_00]: like seven, eight, 9% THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not really just, you're not just
smoking a THC variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're smoking a low THC variety,
which is important because THC is often
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing that gives people the negative
side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much of it, you know, so is it insane
with CBG?
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it, is it an, obviously the,
the, the modulating and moderating effects
[SPEAKER_00]: of the miners are there, but also the less
negative side effects of the major THC is
[SPEAKER_00]: there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you've diminished it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I, what I haven't tried yet is
like a 20% THC variety that also has 10%
[SPEAKER_00]: or 7% THCV to compare it.
[SPEAKER_00]: More apples to apples, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and I haven't done this,
but I haven't take like a flower that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked a bunch and then just put like a
dab of pure THCV on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that, but that is ultimately where
people discovered what the entourage
[SPEAKER_00]: effect was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, what if you just take THC
alone and then add things to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that tells you that they change the
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I don't know just to be perfectly
honest, but I do know that it smokes like
[SPEAKER_00]: really lovely low potency flower with a
great aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is something that I really like
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think almost everybody would too,
if they just stopped looking at the label
[SPEAKER_00]: and if they had the chance to smoke 10,
12, 15% THC, they'd realize it's just so
[SPEAKER_00]: approachable and you can finish your joint
and you know, or you could come back to it
[SPEAKER_00]: later and you just don't get overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that, in a, you know,
in a way, maybe, maybe cannabis consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe cannabis cultivators need consumers
to smoke lower potency flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just so they can grow more of it,
you know, maybe that's the way to save the
[SPEAKER_00]: market, you know, like instead of selling
one pound, you're selling two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, cause I know for me myself,
most flower, if I roll a joint,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't finish it because it's just a
little bit too potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come back to it later, but low potency
flower, you can kind of smoke like a
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarette and finish it, put it out,
and then later come back and smoke another
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the market, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like beer, you know, you,
you don't want to, you drink one beer
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't want to get too drunk
and you can choose to have another one or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if all beer was the potency of
whiskey, you know, so like, I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: these low potency varieties really have a
place for average consumers, like the same
[SPEAKER_00]: way gummies and vapes do, you know,
it's like, it's like easy, approachable,
[SPEAKER_00]: gentle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I just love smoking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that like the outdoor version of
most varieties that I've bred are more
[SPEAKER_00]: approachable and friendly to consume,
even though they're not as like knock you
[SPEAKER_00]: out or as impressive looking, but like
they just are nicer, kinder, gentler
[SPEAKER_00]: versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's, that has something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pink Boost is also, you know,
those guys are amazing regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow, they're salt of the earth kind
of bulk and they grow healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: organic flowers, sun grown from seed every
year, you know, so you don't just get the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar, you get, you get everything that
comes with it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't, I haven't met the, uh,
the creators, but I had heard they were,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were good folk, much like you
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to quickly ask you, you know,
cause I, I'm not sure if you've done this,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I could just be completely,
you know, out there, but I was wondering,
[SPEAKER_01]: have you ever seen or spoken to anyone who
had like self-deplant just a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: times, just like 10 times, like you're
like S10, something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: like what, what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it just go weird?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I thought maybe, maybe on like the
commercial scale, you guys might've come
[SPEAKER_01]: across someone doing something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know that it happens a bit in terms
of like, um, bringing out recessive traits
[SPEAKER_00]: that are like, uh, bad traits,
like negative traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't actually, I have not selfed a
lot myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some people have done it with
genetics that I've provided them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm actually, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just about to embark on this journey
myself for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I've always bred to select
cultivars to grow, never for seed
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goals have always been make crosses,
run through those and select cultivars to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, to cultivate usually for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I'm kind of like my own breeder
production thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've never produced seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: To sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, I, I, I'm just not really in the
seed production side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been very small batches just
to make enough seed to literally go
[SPEAKER_00]: through, uh, you know, a population to
select cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I do know people have used selfing
for, I know that for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: David Watson used selfing for,
for selecting his, um, single cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties that went into GW's portfolio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a very valuable tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the only tool to really get
to that, to that means, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to that end, because, um, just your
ability to know the, um, chemistry of your
[SPEAKER_00]: both parents, you know, males,
males are a variable that nobody,
[SPEAKER_00]: males add time in a big way, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, while we're on the topic of
males, do you, do you think there's any
[SPEAKER_01]: tips to selecting a good male?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's all sort of random?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you put any stock in anything like,
you know, like morphology or you compare
[SPEAKER_01]: it to the females, anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think it's like, it's kind of
just trial and error really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I, I mean, no matter what
you, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it's always going to be trial and
error just because you don't smoke the
[SPEAKER_00]: mail, but the more analytics you have on
the mail, I mean, you can get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a turp profile from a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, traditionally for me, because,
you know, I'm not a seed producer and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never really done traditional breeding on
that scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's just all the same things that you
look at a female flower for before you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it, you know, structure,
flower time, aroma, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: height, um, branching all that stuff,
you know, and obviously with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: for males that stem rub, you know,
thing really is the best you can get in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of like, what are you going to
consume?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, I, I, I, I still like the
idea of keeping males in the loop,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though all for all practical
purposes, maybe it doesn't make sense for
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of ways, but I guess there's still
some kind of XY chromosome thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, um, you know, cannabis is a
goddess, but there's also a God in there
[SPEAKER_00]: who contributed a little bit in order to
get that female there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, at least now there's a
pollen donor, you know, so there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of that, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, I, I, I'd hate to think that we
got to a world where the male side was
[SPEAKER_00]: completely discarded, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, and I think there's some people
who enjoy the hunt that way that they
[SPEAKER_00]: always are introducing that variable,
but man, it seems like breeders have
[SPEAKER_00]: really pushed towards, uh, you know,
feminized production because of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, controlling the outcome and
having, you know, a little bit more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: ground to stand on when you start,
um, versus just the rolling the dice.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I, you know, back in Amsterdam,
I would always do, um, my breeding would
[SPEAKER_00]: happen in the summer when I could put a
bunch of plants outside and I could select
[SPEAKER_00]: males outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was Amsterdam and they didn't have,
you know, the weather was bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they never really express themselves
the way they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of like a survival of the
fittest kind of strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know people have a lot of different
strategies for how they select their
[SPEAKER_00]: males, you know, but, um, yeah,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be, to be honest, I haven't been doing
a great deal of breeding over the past few
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been about every year I make a
selection or two and that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's usually just kind of on a,
on a hobby level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've made a lot of seed, just,
you know, like we're saying earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty easy to make a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made a lot of seed and a lot of
crosses that I really want to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I'm doing some feminized stuff
right now, just because I've got some,
[SPEAKER_00]: some new things that I want to bring in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got, um, some stuff that I want
to preserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I want to do some S ones
from some old cuts that I don't have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of seed from, but for the most part,
I would really just love to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff I have from years gone by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I could, I would love to do some
rescue work on really, really old seed
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have from way, way, way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think that's, that's like what
would get me the most excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I could pop anything right now,
I'd pop the beans that I've got from the
[SPEAKER_00]: 80s that I still have that I've been
keeping in relatively good condition over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just because I think that most of us
didn't ever get a chance to work through
[SPEAKER_00]: large populations of seeds from the old
school stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, especially if we were
indoor growers, we got big bags of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and pop 10 of them and selected a female
and then grew that for years versus,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, taking 500 seeds of some stuff
that you've always wanted to look deeper
[SPEAKER_00]: into and just like doing a full round and
looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be super exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you totally preempted my next
question, which was going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you got a lot of rest stuck in
your vault.
[SPEAKER_01]: What to you is rare?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, stuff that doesn't have the modern
influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just that, that OG Kim, you know,
blue dream Durbin, you know, Jack,
[SPEAKER_00]: all those things that got into everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have Big Sur stuff that came from a
Mexican heritage and I have Big Sur stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that came from African heritage that goes
way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, they've been in somewhat cold
storage for, you know, the majority of the
[SPEAKER_00]: years, but not always.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not in great condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also got land raised stuff that I've
gotten from friends over the years,
[SPEAKER_00]: some from their things that they're like
breeders that I know that make crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, like crosses for themselves
or things that they keep for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like things that they don't
release that they've given me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is, this is the, here are the
seeds that I used to find the mail that I
[SPEAKER_00]: used to make this plant, but they never
used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because, you know, there's,
it's like the old, um, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: F ones from, you know, a lot of like crops
will not share their parents, but they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: share the F ones because their parents are
too special, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll never release the thing that made
the F ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so some of that stuff, I'd love to
explore other people's old school stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got just land raised things that
people have given me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but really, I mean, if I could,
I, right now I would probably just go
[SPEAKER_00]: through all the oldest sage seeds that I
have that made the stuff that ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming the parents for TH seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because there was some females,
there's so much, so much, um, such a
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum of, of, um, females in there that
there were some that I overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and out of necessity, it could only
keep, you know, a few of the selections
[SPEAKER_00]: and things where I like, Oh man,
I really should have kept that one really
[SPEAKER_00]: unique effects, different feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I had this one variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a sage, it was a pure sage,
but it was one cultivar that we had me and
[SPEAKER_00]: a friend selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had this really relaxing,
Sativa feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like, you know how you get that
headband on your head and it feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: the head, the, like the rubber band is
going up towards the top of your head and
[SPEAKER_00]: lifts up off the top and pops off,
you know, that effect, that kind of crown
[SPEAKER_00]: thing where it's like, you feel like the
very tip of your head kind of tingle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one had the opposite where it went
down and it felt like, um, it felt like
[SPEAKER_00]: water dripping down your head onto your
shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you just had this, ah, this kind of
settling feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it was super, super subtle and you
had to like appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to like be in the space to
appreciate it, but it was really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend and I that selected it,
we were both just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand this isn't like market
friendly flower, but that has something
[SPEAKER_00]: unique that you don't feel in other
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that kind of stuff, you know,
we're in a time when you could only keep
[SPEAKER_00]: what was really, you know, selling or what
you could afford to, to mom up or to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep in storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I'd saved all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause I, I, as you can tell,
man, I'm all about effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause ain't that what the heads are all
about, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chasing that ultimate effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I wanted to quickly ask you before we
jump onto the tail end and the quick fire
[SPEAKER_01]: questions is about six months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even a bit longer, I interviewed
Chanti and he spoke very fondly about,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, he, he was sort of saying,
you know, this one time I got this
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible batch of skunk seed from Rob
Clark.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I never got skunk seed stock
like that since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it got me thinking maybe over the
years, you've been lucky enough to have
[SPEAKER_01]: been exposed to some of this mythical
stuff through Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any, any sort of standouts that you've
been able to try or seed stock of his that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're sort of iron off and thinking,
Oh, wouldn't mind cracking some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, I'll say this, um, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I haven't because I've been so focused
on Sage for all the years that I really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I, and I, I've grown a lot of
other things, you know, in for the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial market, you know, especially 10
years ago, 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I recently, um, so they, they had a
hay skunk that was just killer back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, like, like you
wouldn't, it wasn't something you could
[SPEAKER_00]: buy at a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be something that they pull out of
their pocket, you know, and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: here, have a bud and smoke it,
which was always the best weed ever
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never something that came out of a
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something that someone gave you,
but, um, I've always wondered what the
[SPEAKER_00]: original Sage was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always wondered, you know,
um, because it was clearly a hay something
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was a hay skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been a Hayes Afghan
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have been a lot of people used to
think it was NL5 Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I have, so I have a 30 year old
clone, 20, actually 29 year old clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it's the, the, um, the sister of
the, or the, the, um, the back cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, F1 of the original, um, cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, at the time, I never thought it was
as special as the original female and it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of got back, Bernard, but it was the
one that survived over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still have it to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, I didn't, I only grew it
a couple of times, you know, and I've kept
[SPEAKER_00]: the, it's been passed around and I've had
it for a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it back, um, a few years ago,
but anyway, I flowered it just,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, last year, actually, no, it was this
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do a bunch of weird photo period
trials and put things out at different
[SPEAKER_00]: times and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fascination of my night or night
interruption and stuff, um, for photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period extension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I trialed it and I put it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I smell, I walked up to it and
smelled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so obviously skunk one in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so obvious now, like 30 years
later going like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't grow a lot of skunk and
having smelled a lot of like pure skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: one in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a long time since I smelled
it in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I've grown that plant long time,
decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in hindsight, I'm pretty sure that the
original Sage was a hay skunk because they
[SPEAKER_00]: had some killer hay skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I think about like all of the
seed that I saved, it always came out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bud from somebody who gave me a bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unmarked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't out of a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't come out of a little package
from a coffee shop with a name already
[SPEAKER_00]: written on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like an unknown random bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I put two and two together,
I'm like, I really think that that first
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was probably hay skunk out of a seed
of hay skunk that came from a bud that Rob
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, so I have tried some of the killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I think that's in there cause it's
clearly not Northern lights and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly not Chamba and it's clearly not
Hayes and it's clearly not all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only thing that it really leans
towards is skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: One.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a few weeks or maybe less,
I'm going to bring Rob over and I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to stick it under his nose and say,
just tell me or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that skunk one in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, then I'll know for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay, that was what contributed
that part to Sage was Hayes skunk times
[SPEAKER_00]: Chamba rock art indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great answer to that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got just a few quick patron ones
before we do the final five.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one is, can you tell us anything
about the Big Sur Nigerian?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of the folklore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there could be things in Big Sur,
the Nigerian, but the African cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: that was grown in Big Sur was mainly
Malawi based.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came in with the Peace Corps in 1976,
came into LA, corn cobs came up to Big
[SPEAKER_00]: Sur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people started growing African
varieties in Big Sur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very first cannabis that I ever grew
in 1983 myself from seed was, was from
[SPEAKER_00]: that Malawi stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my sense memory, that's part
of that whole smell thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in, in Big Sur, there's a place called
Esalen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mineral Springs sulfur bath place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was, you know,
concerts there and there's lots of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, events that have happened over the
years, kind of a new age epicenter thing
[SPEAKER_00]: for, you know, counterculture and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every 4th of July, Babatunde Olatunje,
who's a Nigerian drummer, who's also a
[SPEAKER_00]: family friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He played in it, also played in the band
with my dad at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would come and stay in Big Sur and they
do these events.
[SPEAKER_00]: These 4th of July drum troupe events with
another family friend of ours who led the
[SPEAKER_00]: troupe with him, Gordy Ryan, who's son
married my niece, all part of the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they would come there and they were
Nigerian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is all I can say is that I know
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know any other story that
matches what this is just my reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember sitting out on the bluffs
with them as a young kid, smoking the
[SPEAKER_00]: weed, my brother grew, which was Malawi
and smoking it with them saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey man, you guys want to try some African
weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And getting high with the drum troupe
smoking African weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in the early 80s,
82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, that range,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never remember anyone from their side
sharing seeds with us and growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be totally wrong, but I think what
happened is because of the Malawi Chamba
[SPEAKER_00]: thing in Big Sur and because of Babatunde
Olatunje being a Nigerian drummer who came
[SPEAKER_00]: and played in Big Sur and stayed with my
family, stayed at my brother's house and
[SPEAKER_00]: we smoked weed with them, maybe even gave
them seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe at some point they shared seeds,
but I think the lore behind the Big Sur
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Nigerian thing came from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've even heard there's websites and
there's things talking about Olatunje and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and stuff, but I don't know
anything about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I know is that he's been a family
friend since the early 70s and we shared a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of weed with them and we grew African
varieties and Chamba is an African variety
[SPEAKER_00]: and Malawi corn cobs were grown in Big Sur
and they were part of the holy weed
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I can really say for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if it's just another
telephone thing where someone heard
[SPEAKER_00]: something and then they heard something
and someone retold that story,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I know now it has been accepted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not accepted, but it is part of
the holy weed story is maybe that the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds came from Babatunde Olatunje and I
just really, really, really, really don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was a friend and they loved weed
and maybe at some point they brought seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and shared them, but that would have
happened much, much later.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have happened in the late 80s
or early 90s, I would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by then I think the story that people
are trying to tell is a story from the
[SPEAKER_00]: 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like the timelines don't quite
line up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last Patreon question we had for you
was, can you please tell us the headband
[SPEAKER_01]: backstory?
[SPEAKER_00]: You saved the best for last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, it's controversial,
but this is just my perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just the story from my life and
I'm sure there's other stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to step on anyone's toes,
but this is the way it happened from me
[SPEAKER_00]: and with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned earlier, I knew the sour
diesel guys dating back from, I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know, 93, 94.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came back to Amsterdam,
I'm going to give you the long-winded
[SPEAKER_00]: version.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I came back to Amsterdam and I was
making hash, I had a girlfriend who lived
[SPEAKER_00]: in Big Sur and she was going to college in
Vermont, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had given her some water hash that
I'd made and she was sitting around a fire
[SPEAKER_00]: circle, campfire thing with some other
college mates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Hampshire College,
I think is what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she pulled out a piece of hash and the
guy looked at the hash and took a hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, whoa, I haven't seen hash
like that since Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made by this guy, Mo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, whoa, that's my boyfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was an old friend and we haven't been
in contact for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she got his number and she gave me the
number to my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: His handle on Instagram is SourSilicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a glass blower, but he's the guy who
popped the original sour diesel bean,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kim Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Kim Dog of unknown male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he popped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I 100% believe their story because
when I learned the story, there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: utility in them lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just guys who had a couple of
lights in the closet kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned into something bigger over
the years, but they were just friends who
[SPEAKER_00]: had this amazing club.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm in connection with the sour
diesel guys again through my girlfriend,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was weird, a little piece of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd also was connected with Josh D and
his crew in LA at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the sour diesel guys came
through and I showed them OG for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time, then just called Kush, they right
away were like, whoa, this is the diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd you get this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what do you mean,
sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, no, it's like the diesel,
the diesel before sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was that gas note.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just like was a signal to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, there's something here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can never get sure like,
is this a clone you're talking about or
[SPEAKER_00]: just like a class of gassy weed or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were just all about like,
whoa, where'd you find this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it would be nice to bridge
those two worlds, the sour and OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got cuts of the sour and gave it to
the OG guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got cuts of OG and gave it to the
sour guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, helped facilitate
the transfer of those two clones to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam, which was the first time that
they both showed up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sour diesel had been there earlier,
but it got removed from the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so now both groups had the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was kind of the gas, the
intersection of the gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time, because LA, which is very
foreign to me, I grew up in a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie outdoor grower thing where everyone
was a very different world than an LA
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor thing, which was kind of driven by
money and driven by opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of unsavory characters
that were often involved in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: trade at that time, in the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis was worth $6,000 to $8,000 a
pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it brought along some unscrupulous
characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I gave the OG to the sour guys
then living in Sonoma, I just said,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you shouldn't call it Kush because
there's a little bit of a click around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only very few people have this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a little bit of a track record
and it's got a signature aroma profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe call it something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he called it Headband because
Headband was something that they used as a
[SPEAKER_00]: descriptor to describe the effect of a
good snap and where you feel that
[SPEAKER_00]: constriction around your head,
that tightness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he called it Headband and started
selling it in the Bay Area, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: selling sour maybe as headband and also
selling flower that might have seeds as
[SPEAKER_00]: headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it quickly became OG was headband or
beans that came out of OG were headband or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even sour was headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a new marketing tool and it
was a new name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know people have used that name for
weed predating that time, 2001,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that there's a surviving
cultivar around today that came from
[SPEAKER_00]: Headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever they call these Headband on
the East Coast in the 90s, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what that plant is and I don't know where
it is today and if it survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they call Headband today,
as far as I know, came from the renaming
[SPEAKER_00]: of OG and for this crisscross over OG or
sour being called Headband or seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: came out of those plants being called
Headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the modern Headband today
is definitely a different plant because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was seed, it was selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was people made seed companies and
bred with it and turned it into a new
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how it came back into the world and
where those original heritage,
[SPEAKER_00]: the founders of what modern Headband is,
is OG or sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a renaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a renaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the way I saw it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never seen anything else to say
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a weird story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's layers and layers that go
deeper into it because of weird
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition dynamics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole show in itself just telling
that whole story because of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamics around sour diesel and the guys
that were growing it and how it soured
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships and all the dynamics around
OG Kush and who was growing it and what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of opportunities were created and
relationships and burnt bridges and all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a weird time for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where Headband came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love for anybody out there to not
only challenge that, but show me some,
[SPEAKER_00]: any lineage, any plants anywhere that came
from a different Headband or a different
[SPEAKER_00]: origin story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's where it came from as far
as I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard from two different people that
that is the backstory on the Headband cut
[SPEAKER_01]: they have at least that it originates from
a renamed OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's just like a really good OG
essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look, I'm happy to believe you for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, and it's, well, it's not even,
it's just before OG was OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just Kush and there's only one
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the, that's the big one is
now there's like all these OG became a
[SPEAKER_00]: class of its own, like OG's plural,
like, oh, what kind of OG do you grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: But OG was actually something that was,
OG was a descriptor for Kush was Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG was saying our OG that was grown by the
OG guys who did it right and are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they're kind of reverse where OG's
became the genetic or became the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of Kush being the plant,
OG being the crew and the people and the
[SPEAKER_00]: style and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kush is just Kush and Kush might be TK
and Kush might be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's debatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of how the world experienced
OG today, it came from just one clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Kush that came to California and
it went to Silver Lake and then it went
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that's like, I think it's
also important just to remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the same with diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk about the different,
what sour diesel do you grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, there's only one sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a clone only plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a clone only plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been used a lot and they've been
renamed and they've been called this,
[SPEAKER_00]: that and the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can all argue about where they came
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of the clone, there's one
sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, look, that brings us to our quick
fire questions for the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first one I wanted to ask you,
what is the single best or most memorable
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with cannabis you've ever had?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first thought that came to my
mind was the first plant that I ever grew
[SPEAKER_00]: myself when I was 13 and I put a seed on
my mom's balcony and one of her flower
[SPEAKER_00]: pots, probably without even asking her,
which also speaks to the vigor of old
[SPEAKER_00]: school seeds, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could just take any seed and
stick it in a pot and you'd get a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grew up a few feet and it got to
the point where it was popping up over the
[SPEAKER_00]: balcony and my mom's like, no,
we can't do this anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to a friend of mine who's living
in the Palisades and I said, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: can we finish this plant at your place?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had about 15 or 20 plants grown in
his backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was African seed that came from
Malawi from Big Sur flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother had grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Christmas, my brother would give us
a little jar of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a 13 year old kid with my own
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I brought it to my friends and my
buddy who was like 15 years older than me,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 20 years older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was probably 20 years older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grew it and then harvested it on
Thanksgiving night, 1983.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stayed up all night trimming flower in
the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one plant that I had was by far
the best out of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I named it Eleanor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I picked Eleanor because it reminded
me of Dolores, the Mexican variety that
[SPEAKER_00]: was popular in Big Sur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Eleanor was this one plant and it
produced amazing African flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had the best high out of everything
in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it eventually got sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kept a very small amount to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest got sold and I got the profit
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went and bought a video camera,
one of these big giant bulky video
[SPEAKER_00]: cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was a 13 year old kid who went
around documenting everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all because of this one seed
that I just one day decided to put in my
[SPEAKER_00]: mom's pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was right, that was when I really
first felt that like, I'm not going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like not the power of cannabis,
but the significance it can play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like changing your life where I was
like, I was just a kid, but now I was the
[SPEAKER_00]: kid who grew the best weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew, I drew the best weed and I
made some money off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm like doing something with my
life because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was also that same chemical aroma
signature thing that resonates with me
[SPEAKER_00]: still today, which is that tropinoline
dominant, uplifting, soaring, energetic
[SPEAKER_00]: flower that even as a 13 year old kid,
I still felt it then, and I feel it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been my journey has been like
just keeping that torch going for like
[SPEAKER_00]: different and amazing flower that can
stand out within, out of the population as
[SPEAKER_00]: being something special and unique and
people want to have in their lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So full circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that same profile aroma just
keeps popping its head up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other end of the spectrum,
what would be one of the more
[SPEAKER_01]: disappointing strains of varietals you've
come across?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, often I phrase it as,
you know, one where everyone's really
[SPEAKER_01]: hyping it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really excited to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually you get it and you're
like, oh, is that all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: the weird thing for me is I could almost
say that about all Afghani cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it, it's almost hard for me to even
feel the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just like, and I kind of
acknowledge that I have a high tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: to some things like, you know,
like I have a high tolerance to edibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance, like they, I need a good,
you know, 50, 60 milligrams to really feel
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Indica's for me are almost like hard
to put my finger on how I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's just this kind of soft muted
kind of sensation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always been like struggling to
even see like, what is, what does Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights feel like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does Afgui and Romulan and all these
things that some people really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really love and really have like this,
you know, that relaxing couch lock thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'd love to be able to lock into a
couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sounds like, you know,
what a great, you know, opportunity,
[SPEAKER_00]: like just to be able to take a couple of
hits and just sink into a bean bag and
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like, ah, but it just doesn't have
that effect with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it just doesn't, doesn't ring my
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always been fascinating for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often that's really beautiful,
chunky, early flowering, amazing weed that
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd really want to resonate with you
because it's so, you know, it's good to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to breed with, but that's why
I've always been on my, my path has been
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, for me, for my,
you know, my process or my neurochemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever it is that these other
varieties, I feel them in such a profound
[SPEAKER_00]: way where some stuff I just, it just
doesn't even, it's almost not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, a lot of the modern weed
that's out there today, and I hate to
[SPEAKER_00]: sound like an old guy and say like modern
weed, but a lot of weed, people give me
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't even, it's like, it's almost
like no effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just throw it in the deep freeze and
then maybe years later make hash out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: or do something or I don't know,
but so much flower I tried today just
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't, doesn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I can't explain, but the flavors
there, you know, and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I smoke something that I know
does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so profoundly works for me that
I'm just always curious that like why
[SPEAKER_00]: these varieties became really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's back to this thing of aroma,
like aroma over effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the aroma thing in spades.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like amazing, amazing, amazing
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can certainly agree with that one for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to drop you off on a desert
Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give you three strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got infinite resources to keep
growing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take clones or seeds if you want
to do a little breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to take with you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like, well, I think, I think I
would take a big batch of sage seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I could go back to like my 98,
like the last time I made seeds myself
[SPEAKER_00]: from those original parents, those 98
seeds, I'd take a big batch of those
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's so much diversity in there
and you could kind of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: steer the ship, whatever direction you
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of feel, but I, I want to give
props to my good friend who recently
[SPEAKER_00]: passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael, who grew some amazing,
amazing land race drive varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had an El Dorado that was just so
elegant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like just made you feel like whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still love smoking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also used to love smoking his
African haze from ACE seeds because it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is truly psychedelic weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I guess that's, I guess what
I would get out of that is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I want, I love flower that makes
you feel like comfortable and relaxed and
[SPEAKER_00]: connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also love flower that gets you right
on that razor's edge of being
[SPEAKER_00]: uncomfortably high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like sweaty palms and just like,
oh, and to me, some of those, those
[SPEAKER_00]: African varieties and some of those hazes
are just have that in a way where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it's the, uh, you know, it's the
sacrament side of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always want that to be a part of,
of my life, you know, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that you touched on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next question is who are your three
top three or just three of your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders from all time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, the first, the, the first one
that pops, I got to give props to David
[SPEAKER_00]: Watson because he gave us the things that
we used to breed all the things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: love, you know, in a big way, you know,
so without, you can't talk about a breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: without talking about David, um,
just because I'm a total Hayes head and we
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't, even though he didn't develop
Hayes, but he made and distributed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he created the Hayes that we all know
and love today, or at least brought it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I love what Bodie has been doing over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love just the idea of sourcing that
diversity and making crosses to bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: to people and let people play with it and
go forward that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's, that's just,
um, um, really has a huge role in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'd have to say, um, Cause I
mean, I, I, uh, you know, I, and I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions with people about this
difference between a breeder or a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: producer and seed companies versus
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are different to me, you know,
because people like, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan Lee and Steve Habba and the work that
they did with Napro research, they did
[SPEAKER_00]: really amazing breeder breeding work,
you know, and, but I think what people
[SPEAKER_00]: want to hear is like, what about the stuff
that's out there today?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's why Bodie,
I think is so important because he's
[SPEAKER_00]: brought, he brings the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brings things that are relevant in the
modern world, but also brings the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that have that diversity from all that
cannabis can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think I already mentioned,
well, I'll just say, okay, Todd McCormick
[SPEAKER_00]: is also doing something amazing by keeping
the, the, um, the primary colors of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, the foundational building
blocks, keeping them separate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The NL, the Shunk One, the Durbin,
the Hayes, um, those things, if you look
[SPEAKER_00]: at what they created, we can't just
overlook that they're still available as
[SPEAKER_00]: tools, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's really important
to not just rapidly move forward in a poly
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid world, but to always keep going
back and say, like, you know, that's why,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, if I could go back, I'd go back to
the seventies and eighties and pull things
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I'll say, yeah, David,
Todd and Bodie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give those three.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the work that they're doing for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some super solid picks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you almost preempted my final
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's flesh it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: As usual.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a time machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it to go anywhere,
any place, any time, collect whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you going to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to collect?
Ooh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, the funny thing is I just
thought about, like I thought about the
[SPEAKER_00]: early, early days of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was thinking about like that story
about my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm a, I love jazz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jazz is really, um, um, I love,
I love how cannabis fits into jazz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's like, and that's, trust me,
they weren't smoking Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a perfect example of like where
Sativa fits in and Afghan doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're playing bebop and you're doing
this crazy, like improvisational stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: with like six different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like on the edge of your seat,
just trying to move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move as fast as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a different type of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something that's stimulating and
like, just like thought provoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so I love the idea of these
varieties that people were consuming in
[SPEAKER_00]: the forties, fifties and early sixties
before this kind of drug trade happened
[SPEAKER_00]: because of beatniks and hippies,
you know, because that stuff was more land
[SPEAKER_00]: race in my opinion, because there wasn't a
bunch of guys from California going down
[SPEAKER_00]: to Mexico and saying, no, I want you to
grow it like this or grow this way or grow
[SPEAKER_00]: this one more than this one, because this
is the one we want to buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, you know, Colombian and
Brazilian and African and Indian and Thai
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, but probably majority of
the Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it was a different type of
cannabis, I imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was also the stuff that kind of
made us fall in love with modern cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, through, um, through that blues
and jazz culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it was just so prevalent and
it married well with that type of music
[SPEAKER_00]: and that type of mindset and that open
mindedness and that kind of liberal free
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it would have been really cool to
know, you know, what was Louis Armstrong
[SPEAKER_00]: puffing on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I heard he was puffing on some
pretty bad stress, but I heard some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other cats like later in the fifties were
like, man, we got really good stuff now,
[SPEAKER_00]: Louis, you know, you should try what we
got now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I, I just loved it to know what
that was like, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like back to my mom's story, when she
tells her story about the first week she
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked, it sounded like really good week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounded like the kind of experience
that everyone would like to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I'd just be super duper curious
what that was like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be brilliant to know what they
were puffing on for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that, I think it just about brings
us to the end of it for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there any comments or shout outs you
wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think we touched on a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I had a great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really know how to get the
conversation going here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, no, I was really,
really stoked to have this conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: with you and, and, um, and looking forward
to hearing the podcast come out the other
[SPEAKER_00]: end and, um, excited for the work that
you're doing, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you are these types of
stories and the people that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: interviewing are really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, um, the genetics and the
people and their stories are kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: the last big, most important thing we have
to offer as we come out of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do really feel that, that,
you know, all the other stuff is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: handle itself, you know, in terms of like
agriculture and the supply chain and
[SPEAKER_00]: commerce and dispensaries and laws and
regulations, but the plants and the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that brought them here, that can never be
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really important just for the
historic record to, to put that out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and share how it's relevant to
the world we live in today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for having me on and thank
