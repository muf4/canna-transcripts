[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome, friends, for another
episode of Not In My Bag, your number one
[SPEAKER_01]: spot for all things cannabis news,
discussion, and recent events.
[SPEAKER_01]: As usual, you're joined by your boys,
Mean Gene of Mendocino and Mr Heavy Days
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Upside Down Library.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here today, we are thrilled to be joined
by an epic breeder, the man behind the
[SPEAKER_01]: black dog lines you've no doubt heard
about, a NorCal local legend, and a friend
[SPEAKER_01]: of both Gene and myself, a massive welcome
to Jesse of BioVortex for joining us
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're excited to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without further delay, let's get into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to the third episode of
Not In My Bag, your number one cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: news and current affairs discussion show.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I'm grateful to be joined and
carried by my co-host, Mr Mean Gene of
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino and on today's episode,
we are stoked to be joined by a friend of
[SPEAKER_01]: both of ours, an incredible Mendocino
based breeder, creator of the black dog
[SPEAKER_01]: lines and many more, a massive welcome to
Jesse of BioVortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually up in humble, but I love
Mendocino too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adopting him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all right, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole triangle, yeah, I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know, what have you been smoking
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess actually, you know, it's kind of
random as I pulled out some banana OG from
[SPEAKER_00]: the very first wash I did with Adam from
some actual like really nice trim and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a 90U and it was so insanely good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, this is trim hash and it was
like some of the best hash I'd ever seen
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 2014 and it was just complete
full melt, beautiful hash from trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually the next year that we
then continued on and did a whole fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: frozen project and like made some of the
like most amazing hash those next years
[SPEAKER_00]: with the like coastal grown, just no dust,
just as clean as possible grown from the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, thinking about it from hash
from the beginning, but put away some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the freezer for like a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found it and pulled it out and was
like, this is actually just rolling some
[SPEAKER_00]: spliffs and it rolls in so nice with some
decent tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then mixed it actually with some GMOB
and some mandarin, double mandarin cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: lime dog from the Newcomb farms and rolled
up several of those up to go to the beach
[SPEAKER_00]: and collected a whole bunch of rocks,
actually have an outdoor shower and
[SPEAKER_00]: bathtub.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so collecting really interesting rocks
to go under the shower and the,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the tub.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each rock is actually hand shows it
under your, your feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But had to roll some spliffs for that,
but it was pretty cool to like find that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's 90 you trim hash from so long ago
that just it held up and it actually cured
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that was just so nice to roll
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the last two days kept going to
that even though it's from 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it like, it just all of a sudden
is like gone once you like start absorbing
[SPEAKER_00]: it in with your, your fingers and get that
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was kind of funny 10 years,
10 year vintage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think probably from the next year,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it was the fresh frozen and it was so
tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was super blazed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were down at that thing at the
honeysuckle Lotus party.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I met all those guys and me,
you and Johnny went down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember I was hitting it and I was
like, I had never seen the straight banana
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, wow, it really is banana,
you know, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the kind of candy runs kind of
thing, like all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's like gas with it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what about
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself, Mr. Mean Gene, what have you
been smoking on?
[SPEAKER_03]: All the, all the throat stuff is
definitely, you know, if you're smoking a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of weed, I think everyone understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: I myself have been smoking on,
as I'm doing work and stuff, I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking on this little bit of probably
kind of similar to what he's smoking on
[SPEAKER_03]: texture wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, I think it was made from dry weeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's water hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got it from the dude, Jerry,
who I met at a, at a party up at the 101.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's the dude that does Jerry seed
swap and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hadn't met him before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had this Vietnamese hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you smell it, it's very like pine
and turpentine smelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it smokes really nice, but I didn't
actually smoke any right now because on
[SPEAKER_03]: the last one, when we had the sticker
farmer on, I was smoking it right before
[SPEAKER_03]: the show and during the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I started going into some kind of
a thing and I couldn't remember where the
[SPEAKER_03]: hell I was at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after a while, I was like,
I don't know where my train of thought
[SPEAKER_03]: was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realized like, yeah, I probably
shouldn't be smoking the Vietnamese hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's smoke it after the show,
but it's great for like the daytime
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's really clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought maybe it might have a little
bit of like the heart racing, sativa
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, because I'm not really used to
Vietnamese stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't, it's really pleasant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't say it's mild because it gets
you high, but it is really like pleasant
[SPEAKER_03]: and enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as hash, it doesn't have any kind of a
flavor of being like the heavy turpentine
[SPEAKER_03]: or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just has a nice good old school hash
flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been smoking it in a little
homemade oak pipe that my kid made.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all charred and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you can see it's got the little
hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke it with a torch lighter from real
far away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just kind of like, it kind of vapes
it like a cold, like a cold start dab in a
[SPEAKER_03]: sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really get a good flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, it's silly, but it's just
kind of fun because it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, my kid's too young to be smoking
and stuff, but he saw people carving pipes
[SPEAKER_03]: and he's like, oh, that's a thing to
carve.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he likes to whittle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and then I took it and I'm smoking out
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's all, dude, where's that pipe I
made?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I was smoking out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, you got, you can't smoke
out of my pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm smoking out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned the tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smoking some, some Rizak, which was
grown by my buddy Bin Chicken.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually doing some cool work with
ABC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's should check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Rizak is Chernobyl by TGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone knows that by a string called
Azazel by my buddy, always be flowering,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's like the mother is black tie,
which is the ACE seeds, the black
[SPEAKER_01]: Vietnamese cross to the tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it just channels all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this plant, it's like a tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a jungle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he grew it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like got this awesome,
you know, sort of sativa effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it ties in perfectly with your tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also ties in perfectly with our
first story actually, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, you got something to show and tell
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tie tie dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was in Hawaii last year,
a guy did a double cross of tie on the
[SPEAKER_00]: black dog over the last several years and
like realized what it was and came up and
[SPEAKER_00]: brought me the seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of super fun and called it tie tie
dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was a really great name.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could almost like generate a sativa
line of black dog out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how sativa they'll be looking
with black dog in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those would be really cool hybrids though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, also as far as cold start dabs,
that's like one of my favorite ways to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But GMob from Radical Herbs is what I've
been smoking on lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like their last year's harvest was
insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last two years, just so good and just
complex and diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the most terpene diverse testing
I've ever seen in hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just the savory and the gas and the
dessert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like all these things kind of happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of a go-to over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also found some of the old
banana SFV dog in the freezer and pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of cool because that was the
male that was used in the original GMob.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was kind of cool to taste those
back and forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the one we were dabbing after
your premiere?
[SPEAKER_03]: When I came up there, when I stayed at
your house, it was a banana something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember?
[SPEAKER_03]: That one was really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: The high on it was so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember like, I mean, of course
set and setting, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was having- Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we did a few and I think we did do
straight banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we did do banana SFV dog and
Mandarin that night, but it might've been
[SPEAKER_00]: the Simply Adam banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he did, I think I pulled out some
of those where he did actually a freeze
[SPEAKER_00]: dryer and a air dried kind of batch where
each one was blind style where just have a
[SPEAKER_00]: number on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a whole tasting note thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I pulled some of those out for
the full banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also had some green source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of the banana dog crosses,
which were a little bit more kind of full
[SPEAKER_00]: hashy flavor, but melted really nice too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember that it was definitely
something banana, but I think it was
[SPEAKER_03]: different because I remember, I think it
was a little bit different because I had
[SPEAKER_03]: already tried the other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just remember that the effect on it,
like I said, set and setting, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, of course we were having a lot of
fun and everything, but I just remember
[SPEAKER_03]: like the feeling, like the feeling of like
hitting it and just like the warm feeling
[SPEAKER_03]: of well-being.
[SPEAKER_03]: With no like edge of anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like, Ooh, this is,
that was a nice one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked that one a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's actually the exact same one
that I just was dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the banana SFV dog, cause I'd had
that jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a large one that I put away in the
jar for, or in the fridge for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think that might be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Banana SFV dog sounds incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should probably jump into our first
story for this week, which is tying back
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Thai we referenced before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get a little sticker out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Thailand is flagged that their stance
on cannabis is likely going to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've actually gone so far as to say
that all cannabis businesses need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared to shut up shop within the next
12 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is obviously a huge backflip from the
former government's surprise legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has led to many Westerners flocking
to Thailand in the hopes of setting up
[SPEAKER_01]: their own cannabis empire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many have been critical of this and have
cited this as possibly one of the major
[SPEAKER_01]: reasons for the reform, although a new
government has taken power, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: likely a contributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is however, there has been further
concerns raised that the intention
[SPEAKER_01]: initially was that Thai nationals would be
the predominant players within the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, given that currently it's run by
majority expats with ties involved in the
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking as though things are going to
shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a strong vocal opposition to the
change, however, with many protesting the
[SPEAKER_01]: changes, hopeful that they can get some
sort of backflip on the ruling.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, Thailand is not a traditional
Western country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you do have to wonder if any of
these protestings will lead to any change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the question becomes, what do we
think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this the end of legalization for
Thailand and to the greater Asian scene,
[SPEAKER_01]: given Thailand was cited as possibly the
first domino in a chain that may lead to
[SPEAKER_01]: more legalization in Asia in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think, Jesse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty sad to see because we
definitely wanted to see the continued
[SPEAKER_00]: domino effect of more and more places
adopting less draconian laws towards
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and towards people being able to
have the right to grow a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the human right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so many places still have very,
very intense laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia has a lot and so and many places near
Thailand that still have death penalties
[SPEAKER_00]: for things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the US, it wasn't that long ago
that people were getting death sentences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our current president even worked towards
having sentences be more strict for drug
[SPEAKER_00]: offenders and now using this moment to
give more control towards pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: companies with cannabis as a way to say
you're legalizing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as Thailand, it was just really
nice to see that happen, that moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: like maybe it can lead to more.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite things was seeing
farmers were using cannabis for chicken
[SPEAKER_00]: feed and they would stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stopped using antibiotics and were
having better results and healthier
[SPEAKER_00]: chickens just adding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that all of the things that can benefit
from not having these horrific laws when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to a plant that can bring so much
benefit to people is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not necessarily that surprised
because there's always a pendulum of
[SPEAKER_00]: things and it's like you swing one
direction and then things swing back the
[SPEAKER_00]: other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of finding the balanced approach
that makes sense in things, it's always
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, cool, we have this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go too far with it in certain
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's by saying too far, I don't think
there's any too far when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom, but there's too far when it comes
to taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like that mindset of how you you do
something if you're going someplace to the
[SPEAKER_00]: green industry, kind of like concept of
profiting off of something and taking from
[SPEAKER_00]: something instead of just being a part of
producing medicine, being a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing something well or being part of
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I guess often we just we just
see that swing right back after we think
[SPEAKER_00]: something improves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it already happened and I don't
think we've seen too much bad from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that whatever does happen,
it swings back towards decriminalization
[SPEAKER_00]: of a medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's one of those ones where like my
cynical take on it is just like fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: Americans because I'm like, OK,
I really like capitalism.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the idea of people having
opportunities to be able to make something
[SPEAKER_03]: and elevate themselves and their people
and their families.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like the idea of people in Thailand
being able to take because Thailand has a
[SPEAKER_03]: really long established cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows like Thai meat is like one
of those things like, oh, Thai stick or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, all these different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that part, you know, Southeast Asia in
general has a lot of it's obviously been
[SPEAKER_03]: there a long time because they have really
unique cannabis that almost stands out as
[SPEAKER_03]: its own thing that's different than
everything else in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it would have been cool to
be able to see like there when I talk to
[SPEAKER_03]: people, a lot of people were like,
oh, they don't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They they everything's been held back
enough that they kind of need help to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to produce on a level to be able to
have it be like a business thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you go, OK, that would be cool for
people to come in and help them do their
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as soon as I started hearing about it,
everything I'm hearing about is like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, everybody's just shipping last year's
California weed out the back door or out
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever to go over there and liquidate
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you go somewhere to buy weed,
I had I have a friend from Canada and he
[SPEAKER_03]: was like, I just went to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's all guess what I bought.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, oh, what did you get?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he goes, I just bought it eight
of California half brown runs for eighty
[SPEAKER_03]: five dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, my God, like this is so it
was so disappointing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like when I went to then then
what happens is all around the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course, everybody always wants to know
it's not just it's not just you looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: the magazine center for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a new thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's popular.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it popular?
[SPEAKER_03]: It must be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens no matter where you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there were people in Thailand who are
going, well, I mean, we have this stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it don't get a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look like what people want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people were interested in being able to
produce the kind of weed that was like
[SPEAKER_03]: worldwide and temporary competitive weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like the same thing in like in
Jamaica, all the weed that is really grown
[SPEAKER_03]: for production, it tends to be the stuff
that I look at and go about that,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though it's not specifically unlike
that is like that's California weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's Amsterdam weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can look at the plants and go,
this isn't what would have come from India
[SPEAKER_03]: that was originally Jamaican gonja,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a trip because that's kind of the
same deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like in Jamaica, when I talk to my
friends who live way up in the in the
[SPEAKER_03]: hills, and they are like, yeah,
my grandpa, he grew a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was one of the first big, big weed guys
in the area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm like, oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, what do you guys do you
guys grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, yeah, it's been eradicated
so hard in our area that there's not a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of weed in general right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the weed comes from the
production centers, which they grow all
[SPEAKER_03]: this other stuff I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he was like, we still in this area
when we do grow weed, we grow the
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional weed we call the Indian that
came with it with the people from India
[SPEAKER_03]: when first when it was first introduced,
basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we plant that, it grows and we
don't have to do anything to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we tried to grow all this other
stuff, it rotted, it died in droughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't as hardy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't, you know, what like we would
call here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would say it's like it's Landry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, and he brought me
some of the weed and it was like really
[SPEAKER_03]: stringy and it smelled like turpentine and
pine and it had a really great high,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it wasn't what you would want to
produce, which I imagine is probably what
[SPEAKER_03]: it was like in Thailand, you know,
but what would be cool in Jamaica would
[SPEAKER_03]: have been if people would have gone there
and been like, look, if you can just dial
[SPEAKER_03]: this in a little bit and get a little bit
of irrigation and dry it a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: better, you guys can produce Jamaican weed
that's incredible because it was really
[SPEAKER_03]: good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just hadn't been handled like we would
have handled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, but, but it was so like the
identity of it was such Jamaican ganja,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was Indian weed grown in Jamaica for
a hundred years or whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it would have been really cool if
people could have gone into Thailand and
[SPEAKER_03]: been like, okay, you know, we have things
that might've been eradicated here that
[SPEAKER_03]: are these old Thai heirlooms and let's
find the things that are in Thailand that
[SPEAKER_03]: are good that work here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then let's try to dial in your drying
practices and dial in this and try to help
[SPEAKER_03]: like them get their, you know,
people who want to go there really,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, as carpet baggers, like go there
and try to build up what they have and
[SPEAKER_03]: then refine it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead what happens is Americans and
I'm American.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't like say like, oh, it was fucking
Americans, but fucking Americans.
[SPEAKER_03]: We show up over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see an opportunity and we're just
like, let's just ship in all this stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: and we'll sell it over here and not only
do that, but take everything that they
[SPEAKER_03]: have going on and try to kind of push in
and then have them grow all the same
[SPEAKER_03]: things that we would grow and do it the
same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember, uh, back in the day
hearing about how Amsterdam had weed and
[SPEAKER_03]: you could go there and, and like,
you know, everybody knew about Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were alive in the eighties and the
nineties, it was like, whoa, Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's places where you can buy weed,
buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was like that tourist aspect
where, you know, like people said,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, people come here and they do
their thing, but they were just like
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking Americans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it got to the point where after a
while Amsterdam's like, we don't really
[SPEAKER_03]: want weed that much because people eat
four space cakes and throw up on the
[SPEAKER_03]: sidewalk and they get drunk and they're
vulgar with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's like, it's like vulgar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why has it got to be so fucking
much, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like, such like a cultural
mindset and it kind of works where you're
[SPEAKER_03]: at, but when like the old West lands
somewhere that has cultural sophistication
[SPEAKER_03]: and established cultural practices over
thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden you're just there
and you're like, Hey, I'm fucking Billy
[SPEAKER_03]: the kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to fucking roll an ounce and
eat a fucking cheeseburger with eight
[SPEAKER_03]: patties on it and fucking throw up on the
street with my friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just like, it's not really helping
it get established.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that kind of happened to
Thailand and that's like my hot take on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's other ways to look at it
with a lot of nuance, which is just that
[SPEAKER_03]: it probably was like you said,
with the pendulum swinging, it probably
[SPEAKER_03]: was a little bit much too soon in a place
that's so conservative and surrounded by
[SPEAKER_03]: very conservative areas where I'm sure
there's pressure on the Royal family there
[SPEAKER_03]: from places where they're like,
Hey, we're right over here and we hang
[SPEAKER_03]: people for having seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this is not this, you know,
there's probably a lot of nuance and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: going on too, but I don't think it ever
helps when there's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: people just doing things in this big
vulgar American way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, yeah, it's a lot of
fun, but at the same time, I feel like it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it probably got overly exploited.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that the outside
influence probably helped.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's some truth into people
saying that and I can't imagine that
[SPEAKER_03]: that's just not a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a pretty fast change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember scrolling through Instagram and
I saw the hashtag for black dog and these
[SPEAKER_00]: kids in Thailand had made these shirts of
black dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it said, black dog in the back
and they had a beautiful picture of a
[SPEAKER_00]: black dog flower on the front and they had
all their faces with smiley faces in
[SPEAKER_00]: front.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like that to make sure they
stayed anonymous because the laws were
[SPEAKER_00]: actually quite rough at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just what 2015 16 was still
pretty, pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I commented, Oh, cool shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, Whoa, wow,
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Hey, we're sorry we didn't ask to
make them, but can we send you some?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they sent some really cool black
dog shirts and stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and the story behind it was they
actually were growing it and it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were growing black dog seeds and
maybe made a good selection and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing weed and they ended up kind of
having their spot be compromised.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were pretty worried about getting
in a lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they took down the room and,
but they'd got this really good picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower before the end and like,
okay, let's pivot and do a t-shirt company
[SPEAKER_00]: with this picture of the black dog flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, yeah, just like kind of wild
to see, but that was really not that long
[SPEAKER_00]: ago that they were facing some serious
legal fears of going doing some serious
[SPEAKER_00]: jail time for having a grow room versus it
just being full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything kind of goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now who knows what it's going to
swing back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that is an important sort of
counterpoint to make, which is that on the
[SPEAKER_01]: one hand, it's very clear to see and to
point to what you could argue is like a
[SPEAKER_01]: form of sort of exploiting the,
the newly legalized landscape,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with everyone rushing in,
but I think the, the really relevant
[SPEAKER_01]: counterpoint you have to make is that as
much as there is all this runs and Gary
[SPEAKER_01]: Payton being imported, there is a very
thriving and you know, active younger
[SPEAKER_01]: scene in Thailand that want all of this,
you know, California and popular strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like young people in Australia,
just like young people in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, yeah, I think it is worth,
you know, pointing out that there is,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was partially a demand for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's obviously a lot of people in
Thailand who I'm sure want to see like a
[SPEAKER_01]: more terroir and a natural expression,
but yeah, I think it's, it's worth,
[SPEAKER_01]: worth comparing both.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, in, in terms of talking
about coming in and taking over,
[SPEAKER_01]: this works perfectly with our next story,
which is that our good friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: uncle burn, he's back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always in the news, but in this time
for different news, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: him today because burner and cookies have
announced their strategic news.
[SPEAKER_01]: With their intent to acquire cookies,
Florida assets from a company called terp
[SPEAKER_01]: HQ.
[SPEAKER_01]: The announcement follows in the recent
wake of the Florida Supreme court ruling
[SPEAKER_01]: that will now allow adult use cannabis
legalization measures to be on the
[SPEAKER_01]: November ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This also needs to take into account the
recent DEA scheduling playing another
[SPEAKER_01]: vocal, another big factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically burners sees the Florida
ballot as very likely to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going so far as to hedge his bets
that it's going to be worth becoming an
[SPEAKER_01]: active player in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the people who aren't aware,
cookies is a parent company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They license out the ability for other
companies to run cookies stores in
[SPEAKER_01]: respective States that they're not
currently operating in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at burners Instagram and
the cookie stores, he regularly visits and
[SPEAKER_01]: shout outs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones that he and the parent
company owned.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other ones they're privately owned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's hedging his bets that the Florida
ballot is going to pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that there's going to be a huge new
market in Florida on top of the currently
[SPEAKER_01]: existing one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the question needs to be asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we think it's going to be legalized?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we think burner is ahead of the
curve on this one or just a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: optimistic?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think Mr. Mean Gene?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think as potentially big of a
business as they are and can be,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like a worthwhile bet to just
go, okay, if it works, it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it doesn't, then it's not going to
work out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it works out, they're going to win.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's capitalism.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once things are business, that's the one
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's what sticker farmer said last
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like people who are in business,
they're in business.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to do business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they're looking at it,
they're basically looking like,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, if this is going to be a good place
to potentially make a lot of money,
[SPEAKER_03]: then get in there and try to control it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same thing as, that's why I said
about Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, people are just going to
show up and just try to make a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the American thing to do,
is to just try to go wherever you can and
[SPEAKER_03]: make as much money as you can make.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not what I'm into because it's not
what I would want to spend all my time and
[SPEAKER_03]: energy on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But those guys, that's what they're into
doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically if all of a sudden they
weren't doing that, then there would be a
[SPEAKER_03]: vacuum and you would see who else coming
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've talked to Jesse about this in the
past.
[SPEAKER_03]: As much as there's a lot of different
details and nuance and everything to the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole story of all, whatever, California
legal cannabis, branding, cookies,
[SPEAKER_03]: burner, all this stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's that aspect of the American dream
where it's like, okay, I can start here
[SPEAKER_03]: with this little thing and turn it into
this big thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of those weird things because
if you're of one, and there's not only two
[SPEAKER_03]: mindsets, but if you're on one far side,
you're like, I don't want to see anybody
[SPEAKER_03]: do good at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the people who are like,
I want to see people do good, but not at
[SPEAKER_03]: the expense of anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the people who are just
like, just fucking hustle and get money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the most pure form of capitalism,
unfortunately, is the people who are just
[SPEAKER_03]: like, where can we get to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the next opportunity?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as much as that's not my natural
mindset, so that's not what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, there's always going to be
that person that does that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're always, if you're not there,
it's going to just create a vacuum and
[SPEAKER_03]: someone else is going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this case, say what you will about
those guys, but in the case of burner,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least, he went from being a guy who was
like a budtender to a guy who all of a
[SPEAKER_03]: sudden was internationally recognized.
[SPEAKER_03]: And has a lot of stuff under his belt that
he's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then turned into, you know,
now cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, it's this big, huge thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's like somebody's going
to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when there's opportunities like this,
there's no way that they're just going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be like, Oh yeah, whatever, not,
not, you know, risk it for the biscuit.
[SPEAKER_03]: As they say, there's going to be like,
okay, we could maybe go down there and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, and do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, just, you know, I think that's
what's, what's going on is anything that
[SPEAKER_03]: opens up those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know I guess in Thailand,
they had a big presence to cookies,
[SPEAKER_03]: the genetics, the company, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, there's people are going to do
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Germany just opened up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably going to see cookies in
Germany.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and as much as it's like,
okay, like, you know, there was like the
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies and Bodhi collab.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like Bodhi is the is like,
if you know Bodhi in person, you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's like the real like world traveler
plant guy makes his own perfumes,
[SPEAKER_03]: sends me incense in the mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And shit is like what I would consider
like a hippie dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's super cool DJs, drum and bass shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just all super, super cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like way on that side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He travels places, he trades people seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got, you got him on the one hand,
and then you got cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other, you know, and you want to
see like somebody like that be the person
[SPEAKER_03]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people like that, they don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're, burner's the one who's
going to do that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Bodhi's not going to show up and try to
take over the German market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cookie's going to do that, you know,
and it's everybody, you know, but it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, but yeah, whatever happened to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it just, I, it, I think it was not a
good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it really, I don't think it
was a good fit in the sense that the
[SPEAKER_03]: people who want what cookies brings to the
table, a majority of them don't want what
[SPEAKER_03]: Bodhi brings to the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the people who want what Bodhi brings
to the table don't want what cookies
[SPEAKER_03]: brings to the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would be cool if there was overlap,
but in, I think it used to be easier for
[SPEAKER_03]: there to be overlap a long time ago,
because when you saw something,
[SPEAKER_03]: you were offered that and everyone saw the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it was on channel two, everybody
saw channel two and now everything's in
[SPEAKER_03]: bubbles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the people who are going to say
that cookies is mids are the people who
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to be like, have you seen this
crazy thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen, you know, pine soul and the
people I talked about this at a different
[SPEAKER_03]: point too, they're in different bubbles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I don't think that they were able
to, and this, I said this before the thing
[SPEAKER_03]: before that, while they were still doing
it, I was like, I don't know what each
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble is going to get from the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I have friends that I talk to and
I'm like, Oh, what's the cool stuff you
[SPEAKER_03]: have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they pull out all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, this is gelato and this is
gelato and this is gelato.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, this is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, look at this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, this is this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it has, it's been crying.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been getting crossed with whatever,
like it's sure banger, like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good, but it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for the market of the people that are
in that bubble where it's like of all
[SPEAKER_03]: these types, this one is really good,
but for somebody like me, there's nothing
[SPEAKER_03]: novel about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so similar to what the last thing
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then somebody like Bodhi is going to
like, make like some kind of trippy poly
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids with the same things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to be like, Ooh,
that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: that has like the gelato color,
but then you smell it and you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, it has that thing in there that is
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're two, they just kind of sit,
they sit in two different worlds,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, in general, even if they were to
incorporate a little one from the other,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's still gonna always wind up,
I think, kind of splitting off and being
[SPEAKER_03]: two different worlds, really, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had heard that Berner was, pushing it a
lot and that there was other people in
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies who were not into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could imagine that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I heard that it seemed as if he was
really keen to make it happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was other powers that be.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was told at some point that,
like, Bodhi's, I think it was Sunshine
[SPEAKER_03]: Four or whatever that is, Sunshine
Daydream, Sunshine Four, one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things that Berner was like, that's my
favorite weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, cookies, if they put that
in a mylar, everybody who is in that
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble is gonna pull it out and go,
they did a bait and switch.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't cookies weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though you got Berner saying,
this is better, they're still gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I was looking for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody knows that cookies paradigm and
that kind of weed where it's the gelato,
[SPEAKER_03]: Runts was able to jump in there because
it's gelato, all this different stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it doesn't, you know, they don't have
like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that the overlap isn't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a trip when you know people like,
I know people who, if weed is anything
[SPEAKER_03]: like this other weed over there,
it's just instantly gonna be described in
[SPEAKER_03]: a derogatory way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if there's the people who,
if they smell a little bit of turpentine,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like instantly that's, that's shit
train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Jack.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're like, well, I know what
you don't like about those, but this one
[SPEAKER_03]: is different, but it's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same thing with green weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: People would be like, no, I only smoke
purple or it doesn't look visually crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, yeah, but when you smoke
it and they could smoke it and think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: the best when they're like it,
but I like pretty weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, what are you doing with,
you know, but that's just how,
[SPEAKER_03]: how it is that there's, there's big splits
in what people consider good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have some, it's all
subjective is what's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you get things that are
subjective, you get a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_03]: really don't have their own opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what tends to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: That that's what pop is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, if you go, okay, this is what
everybody likes right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always a lot of people who are
like, yeah, that's what's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell it's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause everyone likes it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a lot of people who are
like, yeah, but this thing's good too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, whoa, but nobody likes
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't even, they won't even take
the time to discover if they like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just human nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We go in these groups and some people like
purple, shiny, flashy weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and I mean, you can
incorporate that too, in turn,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like it's not completely out of
Bodie's wheelhouse to be able to go,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, I'm going to pull a fast one on you
and you're going to look at it and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to think it's all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I incorporated these new traits,
but most people who like the character of
[SPEAKER_03]: different weed, like me or Bodie or Jesse
or you, like we, we of course are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be like, okay, I want to have like all of
us here and Bodie all have purple frosty,
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty bag appeal, crazy weed,
but we like it because we like it not
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's the only thing you can like.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have a bunch of other stuff that
maybe might not ever be as popular with
[SPEAKER_03]: the big group, but among the small groups
that are here and there, somebody would be
[SPEAKER_03]: like, oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad all you, I'm glad you don't just
have purple frosty, pretty weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have this odd thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the one I liked because of it
being a subjective experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a weird, weird thing,
but yeah, I mean, I think people just get
[SPEAKER_03]: stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think groups get stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm sure whoever's running
cookies is like, no, we're not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: put that weed in our bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to, not going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they probably get bad feedback if they
try it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly to their own detriment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, look, I mean, this, this sort of
works into our next topic, which is that
[SPEAKER_01]: on the, the last episode we had sticker
farmer on and on that episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: he was talking about how the New York
scene is actually playing a huge role in
[SPEAKER_01]: what's currently popular in the overall
picture of the States at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen a rise in their
distribution, especially in the advent of
[SPEAKER_01]: the new sprayed pack revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're actually seeing is that the
New York scene is playing a major role in
[SPEAKER_01]: determining what is popular in terms of
distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue is that many of the New York
stores and little bodegas that are selling
[SPEAKER_01]: this cannabis are not registered and are
not technically legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the blacklist has posted an interesting
article stating that last week alone,
[SPEAKER_01]: 75 of these stores have been clamped down
and closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just in the first week.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plans for hundreds more of them
over the coming weeks or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the question becomes,
does this positively or negatively affect
[SPEAKER_01]: the scene having the police crack down on
these small suppliers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people have argued that it's going to
push the distribution back onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which may benefit the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll throw it over to you, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, police cracking down on anything
doesn't help anything ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, yeah, just, just no,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how can that help anything ever let
people compete?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know it's probably pretty rough for
a lot of licensed farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just dealing with the situation over
there because it's like, you go through
[SPEAKER_00]: all this effort and, um, and anything kind
of goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my main concern is when, when you get
to those kinds of places where you end up
[SPEAKER_00]: doing something to, uh, anything goes or
something of like standards aren't good
[SPEAKER_00]: with potency or other things are added and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like where everything could be
fine, especially if you did it from like a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical perspective or, um, that if anyone
has issues, then that ends up being the
[SPEAKER_00]: detriment to that kind of, uh,
freedom around the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, I definitely worry about a
bunch of shops, just having anything goes
[SPEAKER_00]: selling whatever without any kind of
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at, at the same time, like we've never
really seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulations or police help anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I, I just always, I missed the,
the medical days here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that should have always been just
strengthened the rights around medical and
[SPEAKER_00]: the testing and patient safety and
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it never should have been,
um, this recreational kind of concept
[SPEAKER_00]: with, um, yeah, I just, it just loses so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's overtaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's overregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a broken system, something that
should be profitable in California is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone who's tried, uh, has,
has lost all kinds of, uh, money and time
[SPEAKER_00]: and effort and has tried so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, um, New York at this moment has a
much more, a lot more freedom,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when things go too far in one
direction and then you get police cracking
[SPEAKER_00]: down, um, yeah, again, I don't think it
ever helps quality or anything when police
[SPEAKER_00]: come in and do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's more about people should be,
uh, educated and, and you, if everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: educated, then people are not going to
want to go to these shady spots,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're going to go to the spot where
you actually have connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think, uh, the competition comes
through quality, through standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: through connecting people with
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think the, the places that
dedicate to that will probably live
[SPEAKER_00]: through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that don't will make a little bit
of money for a little bit before,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, things kind of change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just quickly add before I let,
uh, Mr. Mean Gene take over that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the interesting things about this
is that there's been so much rhetoric
[SPEAKER_01]: from, you know, the, the, the,
uh, the cannabis control policy and the
[SPEAKER_01]: rollout of, um, legalization in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet it seems like the rhetoric doesn't
match like to be like, yeah, we're
[SPEAKER_01]: legalizing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course you need regulations,
but to immediately start by clamping down
[SPEAKER_01]: on all these, like particularly mom and
pop small sort of, you know, they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: most of them are like bodegas,
you know, like they're not, they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: these huge enterprises.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, it's interesting to see,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that the first step in them sort of
trying to roll it out is to just sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: clamp down so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's your thoughts, Mr. Mean Gene?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like Jesse was saying, like we're
with when we had medical that was,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was, you know, there was wheat
stores and they were operational and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything was kind of going fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, yeah, I mean, it's, I don't know
the, the way that, um, the way that they
[SPEAKER_03]: set everything up, it really incentivizes
people to do things the wrong way in that
[SPEAKER_03]: if you have a store, you can imagine it's
a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to just go ahead and rent a building
and get a bunch of weed and sell it from
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do it that way, you're going to
be able to sell it for really cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be able to sell
everything, you know, it's cheaper because
[SPEAKER_03]: you get it for less.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to test it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have any responsibility.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything happens, whose is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, these, they're just
these little burner bodega stores,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, if I don't know, I feel like if,
if it would have continued under the model
[SPEAKER_03]: that was already kind of working,
they could have just incorporated
[SPEAKER_03]: everything like in California,
it could have stayed this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it would have made a working
model for other places too, to where,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, I don't know, that's, it's a,
it was a funny thought that I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand that there's,
it's a little bit more, it's a,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a little different than that,
but if you say, um, we legalized weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we legalized weed and we have a
huge problem with the black market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like just let that like soak into the
brain for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: We legalized weed, but there's a huge
problem with the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you legalize weed, how is there a black
market?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they didn't legalize weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They regulated it and they basically
supercharged the black market because
[SPEAKER_03]: there's so much incentive to be in the
black market and so little incentive to be
[SPEAKER_03]: legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they could have just taken what was
originally going on in California under
[SPEAKER_03]: 2015, everybody had incentive to go,
okay, this we're going to, we want to
[SPEAKER_03]: create clean, clean products because we
know that this is going to everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's basically a medical system,
but because cannabis is inherently
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal, regardless of any conditions
that you might have, you don't have to
[SPEAKER_03]: have anything wrong with you for cannabis
to be a medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you don't have to have anything wrong
with you for, for, for food or water or
[SPEAKER_03]: clean air to be medicinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're inherently medicinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, of course, everything can be
maybe a little bit out of, out of hand,
[SPEAKER_03]: but weed, surprisingly enough,
out of everything I've ever discovered in
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole world seems to be about the
least harmful to the majority of people
[SPEAKER_03]: who use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are like, oh, well it makes
some people be schizophrenic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, yeah, I believe that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like out of all the people who I know
who smoked weed and were crazy,
[SPEAKER_03]: they were fucking crazy and smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could also say like, you know,
potato chips cause schizophrenia because
[SPEAKER_03]: if you look at schizophrenic people,
there's 15% of them that they were eating
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of fucking potato chips,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like schizophrenia causes
schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just is not the right medicine for
schizophrenia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the best medicine for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because naturally it does make you
paranoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be, I could see how like that
wouldn't be, if you're schizophrenic,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're not like, Hey dude, smoke a bunch
of A's or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the greatest thing to do,
but probably likes maybe straight CBD weed
[SPEAKER_03]: might be really helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might find some novel cannabinoid
combinations that if you give them to
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody who is schizophrenic and you
believe the THC triggered it, you might
[SPEAKER_03]: discover that no, actually this is what
happened, but there's no real studies on
[SPEAKER_03]: that being done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's these little things that people
say is harmful about it, but overall it's
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee and caffeine can be really not
great for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: People die from tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just saw this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember who it was, but one of
these companies Panera or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: not to, you know, say that's who it was,
but it was a company like that had a
[SPEAKER_03]: really strong tea and they, it was
whatever, I can't remember what it was,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it was like, you know, 300 milligrams
in a cup and people are like, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they drink 12 cups and all of a sudden
they got a gram and a half or whatever of
[SPEAKER_03]: caffeine in their blood all at once and
they have heart failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's like, caffeine is just
completely unregulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy bottles and no-dos and you can
eat, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think the lethal dose of
aspirin is like 27 of the weak tablets or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's like 12 extra or whatever,
you know, and all these things,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're just like, they're, they're
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no big deal about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And weed was in a position where it was
basically like, you had a lot of incentive
[SPEAKER_03]: to go, okay, instead of doing anything
where I'm going to take this and I'm going
[SPEAKER_03]: to, I'm going to ship weed to Japan or
Singapore or whatever it was, it was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, I have stores that are around me and I
can take my weed and make sure it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: high quality and compete in a natural
American sense of true capitalism and
[SPEAKER_03]: bring it in and be like, do you want mine?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, no, it's not good
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, okay, I need to improve
my product.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to improve my marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to improve my attitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to improve the way I treat people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever the fuck's making your stuff not
sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be solved by doing good capitalism
the way you would with anything else that
[SPEAKER_03]: you were making, but they legalized it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they have a huge problem with the
black market.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really wasn't like a big thing at the
time of two 15, where it was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I will say that things had started to
get out of control, but I think they got
[SPEAKER_03]: out of control because there was only
these little tiny, you can't take the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole country and then just make it so
that it's actually like legal in just
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause what's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: California is going to become and remain
the huge production center that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: always been.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to dwarf everything and
everybody's going to go there as the
[SPEAKER_03]: source for this product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But have they actually gone, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was working in California seems to be
working pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody within your own state can all
sell the medical patients who is a medical
[SPEAKER_03]: patient, anybody who gets a benefit in
their health, mental or physical from
[SPEAKER_03]: consuming cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And who is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's almost everybody, as we were
already saying, except for possibly a very
[SPEAKER_03]: small minority of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And likely it's, we don't even know if
that's, if it's causation or correlation,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not necessarily determined.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, now you have this situation where
in New York, they're going through and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're busting all these shops and
there's all these different shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they were under a two 15 model,
all those shops would have already paid to
[SPEAKER_03]: have a shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would go, Oh, I mean, we'd prefer not
to get busted, but we can't jump through
[SPEAKER_03]: all the hoops of this, of this form of
legalization, which is this heavy
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they would have just modeled it in
the way of the working system we already
[SPEAKER_03]: had that was producing billions and
billions of dollars, then it would,
[SPEAKER_03]: they wouldn't be in the position they were
in now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would just have a bunch of mom and pop
bodegas who pay a licensing fee to carry
[SPEAKER_03]: products that have to be proven safe and
effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'd be able to have everything
work and it would just be a huge economy
[SPEAKER_03]: money machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would just be like, just going crazy in
all these States.
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead, this little bit of money
funnels to these big, uh, regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: agencies and everybody else who's involved
with that side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody is incentivized to have a
bodega and have it just be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're just going to sell shit until we get
busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they get shut down and they
probably go rent another place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll bet the bodegas that just got closed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll bet 20 to 80% of them will get rented
back out to new people who just set up
[SPEAKER_03]: weed shops in those same exact locations
and they'll just continue to bust them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll just be all goofy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas under the, like the, the model of
having medicine for everybody,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, regardless of whether,
Oh, you don't have to have cancer or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever it is that makes it a medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a medicine for pretty much everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go by, uh, Tylenol PM.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go by Theraflu.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go by aspirin.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go by all these things that are
like, yeah, they're give you liver
[SPEAKER_03]: failure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can die.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, they're, they're, they're,
they're, they're gnarly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're addictive in a real, uh,
real physically dependent way where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you actually really need these,
but everybody can get them everywhere and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's kind of all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, which of course now,
hopefully that's not what happens to weed
[SPEAKER_03]: where you have to be the aspirin company
to sell the weed, which is another step of
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation that now doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, I just think that was the real
problem in places like New York is that
[SPEAKER_03]: they legalize and everybody goes,
it's legal now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in reality, it's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's too much of a barrier to entry for
everybody to be able to have it be like it
[SPEAKER_03]: was legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we living here saw what it was like
when it was basically legal and the
[SPEAKER_03]: economy flourished, everybody was
involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was competition and capitalism
in a healthy way.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of collaboration.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of tears of prices.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of different things that
were going on and it kind of led to better
[SPEAKER_00]: weed farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farmers get paid better, better connection
with medicine, the same kind of community
[SPEAKER_00]: members coming in and guiding their
choices for what works with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and fresh weed coming in that you
could actually smell over the counter
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling pre rolls right then, um,
instead of it all just being packaged and
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting and distribution and, um,
and the farmers are losing the customers
[SPEAKER_00]: are losing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so who's benefiting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, look, while we're on the topic of
New York, I've seen an increasing number
[SPEAKER_01]: of photos over the past few weeks of some
very funky colored weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's come to the climax with,
uh, with you've seen a photo doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: rounds recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll flash it on the screen of what looks
like some artificial colored moon rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you guys have probably seen one
or more of these photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the question becomes, do you think
this is going to continue on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when moon rocks initially came
out, you could certainly say they were a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of a fad, you know, they didn't really
stay around for very long as a popular
[SPEAKER_01]: idea, but I have to say, I have seen more
and more of these are artificially infused
[SPEAKER_01]: nugs going around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to think that it's because
they've likewise been infused with the
[SPEAKER_01]: fake turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this going to be like the original moon
rocks and they'll fall off quickly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do we think this might be here to stay
because the, the turps sort of elevate it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that picture blurred out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's just too offensive to what's
happening right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I blurt out it's genitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genitals.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, is that, was that an
exposed anus?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it goes against community
guidelines for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wild, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really hideous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have seen a bunch of these videos
too, where you'll see a bunch of like
[SPEAKER_00]: pound bags in New York and like some will
be completely purple and kind of this blue
[SPEAKER_00]: and this yellowish like, yeah,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't, couldn't imagine having
anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think I don't know what's going
on or why.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, products, I think people just
naturally are like, Oh, let's try this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that weed right there,
you could have kind of used weed that you
[SPEAKER_03]: could probably buy for $40 a pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can throw that stuff on and
be like, I got a new thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it moves, you didn't really lose
very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're like, okay, let's go get
the rest of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just going to throw some more
garbage on here and make some more fancy
[SPEAKER_03]: garbage wheat, because like, you know,
I assume somebody bought that sack and
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody sold that sack.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a wild, it's a wild thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, over the years, I've seen people
do a lot of really silly stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've seen people, I've seen people
who really need a need a little,
[SPEAKER_03]: a little, you know, a little advantage or
they really need to come up real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen people do some, some trippy
stuff, you know, I've seen people make
[SPEAKER_03]: fake cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen, I've been, I can't remember if
I was, oh yeah, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say I sold fake cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was not sold fake cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in lots or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I was, I was down on hate street
when I was a teenager.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I was probably 14 or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we bought some fake acid and we ate
it, which of course could have been the
[SPEAKER_03]: dirtiest acid ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily it was fake and not bad because
that acid sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, then you, now you're just methed
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, killer clowns from outer space
and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we were, we were sold bad acid,
which like whatever acids, like five bucks
[SPEAKER_03]: a hit or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But we went back and we found this dude
and you know, we weren't happy with him
[SPEAKER_03]: and he wasn't comfortable with us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he gave us some cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this hash was like ground up shake
with like honey in it or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like these little grams that were
like little, you know, when you,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you make a square gram of hash in
your, in your hands or a little square of
[SPEAKER_03]: hash, you know, or a diamond or whatever,
they were little squares and they were
[SPEAKER_03]: just straight green.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, looked at them and like,
he didn't eat it up and smelled it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm all there's, this is like shake
and honey or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people are going to hustle.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people are going to,
people make, people make fake crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they take like, they take like
almond or a walnut and take the skin off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they put like ambisol on it so
that when people go to, to test it,
[SPEAKER_03]: it makes their tongue numb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, Oh, that's real crack
rock.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, by the time then
they're, they're not there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in Hawaii one time and I was buying
crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were trying to buy weed and we were at
Ho'okepa on the North Shore of Maui.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and my friend was like, Oh,
these guys got weed over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, I mean, you know,
you could check it out and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they showed it to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was like, it's really like really
resinous leaf, but, but it's weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's leaf, but like, you know,
butt shake, whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so he buys it for like 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we get it back and we open it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're like, this isn't weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had tons of trichomes, but they were
not, they weren't, they weren't capitate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had no nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just, they were just little
fuzz.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a plant that grows in Hawaii that
they call cuckoos and they sell it to
[SPEAKER_03]: people who don't know better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we went back to get the money
back from this, from this little,
[SPEAKER_03]: little Filipino dude, he goes,
Oh, you got to go get my, get your money
[SPEAKER_03]: from, my cousins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we look over and there's these dudes
sitting on a, at a picnic table down
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were all like 400 pounds and
super muscular, big old Hawaiian looking
[SPEAKER_03]: dudes, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were like, yeah, well, I looked at
my buddy and I go, Oh, it looked like you
[SPEAKER_03]: lost your 40 bucks, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we left, but like people always try to
figure out something to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's wild is imagine if you could
take the shake and put the honey in,
[SPEAKER_03]: in it and create a business and have it
actually take off and be a real thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's happening right now,
because bud has become so affordable.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's of a lower grade that people can
now go get stuff that's of a super low
[SPEAKER_03]: grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, Oh, well, the color's
off the smells off.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The color and the smell, guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Food coloring and spray turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now all of a sudden you're turning,
you know, $20 pounds into who cares what,
[SPEAKER_03]: who cares if it's an $80 pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are still like, dude, I got this
eighth and only cost me 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, and it's purple or this it's blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder what they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: What strand is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and it's, you just imagine like
the weird scam economy now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you don't have to sit at the
picnic table.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, keep up and sell cuckoos.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make a telegram and Instagram and
a Facebook and all these other things and
[SPEAKER_03]: reach all these people and go,
Hey, you needed the $40 sack of something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they actually get it and smoke
it, it's actually weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like not to us, it's not weed,
but to whoever bought it and couldn't get
[SPEAKER_03]: weed before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just got this on the internet
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, dude, we're smoking proper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, look, this shit's so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turned my hands blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turning your hand blue is the point
where I thought that no, we would go back
[SPEAKER_00]: for something, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it is a step above.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess like honey and oregano or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I just imagine that there's,
there's, there's a lot of people who like
[SPEAKER_03]: the standard of what is good weed was
like, dude, I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I was high, you know,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like very, I know you're waiting for
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like that's the, we used to have
a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was these people who, there was
these people who are selling weed at like
[SPEAKER_03]: Reggae on the river and the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, not, it was not very
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my buddy had this, had this Mexican
weed that was like really good for
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexican.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like people would think that it was,
we called it pretend to cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it, people thought it was like real,
real Cali weed, but it was not.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was like the kind of weed where if
you could have got it now and sprayed it
[SPEAKER_03]: would have been like, Oh, this is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is great weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just kinda, it didn't add up to what
we, what we thought was good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I used to joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was these, it came from this,
from these guys sitting in a parking lot
[SPEAKER_03]: and they had this weed and they were
selling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just like very, the quality was
like, it was just like, this weed was just
[SPEAKER_03]: dubious.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're just like, you just look
at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just wonder like, what,
what are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is, what is this weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, my joke was, you know, for a little
bit more than you're going to pay for
[SPEAKER_03]: that, I can get you something that's
definitely weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's, that's the thing about this
weed, even though like, yeah, it's blue,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's sprayed, it's got this, it's got
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's definitely weed and people
get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, Oh shit, this is
definitely weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: As opposed to like, you know, some weed
that I obviously have been, I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: there on multiple occasions where we got
some weed and it was like, I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: weed, but these guys, they're getting
something that's definitely weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's blue, but it's definitely
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an upgrade.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a good slogan.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100% guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just like, sometimes it's
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those, those, these people who are
buying this stuff, I'm sure a certain,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a certain amount of people who are
just like, depending on where you're at,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're like, dude, at least it was weed,
you know, at least it wasn't like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, whatever, whatever else it could
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe we need to actually wrangle
one of these buds down and get Mr. Gene to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the guinea pig for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I definitely, uh, I definitely,
uh, yeah, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well onto our next story.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a good one right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure many people have seen the
post, but, uh, basically seven 10 has come
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: With, uh, quite a damning post about how
they sent the same herb to five different
[SPEAKER_01]: Californian labs and got widely varying
results from 14% THC at the lowest through
[SPEAKER_01]: to 24% at the highest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me flash the right image.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so despite the same plant and the same
batch of nugs being sent out, they got
[SPEAKER_01]: widely varying results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is on a background of the already
suspicious variation between cannabis labs
[SPEAKER_01]: along with wildly outrageous numbers
posted from time to time, including the
[SPEAKER_01]: infamous state flower headband 41%,
which we discussed in prior episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, this largely confirms what people
have suspected that not only do you get a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge variation in the testing of weed from
one lab to another, but also that there
[SPEAKER_01]: may be components of pay to play or
corruption at hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Given that THC sells weed, how rampant do
we think this problem is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we think that we can really trust the
values on a cannabis jar that we see?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start off with Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just would expect to like both those
numbers to be doubled with the way testing
[SPEAKER_00]: has been like everything's 40% now all of
a sudden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, I, yeah, that's a,
that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's multiple things that could be
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it definitely seems like THC
levels has got like higher and higher
[SPEAKER_00]: cause that's what needed to happen on the,
to sell on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you couldn't even be below 25%
or something, uh, and have it move on the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelf, which is just insanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's not just like the believing
the numbers, but that concept of it
[SPEAKER_00]: needing to be a super high THC for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's, it's super useful for
people to know for certain medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also goes with, um, good hash
producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to be higher in THC in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see different varieties that have,
have that, but it, uh, to, to have it be
[SPEAKER_00]: 14 to 24, I'm surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that certain labs are testing
that low still, I guess that that gives me
[SPEAKER_00]: some hope, even though it's so,
so varying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't have any experience paying for
something or like knowing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've seen a lot of tests that were
actually quite high that had multiple,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, labs test them and it still was high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, I don't know if the
protocols of the test, did they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: did they give, what other information did
they give on that sample?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and what, what testing do they think
is correct on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they didn't really state who out
of all the tests they feel is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just stated, they just sent the same
buds from the same plant, the same harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: to four different labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does point to what you're talking
about, that the individual protocolization
[SPEAKER_01]: of each lab clearly has some effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if, you know, we probably not
going to say it's the entire reason for
[SPEAKER_01]: the variability, but it has to be at least
one of a multifactorial sort of picture
[SPEAKER_01]: about what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess the thing that I was
interested in is sort of asking the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the follow-up question about it,
which is that, um, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people have been quite vocally critic
critical of, uh, the purple pro,
[SPEAKER_01]: the little handheld modular THC testing
unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that, uh, I've used one in the
past mean genes use one in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some people out there who have
been very skeptical, if not outright
[SPEAKER_01]: critical of the accuracy of this unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, these results seem to indicate
what it is, which is that they fall within
[SPEAKER_01]: the same range that the purple pro often
gives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know, for example,
I've never seen the purple give like 30%
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it does often give results between
18 and 26%, you know, depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me think what, what can we trust
with the labs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is such a variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you even know which one to go by?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we do need some sort of
standardization across the board where all
[SPEAKER_01]: labs and I'm sure that they do to an
extent, but there would still be
[SPEAKER_01]: variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then finally, you know,
I, I still think that the purple pro is
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, you know, use it a lot and then
average the results, but it does beg the
[SPEAKER_01]: question, you know, what's accurate
testing at this stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for accuracy, um, and just like
knowing labs, one of the things that I did
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years was test multiple different
clones from different farms, the same
[SPEAKER_00]: clone at different farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did this, this one where it was
actually kind of designed as a showing
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir in different locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, one was like in the forest with
Bryson forest farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another was a dry farmed, um, in Shively
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, high water farms and then out in
the mountains at moon, um, moon made
[SPEAKER_00]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did four of the, of similar
varieties for multiple years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, uh, went to Samantha Miller with
pure analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though they were all just
numbered and went in different,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the results were, I could look at them
and I immediately knew like, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that is, that's Harla Sue,
that's black dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cherry lime dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Mandarin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the terpene percentages were so
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about like a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the, the cannabinoids were so close
year after year and of the same different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could see slightly different meaning
things from the different, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: actual places that they were grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe the, a slight more,
uh, CBD or terpenoline and the Bryson
[SPEAKER_00]: forest farm area a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: More THC, uh, in the mountains,
a little more kerifilene and humulene and
[SPEAKER_00]: Shively area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were all really so similar that
it was like, wow, this, this testing is
[SPEAKER_00]: quite accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to see something three years of five
different varieties grown on, on the
[SPEAKER_00]: different farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them fell exactly where they're
supposed to be from knowing that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: over all those years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, exactly 20 to one, um, uh,
CBD on the Harla Sue with 0.5% CBD V and
[SPEAKER_00]: to get that each time, multiple years,
I think is accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these labs absolutely can do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you turn something into just a
complete business and all that matters is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have enough THC to make it go on
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and at dispensaries, then it's
probably not going to be as accurate
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore because it's become a business
instead of science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it makes me wonder too,
like, okay, so if you, they do five
[SPEAKER_03]: different labs, you know, like from like a
scientific perspective, you go,
[SPEAKER_03]: okay, so what, what happens if you give
five samples to each of the five labs that
[SPEAKER_03]: would the labs still, would the 14.4 lab
produce the 14.4 result every time if you
[SPEAKER_03]: have them do terpene testing, would they
show you the same exact fingerprint of
[SPEAKER_03]: ratios of, of what it is every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like with what you're saying, Jesse is
that you're, you're essentially testing
[SPEAKER_03]: the lab as they're testing the weed
because you are submitting these samples,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are actually showing, you know,
like that that's actually a scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what you were doing because I
already know what they should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like happened to fall right in
there, even though it was totally blind
[SPEAKER_00]: going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't just look and go, Oh,
wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was gelato 41.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it should be right around in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: 31.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go ahead and just write that in,
you know, like we'll just, we'll just
[SPEAKER_03]: metric wizard it, you know, and just
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, and then I, I recently read a
couple things like the SC labs put up and
[SPEAKER_03]: it seems like they have kind of dropped
the hammer.
[SPEAKER_03]: On labs as far as making them go through a
lot more standardization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I don't know if that would be
different now or if those results that we
[SPEAKER_03]: just saw, if that was done now after this
so-called standardization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I'm a little curious about that
too, but, uh, as far as the purple pro
[SPEAKER_03]: goes, when I used it, what I had was I
had, uh, grape soda skunks and I had a few
[SPEAKER_03]: different other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, we tested some various things that I
kind of knew roughly, like this is a high
[SPEAKER_03]: THC plan and this isn't and whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we were able to see like,
Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 24%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: 21% and test it three or four times and
see that and then go, okay, now let's jump
[SPEAKER_03]: to this plan over here and see what that
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were doing like grape soda skunks
that I knew from having smoked ones in the
[SPEAKER_03]: population and none of them got me high,
but all of them made me feel good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, these seem, and I had seen
tests from labs for a couple of the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: over the years where it was like some of
the pina and some of the grape soda skunks
[SPEAKER_03]: that have the real purple stems and a
certain type of throwback plant to a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain part of the, that the heritage in
it, it was like, okay, these are just CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was able to go, okay,
let's take the green pina.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's more of like kind of a super silver
hazy looking thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's test this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, and I was sitting there with
skunk tack and I'm like, this one should
[SPEAKER_03]: say THC and you put it in and it comes up
and it's like high teens, low twenties,
[SPEAKER_03]: high teens, low twenties.
[SPEAKER_03]: You keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm like, okay, this should be
the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one like this, and then go,
okay, now here's these grape soda skunks
[SPEAKER_03]: that I know these and then do them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's like 15% CBD, 17% CBD,
13% CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just all CBD and lower than 3%
THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically non-detectable and then go,
okay, now let's test Mr. Bob's Puck BC2
[SPEAKER_03]: and then test that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like 25% THC and then test it
again, 23% THC, you know, grinding up new
[SPEAKER_03]: samples of the same bud and seeing,
and you do, when you do it like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like undeniable that there's a
certain level of accuracy because
[SPEAKER_03]: otherwise it would be like, now let's jump
back to the grape soda skunk we just
[SPEAKER_03]: tested and now it's gonna say that it's
21% THC, no CBD, but nope, we're right
[SPEAKER_03]: back in here, 14% CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by doing it like that, I was able to
go, wow, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how accurate it is as far
as being able to tell you there's this
[SPEAKER_03]: much of this in it, but it was useful for
me to be able to go, okay, so these grape
[SPEAKER_03]: soda skunk, this population has become
true breeding for CBD dominance.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me, that was valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't need to know if it has 8% or 22%
and whatever it is, it's more about like
[SPEAKER_03]: that profile of knowing the ratios.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this CBD weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it THC weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it one-to-one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it two-to-one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever it is, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for me, the Purple Pro was plenty
useful to be worth the price tag,
[SPEAKER_03]: which the plants that we tested that day,
they paid for it right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: At a regular lab, just to know the ratios,
but that was because of what it was for me
[SPEAKER_03]: to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say like if you have a store
that you should test with that,
[SPEAKER_03]: but as like a breeder who just wants to
know, did we go CBD?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did we go THC?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe you could probably reverse your
males and see what the, especially if you
[SPEAKER_03]: were careful and you pulled off the most
resinous parts and put it in there as long
[SPEAKER_03]: as you can get above the 3%, which is the
floor on what they test for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Below 3 THC, it doesn't show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Below 3 CBD, it doesn't show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you can get, like if you could
reverse your males and you were trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: do like CBD or THC work, you could go,
okay, well, this male, it doesn't show any
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD, but it shows a decent amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either way, you could figure that out and
it could be useful for that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know about like real specific
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I know too that the way that it
works is basically accessing a database of
[SPEAKER_03]: known numbers, which it's been,
it's like the correlation to what these
[SPEAKER_03]: tests that were already done using more
traditional standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it goes, okay, well, when the
laser hits this, it gave us this profile,
[SPEAKER_03]: this whatever it was, this little graph of
light, of whatever it was, the reflection
[SPEAKER_03]: off of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is something that always is 23%
in the labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's also gonna be reliant on previous
lab numbers, as I understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the labs were super inflated,
then the way it works could also maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: inflate everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit as far as I know,
cause it's not actually testing the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's finding a light signature from the
reflection off of the weed and correlating
[SPEAKER_03]: it with known data from previously
collected samples that were tested in a
[SPEAKER_03]: real lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as far as I know, I think it's
like comes from mineral testing technology
[SPEAKER_03]: where you can say, oh, when the laser hits
this and comes back like this,
[SPEAKER_03]: we know that this is whatever this,
this is these certain minerals,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is opal, this is a diamond,
this is whatever that they use.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what it originally came
from, but I'm not positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think I remember that at some
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that could skew everything to having
these previous data and that's what it's
[SPEAKER_03]: running on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as a cool tool, like I want
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only reason I don't have one at
this point is because I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: spend the money on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't use that kind of data that
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can see from, if you hear my
story, I'm like, this Pina is high THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Test it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's high THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: This grape soda skunk, super resinous,
doesn't get me high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's high CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Test it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's high CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I didn't really learn anything,
but it did tell me what was going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could be cool for things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, like reversed males where
you're actually like, okay, I managed to
[SPEAKER_03]: collect enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of this actual material that had a lot of
resin that I can get above the 3%
[SPEAKER_03]: threshold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I can see what the ratio is on a
male or there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see really good uses for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, what about just sending in the leaf
sample of a top of a male to a lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: then figuring out your ratio from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you multiply it by 10, it gives you
a little idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, all that's always perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the matter of that has a cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like for me, if I can go ahead and buy
this thing and it costs, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a couple of grand, and then I'm going to
sit here and go and test a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it would be really useful for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see that being like a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like you said, you know, whatever it
is, I think you, your plant gets to be
[SPEAKER_03]: what?
[SPEAKER_03]: 80 days old.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point it has a certain ratio
the lab can detect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you basically just figure it was
1% THC and 2% CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, you got a 10 and 20,
if it's around a hundred days or 80 days,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that how that works?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's pretty basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then when I do that, like if I have a
super cool lab and they're giving me a
[SPEAKER_03]: great deal, as soon as I go ahead and test
a certain amount, like I'm at this,
[SPEAKER_03]: I I've spent this much money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with like the, the purple pro it
like, it just continues to work and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no real resources and use.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just keeps on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can test so many, you know,
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reversing males is a bit of effort,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, but like, like Shawbud at 707 Seat
Bank, he just reverses all his males.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have, if you have like,
I have like several males that I'm,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm growing, I'm growing the progeny from
them, which I kind of would want to do
[SPEAKER_03]: anyway, even if I had already smelled it
and knew that it was pretty good and knew
[SPEAKER_03]: that I still want to see like what passes
and what it worked with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for me, it's not like as attractive
of a thing, just because I'm always going
[SPEAKER_03]: to do the rest of the work anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like the sex testing thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I'm going to grow the man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to grow them till they're males,
no matter what.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it never has worked for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works for different people in different
situations, but it would still be neat to
[SPEAKER_03]: go like right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a cloned, a live pop Kush male from
last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a cloned grape soda skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a cloned Meyer Lemsky, like some
new clones that I just took last year and
[SPEAKER_03]: I made stuff with them and I'm already
growing the seeds from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now, while I have copies of
them, it'd be easy to set some aside and
[SPEAKER_03]: then go ahead and go like test all of them
at the same stage and go, Whoa,
[SPEAKER_03]: this one's like really high in THC or like
the grape soda skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have like a bunch of the males and I
went ahead and just took a clone off each
[SPEAKER_03]: and reversed them, then I could go,
these are all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all CBD dominant, but wow,
this male is producing 6% and the rest
[SPEAKER_03]: aren't even registering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it would be like, this one makes a
lot of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And among males that could be more useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause for me with females, it's all about
how good they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really care about the lab result.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's interesting to see the reason
why I like it might have a correlation
[SPEAKER_03]: with some kind of chemical, but as far as
whether or not it's a valuable plant or a
[SPEAKER_03]: keeper, I'm going to do all that by just
being like, I like the plant and I won't
[SPEAKER_03]: change my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone goes, dude, that plant you said
was so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only 11% THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be like, 11% is some killer
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just learned from the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to learn anything from the
lab results, but there's still a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: cool things to do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, beyond all of these things,
I think that's the utility of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hella fun to test.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just sit there and you grind it up and
you go, oh, and then it gives you a number
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's kind of just like a video game or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just, Hey, a number, a number.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's something for your brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're like 13%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let's do another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then seeing the target and seeing how
it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was kind of just neat, like knowing
that somebody made this really trippy
[SPEAKER_03]: invention and that regardless of whether
or not it's like super accurate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, well, it's right here on my
kitchen table.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is pretty, pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, hit my dopamine receptors in,
in just the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, while we're on the topic of
percentages and, uh, Terps, that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: works very nicely with our next topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to turn on your light and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'll have to flash back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, uh, we are slowly disappearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were, you know, burning the candle oil
in the midnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but onto our next story, uh,
JBZ recently put up a post saying the way
[SPEAKER_01]: to set yourself apart in the current
market is to dial in your post harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: process and to preserve those Terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds fairly straightforward,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess what it shows is that clearly
this is an area where others could be
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this one of the big sticking points for
small companies that are struggling to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a crack in the market, or is this
more a message targeted for larger
[SPEAKER_01]: companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your SOP summarized?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to throw it over to me and Gene
first quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, well, uh, like if I was a Viking right
now, and I knew where to go, like find
[SPEAKER_03]: unicorn horns, I'd be like, dude,
don't tell everybody this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're ruining it for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is like a huge part of how all
of it, um, how all of it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if, if you grow weed and you know,
people who grow weed, you've seen a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people who, um, they grow weed and they
don't really do anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you go over there and you look at
their weed and it's almost done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, wow, this is one of the
best grows I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they say, Hey, I got some weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you tell yourself, Hey, we got this
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you see it and you go,
what happened here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, how did we get from there to here?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's so many places to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, um, basically harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: People say post harvest, but it's
actually, also the actual harvest timing
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You really want to know a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I grew a clone, I like to like cut
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I, if I have multiple ones,
I'm, I want to harvest them over across
[SPEAKER_03]: the window, a little time span to see
differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I only have one plant of it,
I like to cut part of the plant and then
[SPEAKER_03]: leave it and cut another part of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like to cut a little bit of what I
look at the plant and go, this is too
[SPEAKER_03]: early.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not supposed to cut it yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I like to leave a little bit of
it at the point where you go, don't leave
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to go bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like to have a few stages in
between.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by doing that, you can go,
Oh, this one gets better way later than I
[SPEAKER_03]: thought it was going to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it actually improved what I would have
normally thought the quality was just
[SPEAKER_03]: going to drop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with other ones, you might cut them
earlier than you would think would be what
[SPEAKER_03]: is ideal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I didn't, you know, even if it's
something you've previously grown and you
[SPEAKER_03]: try cutting it a little on the early side
or a little on the late side, you might
[SPEAKER_03]: discover that you've never seen this weed
the way it's supposed to be just harvest
[SPEAKER_03]: timing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once you cut it for harvest timing and
get it where you think it's perfect,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you've already done this, and you're
actually trying to produce this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like produce weed off this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then people put it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have a good room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people have a good room,
but they don't have enough room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it gets to the point and they
look at it and they go, this is dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they put it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they go, it's okay to put away.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to burp it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all right, because it's still going
to dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to finish this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to, we're going to leave all
the leaves on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to remove all the leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have green trimmed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to do well like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have all these different ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of cases, people are putting
the weed away thinking it's dry when it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Extra moisture leads to like very small
time composting of your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like fermentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's a little bit of extra moisture,
then you're going to have compounds being
[SPEAKER_03]: produced in your weed that should have
never been produced.
[SPEAKER_03]: And your weed is going to be sitting in
gases that are like alcohol based.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're not even going to be getting,
it's not sitting with what it's supposed
[SPEAKER_03]: to be sitting in.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's stuff that comes off a weed after
it's all the way dry that when the weed
[SPEAKER_03]: sits in it for a little bit, the weed is
getting like marinated in goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what you get when you have weed
and it's all the way dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the way perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you put it away and you let it sit for
two days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two weeks, two months, three years,
depending on what the weed is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have this weed in my fridge and it was
like some of the worst weed I've ever seen
[SPEAKER_03]: based on what my mind tells me about what
should be good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the opposite of when you see
something that looks like animal cookies
[SPEAKER_03]: or something really incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just look at it and you go,
oh, it's really drab and it has really
[SPEAKER_03]: dark red hair.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's not much visible resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like really plain and really
nothing to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've had it put away now for 15 years
in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now when you smoke it, it is the
tastiest weed to me that I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it must have been some kind of a haze
or other crazy equatorial thing hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you smoke it now, it's like you
smoked some kind of incense and it just
[SPEAKER_03]: completely sticks in your mouth and your
nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just, it's just everything is
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was because it's sad and sad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so post-harvest, it had a really
weird, you know, it wasn't like that for a
[SPEAKER_03]: while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it became like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what people say a lot of times
about things that are sativas that they
[SPEAKER_03]: get better with a cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I haven't seen that with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't have that many of them,
but in this case, it's definitely a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just is as good as it's ever been.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really common that people treat
everything the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like even me, I tend to tell you that
weed is the best when it's fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Curing weed to me is a little bit of a
myth.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does pay off in the case of certain
weird, especially like sativish type
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some things like, say if they have
tons of terpenolene, if you can like let
[SPEAKER_03]: the terpenolene off gas for like a whole
year at room temperature, then you'll pull
[SPEAKER_03]: out the weed and it'll be like,
oh, this has this, the craziest thing
[SPEAKER_03]: happens when it sits and it turns into
these new combinations of these chemicals
[SPEAKER_03]: sitting with each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you wind up with these crazy flavors
and smells that are amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people think, and it's kind
of, it's kind of something that happens to
[SPEAKER_03]: you, especially when you first start
growing, you think that if your weed gets
[SPEAKER_03]: too dry, it's going to ruin it,
but it can really only be ruined at a
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature high enough to evaporate off
the things you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if those things evaporated easily,
then they would never really make it to
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're smoking them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like for the most part, dry is not the
enemy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dry is only the enemy if it happens too
fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in places like Colorado, where there's
really low humidity, they have to really
[SPEAKER_03]: be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I lived in Colorado, I would have
humidifiers in my drying room.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I lived in Washington state,
I would have dehumidifiers in my drying
[SPEAKER_03]: room, because there's a sweet spot where
you want the weed to dry at a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens when it dries at a
certain rate, and I always tell people
[SPEAKER_03]: this, is your weed becomes tempered the
way that they temper steel using heat and
[SPEAKER_03]: quote like stone, they use heat treatment,
wood, they use heat treatment,
[SPEAKER_03]: kiln drying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's these different processes
that make things be stuck in the right
[SPEAKER_03]: state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they go too fast to that state,
or they go too slow to that sweet spot,
[SPEAKER_03]: then everything just gets fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you can actually have the right rate
of it drying, when it gets to a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: point of being dry, that's it for most
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to really get worse unless
it gets like heated up and sits in the
[SPEAKER_03]: sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not really going to get better
unless it has a really specific chemical
[SPEAKER_03]: profile that has things that actually
happen post harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they do exist, but it for the most
part, there's a thing that happens where
[SPEAKER_03]: your weed just gets perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can put it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ideally you need to put it away like
in a refrigerator or an air conditioned
[SPEAKER_03]: room where everything stays below 65 or
whatever it is to make it stay really
[SPEAKER_03]: nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can keep it, a lot of people
used to bury their weed in the ground in
[SPEAKER_03]: drums.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's a really wooded area and you
put your weed away, you can pull it out
[SPEAKER_03]: and it'll be like surprisingly fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you rush the process a tiny bit,
and you put it away with a tiny bit too
[SPEAKER_03]: much moisture, and we're talking a couple
percent here, we're talking like if it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just slightly too moist, then it'll go
bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you want to remove all the
moisture almost without removing any of
[SPEAKER_03]: the oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the process to do that is by having it
be slow and steady on the dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's too slow, then the moisture
hangs around too long in the beginning of
[SPEAKER_03]: the drying process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And does the same thing it would do if you
put it away when you thought it was dry
[SPEAKER_03]: later on in the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you also need to get it dry fast
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just dry it as slow as you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because it's going to dry too slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But back in the day, everybody always
thought if I leave it up and it gets too
[SPEAKER_03]: dry, it's going to be ruined.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what people would do is they'd
come in and they go, oh, the weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's too crispy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would panic and not realize like,
dude, open the door, put a fan in the
[SPEAKER_03]: door, wait till nighttime comes when the
humidity, not in Colorado, but here,
[SPEAKER_03]: when the humidity rises at night and that
fresh air blows in, you can go back in and
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll discover that, hey, now it's at the
point where it's as dry as it can get
[SPEAKER_03]: without falling apart and crumbling and
crushing in your hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now take it down, and then go take it
and put it wherever you have that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: most controlled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because a lot of times when you take
the big room full of weed and you put it
[SPEAKER_03]: all into being like these big,
big wires of weed and now you have it in
[SPEAKER_03]: bundles or whatever, you can take those
and you can fit them in an even maybe a
[SPEAKER_03]: better environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what a lot of people, they see that
done and they think that the name of the
[SPEAKER_03]: game is all, we've got to get it out of
here and put it in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you do that and it's a little bit
too moist, then same thing, too much
[SPEAKER_03]: moisture, it can't leave, it's all stuck
and then you get things spoiling again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people who really know what they're
doing can preserve their weed like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like I always call it scientific
grade.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, this is a specimen and this is
the closest thing to being perfectly
[SPEAKER_03]: preserved as we can get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas a lot of the weed, the most of the
weed you'll ever see in your life,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was either ruined 5%, it was ruined
10%, it was ruined 80%.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a certain level of quality that it
was when it was alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you fuck that up by cutting it
too early or cutting it too late.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you fuck that up by handling it
rough when you cut it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you fuck that up by not getting
it hung up and processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it becomes limp during the
processing stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you've just ruined it right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, you can ruin weed
before you ever hang it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it happened in a couple hours because
it was laying in a pile limp or whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then your weed becomes bruised and
gets messed up.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can cut all the leaves off and green
trim it when it's all the way fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you've just taken something that
was all enclosed and you've opened it up
[SPEAKER_03]: to where the juice that's inside the
plant, which is what you smell when you
[SPEAKER_03]: mow your lawn, that juice in the whole
handling process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if you were to be super careful and
you have the right weed with the right
[SPEAKER_03]: moisture content at harvest and it's crisp
enough, you can get away with green
[SPEAKER_03]: trimming your weed and having it come out
good enough to trick you into thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just as good as trimming it when it's
dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in most cases when people green trim,
that's not going to be the case because
[SPEAKER_03]: when you handle weed, you have to cut the
leaves off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you have to put it in a tub or grab
it as a big bundle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have all this juice that's
supposed to never come out of the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that's rich in chlorophyll and all this
other shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all going on to the weed on the
outside of the weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just not what you should have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like my analogy for it was always if you
take rose petals and you dry a rose hole
[SPEAKER_03]: and you pull them off, you get like
potpourri.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll smell like dried rose petals.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you dry a rose hole, it'll smell like
rose petals.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you take a rose and you chop up the
petals green and dry them, it'll just
[SPEAKER_03]: smell like vegetative matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's another place that people make
a big mistake during harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And between all those things that I've
mentioned, you can really like if you
[SPEAKER_03]: master all those little details,
you can make everything be really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you do those things and a number of
other things, I mean, trust me,
[SPEAKER_03]: I found lots of ways to ruin weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can dry in an area where you don't
realize your intake is pulling in wood
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke from your wood stove.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do all kinds of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: This year I had a leak in my room that I
didn't realize was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my humidity spiked so bad that a lot
of the weed that I had that was still in
[SPEAKER_03]: that particular room, it was all turning
in there and it wasn't as quality as it
[SPEAKER_03]: should have been.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just did that just now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And luckily it doesn't really matter to me
because I wasn't super attached and I
[SPEAKER_03]: already had the shopping bags full of
smoke for myself and I'm cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time I was like,
oh, that weed was really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's still way better than any of the
stuff you'll ever see with blue dye on it
[SPEAKER_03]: and whatever stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still like it's weed, but it's not
you know, it's never you can't like pull
[SPEAKER_03]: it out and go, this is what it should look
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can pull out weed and show people,
hey, I'll bet you've never seen what weed
[SPEAKER_03]: should look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's like, you know, like,
of course, my my fat kid analogies with I
[SPEAKER_03]: always say something about pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: But imagine like if you've all all the
time you've only ever had frozen pizza and
[SPEAKER_03]: then all of a sudden you went to like a
really, really good pizzeria and you got a
[SPEAKER_03]: piece of pizza, you'd be like,
oh, man, you know, like in that same
[SPEAKER_03]: place, not going to do the same business.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're selling the frozen pizza that
you go get at the supermarket,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just not the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you look at it, you go,
it's kind of the same thing, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what most people have with
their weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have something that is kind of the
same thing, but that little bit that
[SPEAKER_03]: separates it is a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the same in wine, food,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people who know know and people who
don't, it just doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people hate would hate the pizza at
the nice place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so fine have something for them,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you really want to be super
competitive, you have to know exactly what
[SPEAKER_03]: the finer details are of all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so JBZ is right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he should tell people and I shouldn't
tell people either because they start to
[SPEAKER_03]: close the gap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden, all these
people, it's like hash making.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now everybody knows how to make hash for a
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were like, dude, it's 250 a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've never seen nothing like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people were like, dude, look at this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now people are like, yeah,
everybody got a washing machine and a
[SPEAKER_03]: freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they find somebody who grows a cool
strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden, there's a lot of hash
makers that are making hash that 10 years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago, you would have been like,
whoa, that's crazy, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's just like, or I should say 15
years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a trip because it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: People learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's cool because people should have
the best weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to see people having the best
weed who are growing it and smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really want to see the mega corpse
go, oh, so wait a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the edge we need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luckily, it's hard for them to pull it off
anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to make sure that their mids
stay mids, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, keep mids mids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's a secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like, just cure it well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, speaking of that, I toured the
glass house spot one time and it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this money to grow all of this weed
and just huge production and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I see the dry room and it's just
pathetic and way too small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all of these huge greenhouses and you
don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see that that's been so pervasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout all the years, it's just like
grow all of this weed, all this into like
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how do you take care of it at the
end?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientific weed or scientific grade or
scientific grade?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, scientific grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see those jars like,
oh, that's a jar that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some jars somebody might want you to like,
oh, go in and pull that nug out and crunch
[SPEAKER_00]: it up and smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can see those jars are like,
oh, no, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that science grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I would only touch that with
like tweezers and pull out the like by the
[SPEAKER_00]: stem and observe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because not one trichome has been
damaged in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that somebody's taken that care
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that whole like indoor outdoor thing,
I think that's always been really like the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality is based on the end of the cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like indoor is better in a
certain way or it looks certain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's but maybe more care into that
that harvest and then to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing's damaged because you spent more
on it and it's a smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put on the line where nothing
else is touching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make sure that you don't do anything
to damage trichomes and you're not pre
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have it at a cool
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as long as it's like
between 50 and 60, both humidity and and
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, although right off the bat,
I always that first day or two go a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might do like 45 percent and then go to
50 and kick it right back to 55 and then
[SPEAKER_00]: have it hover right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep it in that like below 60,
50 and 60 the whole time temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less fluctuation you get in that
temperature, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you get it right at that
right point, and that's probably about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: percent moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nine percent safer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Putting away eight percent is going to be
really safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twelve percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have a little more terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to smoke it pretty quick
then.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't use the little packs that you
can get.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't say the name, but you put them in
there and they keep your weeds 60 percent
[SPEAKER_03]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a real question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that why it's always squishy and brown?
[SPEAKER_03]: I always wondered about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't use those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, yeah, putting it into a jar and
putting it in the fridge at that point
[SPEAKER_00]: right where you got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think it's really about you get it
perfect and then you slow it down as much
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also to your point, too, there's
certain terpenolene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had some of the Athena Sue,
the Harla Sue Athena crosses from way back
[SPEAKER_00]: when I even had some sitting in a shelf
because it was so pretty and purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like almost like a flower bouquet,
like in just an old jar or something just
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking out off of its stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like a big three years later,
it still fully smelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so like dark purple, but certain
just sitting out completely certain
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They last a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, terpenolene is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think it's just getting to
that spot where you just put all that care
[SPEAKER_00]: into doing the least amount of damage to
it once you've grown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put it away dry enough to not
actually ferment and decompose and change
[SPEAKER_00]: colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You won three different years at the
Emerald Cut or third, second and first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine those entries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took a lot of care in like that Nug
was going to be your entry from the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you did everything because a lot of
people probably like, oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: this bag is pretty good and grab something
from an entry that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming you're like, that's the Nug.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take that down and I'm going
to put all that love into it because all
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to do is put in an ounce or
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you're you're choosing and hand
trimming each one of those by yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right at the point where it makes
sense to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what that process is like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holding the stem and then, you know,
you need to remove this leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to remove this leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when it's done, it's like it's
you know, it is a specimen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like if you you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you can go out and like go duck
hunting and and you know, shoot a duck and
[SPEAKER_03]: your dog goes and brings it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I like I don't hunt ducks,
but you know, if you actually wanted to
[SPEAKER_03]: get like a specimen for like, you know,
a museum and go, OK, we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: taxidermy this duck, then you're probably
going to go out and probably like net a
[SPEAKER_03]: duck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're going to figure out,
OK, how do you get, you know, you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to want to have it just wind up being
perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I say it's like scientific.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like you want this thing
that you just captured from nature to
[SPEAKER_03]: basically stay as close as you can get it
to being preserved perfectly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's like why the whole hash
movement now is so cool because they
[SPEAKER_03]: figured out all these tricks to make that
work to where you're you're basically
[SPEAKER_03]: capturing the heads and you're just
getting them and you're fit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, it's like people are
like, oh, you take it and you put it in
[SPEAKER_03]: here, you dry it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, now it's been dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: The weeds dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dry weed creates weed dust, green dust.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that they dry slower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things are different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, like you you do,
there's a certain amount of, of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: like off gassing and different stuff
that's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whereas when people take weed and they
just very carefully cut it fresh,
[SPEAKER_03]: remove everything, get get that resin away
from the weed as soon as possible and then
[SPEAKER_03]: put it by itself and then get it dried as
perfectly as possible, whether it's in a
[SPEAKER_03]: cold room and it's been microplained or
screened or whatever, or it's put in a
[SPEAKER_03]: freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like it's this is as good as you can
get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the same concept with flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can treat your flower like you're
trying to capture it like you would with
[SPEAKER_03]: hash, then it's like, oh, it's as clean as
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's handled minimally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you just want it all to be just
perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to ever let like,
you know, if I want to show you like the
[SPEAKER_03]: very best bud you'll ever see,
I have to go where it's standing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I have to grab the stem,
cut it underneath, flip it upside down
[SPEAKER_03]: without touching anything, and then hang
it up on something without ever touching
[SPEAKER_03]: anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I take it off the hanger,
I'm not going to touch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to touch anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my scissors are only going to touch it
in the place where I'm actually doing a
[SPEAKER_03]: removal of some piece of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all said and done, you just wind
up with this thing and it looks exactly as
[SPEAKER_03]: it should.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's totally preserved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by having weed that's like that,
people don't see weed that's like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not what you wind up getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that that's just the mechanical
handling of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That has nothing to do with the
environmental factors that cause it to be
[SPEAKER_03]: like I said, like be like a tempered
product, you know, and like all the weed
[SPEAKER_03]: that I've ever seen from you, I could look
right at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I knew how I know exactly what you
did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that you did all the stuff that I'm
describing because I look at it,
[SPEAKER_03]: color, smell, resin, everything about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look at it and you go, okay,
somebody who got this wanted to preserve
[SPEAKER_03]: what it was and they wanted to get it when
it was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first times I saw your weed,
you had like flats of jars and you open it
[SPEAKER_03]: up and you go, oh, I know exactly what it
is genetically because there's not it
[SPEAKER_03]: hasn't been taken down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even when we do our best, I'm sure
we're probably hitting like 80% or 83% or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, like they say in general with
plants like growing plants, it's likely
[SPEAKER_03]: that we only as humans, the way our brains
work, the way the world is, we probably
[SPEAKER_03]: only ever achieve a certain little
percentage of the potential of a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when we see something and we go,
oh, that's you nailed that nailing it is
[SPEAKER_03]: probably getting it like 30 or 40% as good
as it could be if we knew every single
[SPEAKER_03]: thing of trying to get this balance of
these minerals and giving it this enzyme
[SPEAKER_03]: and this amino acid and then putting it in
whatever, like a lower pressure
[SPEAKER_03]: environment, like growing it in half
gravity or we don't know, we only can do
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like, when we look at our weed,
we're like, yes, we nailed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a, and it's a, this is a 95,
this is a 83 and we're so stoked,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's like out of what we know and
they say that it's really likely that
[SPEAKER_03]: we've never actually genetically achieved
higher than probably like 20 or 30% of
[SPEAKER_03]: what plants can really do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's crazy to imagine like,
so what people keep making all these
[SPEAKER_03]: strides in growing where back in the day,
people are like, yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I got six ounces off a light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people were like, you need to get
a pound off a light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people were like a pound of
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be getting at least two pounds
of light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now people are like, no, two pounds of
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not that good, you know,
and like, it just keeps on going and
[SPEAKER_03]: going.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it gets at the point where it's
like, it's supposed to be like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, as far as we've seen,
we don't even, we don't even know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but at least you want to, you want to do
what we know is good, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and not have it be mitts, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day, I was about to say one day we'll
get to like the 49 day five kilo blue drip
[SPEAKER_01]: or you suck at growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then that'll be mitts.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, all diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said scientific grade, but it's also
artist grade because like just putting
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of love and intention into
something and sculpting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just that, that level of care of not
damaging and preserving the thing that you
[SPEAKER_00]: work towards and that plant can present.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I considered like active,
hands-on science to be as artistic of a
[SPEAKER_03]: pursuit as regular art.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I consider, I consider like really
engaged art to be as scientific as science
[SPEAKER_03]: is like doing anything artistic is very
scientific because it's, it's all cause
[SPEAKER_03]: and effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's taking note of what happened when
you did this, somebody who learns to
[SPEAKER_03]: sketch really well, they're a hundred
percent scientifically minded because they
[SPEAKER_03]: conduct the experiment and they have the
result and they observe it and they figure
[SPEAKER_03]: out what went right with it and what went
wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they do it again and they do it
again and they do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same thing with science.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you don't just, I mean,
of course, there's a lot of types of art
[SPEAKER_03]: that are just utility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a lot of types of science that
are just utility, but both at their finest
[SPEAKER_03]: level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that both of those levels are
basically the same process because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: all about trying to have a good idea,
execute it as well as you can,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then try to, you know, like you'd like
to innovate in a way that will take it
[SPEAKER_03]: higher and that you'll actually learn
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in both pursuits, if you have the good
fortune for them to really work out,
[SPEAKER_03]: then you're going to wind up with this
thing that everybody goes, whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And kind of like that wonder that's really
what like is the, like, I believe kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: that the whole point, like people are
like, what's the meaning of life?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, well, everybody knows,
you know, you're going to live.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know we're going to live.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think like everything is kind of like
all one big, one big thing, like one big
[SPEAKER_03]: blossoming flower or one big blossoming
mushroom, or those are just analogies of
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going on and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just trying to like experience
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you can do something that
actually gives you like that wonder of
[SPEAKER_03]: going, holy shit, that's like the universe
kind of like it's blossoming for a second,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might happen in like the tiny,
the tiny stuff or the big stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with like art and science,
both of them are like this thing where,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like you're experiencing it on
this, with this level of wonder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you've ever been like, you know,
super blasted on hallucinogenics or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, you kind of sit there and you
go, whoa, you're like this thing's
[SPEAKER_03]: happening, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And with, with like crazy art or science,
if somebody tells you about it,
[SPEAKER_03]: where you see it occur, it's the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this feeling of wonder, like,
and that's what magic is, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you, people always think like
magic is a dragon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Magic is like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, no, all this, there's all this
magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just constantly like, like,
you know, it's blossoming.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's blossoming, like a big giant corpse
flower sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see like a volcano go off and
sometimes it's blossoming, like a lilac
[SPEAKER_03]: where it just has all these tiny little
flowers and they're all in a big cluster.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't even really notice,
you just see this big thing and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: all this stuff happening inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, that's the whole thing of like
being really into a thing is to,
[SPEAKER_03]: is for like the wonder of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what you get when you,
when you have like something that you do
[SPEAKER_03]: on an artistic or scientific level,
in this case with the weed, you're just
[SPEAKER_03]: like, oh man, like this really worked and
it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you just have like a giant
massive grow and you're like, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything only gets three hours,
three days in the real drying room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're going to put it in tubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're going to burp it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're going to run it through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you've left, you've left that area of
wonder and you've moved into utility and
[SPEAKER_03]: utility has utility.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by definition, it doesn't have wonder,
you know, it's not, there's no magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, you've killed the fucking
magic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people need weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you really want to, you know,
look, Jesse's gone dark now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun's going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: My battery might die soon too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The magic and like everything,
like I'm just like, just wandering around
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's kind of a magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you've made these agreements
with these different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to grow here and you're going
to grow like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, and they just kind of,
end up doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some mint might want to take over
somewhere, but you're like, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is kind of the boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that starts to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all kinds of little things like that,
just all the magic in the soil or like
[SPEAKER_00]: making some beads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somebody grows them in Australia
and then they had the best luck with them
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's pretty, it's, it's all this
like wild magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the science is completely a part of
that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The constant observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how you were like talking about
like harvesting each different nugs at
[SPEAKER_00]: different times too, leaving some on and
seeing that point that's optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's all about production,
you're not going to actually innovate to
[SPEAKER_00]: that point that is a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're finding that it's always having the
wonder of observation to find hone
[SPEAKER_00]: something or just to know something
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets lost when it's just production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I think we can tell that your,
your battery is about to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe with that, we might wrap it up
for this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, a massive shout out and thank
you for our incredible guest, Jesse of
[SPEAKER_01]: BioVortex for joining myself and Mean Gene
for the third episode of Not In My Bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we wrap it up, any final words,
gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, don't forget the magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do things with love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yourself, Mr. Mean Gene?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, agreed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a lot to add to it,
except that, yeah, I mean, I think that's
[SPEAKER_03]: the, that's what sets stuff apart for,
you know, people to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also for you to enjoy it yourself as
you're trying to bring it to other people,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you have to have a level of
enthusiasm and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: enjoy what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it works out to, works out to
make everything better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my final message, plant more seeds,
smoke more sativas, how fitting it's gone
[SPEAKER_01]: completely black on Mr. Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with that one, we'll wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you all for the next one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
