[SPEAKER_01]: what up brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on the show again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you on what are you smoking on today?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny that you asked that nothing
yet, but what I'm gonna be smoking on is
[SPEAKER_02]: this It's earlier for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I usually try and time it right so it's
only five here but yeah, so what I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: be smoking on tonight is the it's
blockberry cross or excuse me,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the great cream cake 2.1 cross of
Blueberry frosting, but it's the number
[SPEAKER_02]: 11, you know, and it's all it's like candy
gas dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking insane So I posted it on my
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on there and it's so fucking good,
dude It tastes exactly the way it smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be smoking on that tonight,
but in the next two hours So once kids go
[SPEAKER_00]: down Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that the evening smokes always a
pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that great cream cake the one from
bloom?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's great cream great cream cake
2.1 and then I cross that with that
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry frosting and I think that's what
we talked about last time is I was trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to come up like some candy gas and So my
buddy party time farms sent me the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made a bunch of crosses with that and
then we just hunted a bunch of stuff with
[SPEAKER_02]: that and so the great cream 2.1 cross the
blueberry frosting number 11 is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: like the most I would say candy but it has
gas and so it's like Yeah, it has a oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's og kushbreath.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh gee kushbreath 2.1.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so it has that like og a little
bit in there, but it's mostly it's mostly
[SPEAKER_02]: candy But it has that gas to it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like the perfect combo But yeah,
so I'm gonna be smoking on that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dang good Can't wait to get you guys
some over there in Australia as a matter
[SPEAKER_00]: of fact Beautiful that that sounds lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's an absolute killer it's it's
cool that you touched on that point about
[SPEAKER_00]: the candy gas because In the episode where
we did the breeder Awards We we had a chat
[SPEAKER_00]: to Chris compound and he sort of said that
his prediction for the future Is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: candy gas is here to stay?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on the the future of
strains and flavors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you think we're heading?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll say this that certain like gas
strains that I've had It's just like all
[SPEAKER_02]: gas or cushioning certain strains that all
have some of them like they smell just
[SPEAKER_02]: super dank Right, but then when you smoke
them, they'll taste like an ashtray or
[SPEAKER_02]: something You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not I'm not talking about rosin or
anything like that But like I only smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: flour for the most part and so for me,
I'm like, all right You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just it doesn't it doesn't taste great
after the second or third.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you're like, alright So I think the
candy portion adds a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: sweetness or a little bit of flavor to it
That's like, you know, just I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of adds to the flavor So yeah,
I would say that candy gas might be the
[SPEAKER_02]: thing who knows what's gonna happen
There's literally only so many
[SPEAKER_02]: combinations we can come up with though,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: but like I think the candy gas for sure is
like a long-term a long-term winner
[SPEAKER_02]: because it takes away the the from the gas
portion It's not just you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: ashtray or whatever whatever I'm thinking,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It adds like a little bit of flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Yeah, for me like candy gas is
definitely the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all buckets, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially for what people want Yeah,
certainly and it feels like we're heading
[SPEAKER_00]: into this era where Potency is almost
becoming a secondary factor Whereas it
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be a lot of the focus for many
people and these days it's more about like
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that flavor right and if the
potency is lower That's almost okay
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know, like I want to hit it a
few times for that flavor Would you say
[SPEAKER_00]: you're sort of in agreeance with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you're talking about this because
I'm a big beer guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a big beer nerd, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a craft beer nerd and so some of my
favorite breweries will have like these
[SPEAKER_02]: seven point Percent something or others
and I'm like, I don't want that I want
[SPEAKER_02]: these five points something or others,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuz like I like to drink multiple beers
and I like to smoke multiple joints So I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to drink a triple IPA And get
faded off two of them right and then be
[SPEAKER_02]: hurting the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yes, I do agree with that I like to
smoke multiple joints I don't want to take
[SPEAKER_02]: two rips or three rips and then be in some
fucked up world where I'm tripping out You
[SPEAKER_02]: know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I like to smoke and I like to drink
and I like to chill and I like to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time I don't want to just do
like let me get as high as I want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like taking a shot of vodka or You
know what I mean or enjoying a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: glasses of wine, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely definitely I can relate
to
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I like to I like to chill I like
to have fun I like to drink and I like to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep it I like to keep the party going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to blackout.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't want to get you faded I
don't you know, I want to have fun and I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to enjoy it So yeah, I do agree with
that and I think that I was listening to
[SPEAKER_02]: this thing I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what was on but it was a
this from lumpies flowers and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about the guy from lumpies was
talking about You can always smoke more to
[SPEAKER_02]: get higher, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't change the flavor So he's
like I like to smoke things that have more
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor than I do to get what as opposed to
things with higher THC He's like I could
[SPEAKER_02]: always smoke more and get higher But if
i'm not enjoying the shit that i'm smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: on what's the point?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like dude bang on so he just said that
like exactly perfect So and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, it's exactly what like what I
say about craft beers as well as weed I
[SPEAKER_02]: want my uh abv and or thc to be lower so
that I can drink more than one or two or
[SPEAKER_02]: three and not be fucked the next Day So
yes, 100 agreed Yeah, that that's awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear that you're on that same page and
and I guess it does raise the question in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of you see a lot of these um Like
products manifesting in various forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a spray It might be like a
humidity bag, but they're all about like
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene infusion I wonder what effect you
think this is going to have on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's going to help promote
terpenes so that people can get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like better access to flavored sort of
stuff and like they're going to Become
[SPEAKER_00]: more of the school of thought you're
describing or do you think overall these
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of terpene modifying products are
maybe just a a way to fix up a sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: inferior product So I think those are like
artificial terpenes and I don't think they
[SPEAKER_02]: do much for the actual THC percent right
they don't do anything really so they're
[SPEAKER_02]: really just like uh From what I know of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't have a ton of research on
these things But like I just know that
[SPEAKER_02]: some people will spray like some booth
batches with Terpenes of whatever to make
[SPEAKER_02]: it like oh smells good, right,
but it's like booth So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly don't think that's a good way
like terpenes added to you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some some cartridges or something Maybe
makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because it gets like extracted but
like to add to flour No, I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: that's so I don't think that's the way
it's not it's not I don't think that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: way at all yeah, like it's an interesting
conundrum because like I tried to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it a lot in like the really
foundational elements and I thought well
[SPEAKER_00]: in an In a sense, I would be happy for
someone to smoke bud That's got more turps
[SPEAKER_00]: than less so to speak But I guess the
problem is is that it's not being done for
[SPEAKER_00]: that reason purely It's been done to try
to get like a higher ticket price,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not and so here's the thing like
whatever strain it is has its own natural
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene So if you're adding terpenes to
it, that means it doesn't already have
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're adding to it So it's already
it's not it's lacking terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, you're just selling booth
batches and you're trying to cover it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like You know, you're spraying it
with something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like spraying it with perfume.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it doesn't smell that way,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't it's not it's not gonna change
and I understand I think what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: asking is is to like there's that
Entourage effect or whatever with
[SPEAKER_02]: turpines, but I don't think it works if
it's sprayed on Versus their natural
[SPEAKER_02]: turpines, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think more than anything like what
you just said I think it's just adding a
[SPEAKER_02]: turpene to sell the bag to get a higher
ticket But I mean I could be wrong,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think that's the reason why people
do it and like no disrespect to anybody It
[SPEAKER_02]: has booth batches, but like if you're
doing that you're doing it for a reason,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if it was dank, dude, and it smelled
great Like why are you spraying it with
[SPEAKER_02]: turpines?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make any sense to me Yeah,
no, I get what you mean And I think I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be on the same page about like I
have my doubts about whether it would
[SPEAKER_00]: elicit the same Entourage effect for sure
So it leads us to this interesting realm
[SPEAKER_00]: that really is quite undiscussed in
cannabis Which is like this whole idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: like mixing and I guess the simplest sort
of way of Discussing this topic would be
[SPEAKER_00]: for the longest time, you know tobacco has
been mixed with cannabis and it's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: phased out What's your thoughts on tobacco
and cannabis out of curiosity?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good one I haven't done that in a
long time, but when I was a kid we used to
[SPEAKER_02]: it enhances it essentially so when I was a
kid This is I'm not gonna name yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like when I was a kid if I didn't have
any weed I had to like, you know jump on
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody else's Party real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get a little hit of like,
you know an ash bowl or something And I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't smoke cigarettes I would take a hit
of like a cigarette after that and it
[SPEAKER_02]: would enhance the effect, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would get me it would get me higher
than I should have been essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So To add to that Yeah, you would get
higher What my thoughts are on it is it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's up to you Like I think that's
big in in Europe and like it's not really
[SPEAKER_02]: huge here in the states that I know of but
like It'll definitely get you high as
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like so it depends what you're into like
I'm not into tobacco So I don't I don't I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't personally like it But I remember
doing that as a kid because I go take a
[SPEAKER_02]: puff off a cig and I'll be like,
all right now I'm faded.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's good or bad or what
but like It's just it's not for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I understand why people do it
like you get like it's it it's like a
[SPEAKER_02]: Enhancer if you will, you know what I mean
to add the tobacco so I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, very common in Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called spin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because you'll fucking yeah exactly
because you'll you'll probably get this
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you yeah, if you drink a couple
bottles of whatever a couple glasses of
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever and then you take a Drunk with
some buddies or even worse a blunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're gonna be famous You're
definitely gonna get the spins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah for me, I don't yeah, I'm more of
a purist guy but what I like to do
[SPEAKER_02]: personally is like I like to drink a
couple beers and And then smoke a joint
[SPEAKER_02]: and like that's like my perfect tie it
takes It's like a combo effect,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not nothing is too much,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I don't puke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't block out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love you know, all of a sudden I'm like
I'm stoked again on music.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like Having good times I can
conversate still it takes away like the
[SPEAKER_02]: social anxiety aspect of any weed it kind
of balances each other out and that's just
[SPEAKER_02]: my perfect little Cocktail, I guess if you
will but yeah to add the cigarette or the
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco portion Yeah, it's I think it
would definitely get you high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that Yeah, yeah look I wonder
if we'll ever get to the point where we
[SPEAKER_00]: have like this crazy sort of mixing
Protocol down and it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually everyone's smoking like amnesia
Hayes bud with blue dream turps with you
[SPEAKER_00]: know tobacco whatever like I wonder if
We're gonna distill it So so here's what I
[SPEAKER_02]: would do that's different from the
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would call it This is this is like me
when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would do solid tosses So that's what I
would call it because I would basically
[SPEAKER_02]: take a little chip off each bud And then I
pack it in a bong and I'll just take her
[SPEAKER_02]: just gnarly like yellow thick disgusting
smoke I just be faded like I was on acid
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was gnarly So I used to do that when I
was a kid But the salad tosses got to the
[SPEAKER_02]: point when I was older.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like it, man It's just like I
can't even differentiate You know what I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like to the point where I was
uncomfortable I was like this ain't that
[SPEAKER_02]: fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I kind of stick with like it's just
like for me like with a beer thing I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like, alright, I know what this thing does
for me I know what this thing does for me
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's like it's easier to gauge I don't
like to add all kinds of stuff But like I
[SPEAKER_02]: think as a as a younger person like you
want to experiment with like how far you
[SPEAKER_02]: can go What tastes like what what does
what to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for me like I just wanted to get
high as fuck when I was a kid So I would
[SPEAKER_02]: literally just put like, you know three or
four frickin Strains and back when I was a
[SPEAKER_02]: kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have names.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like Here's the next batch,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was totally different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have indica steva hybrid and
nothing no names.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just Dank or not and so like I
would keep so I used to sell I would sell
[SPEAKER_02]: bud, but I'll keep like the I'll go
through each batch and I'll keep like a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple like Favorite nugs from each batch
like that I thought were like the best
[SPEAKER_02]: looking ones now have this full fucking
Tupperware of all these different buds so
[SPEAKER_02]: like When I do those salad tosses,
I just be like randomly picking like four
[SPEAKER_02]: or five from all these random fucking
strains And who knew what they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they're sativas indica
dominants hybrids, whatever like I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: give a fuck either I was like just get
faded.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, anyways, um I'm gonna whip whip
that name out in front of all the homies
[SPEAKER_01]: with uh, no context Yeah, salad top boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you could do like with the joint
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love that so I think A lot of
people would be familiar with having heard
[SPEAKER_00]: the word super booth or the word
blockberry Uh, i'd love i'd love to get an
[SPEAKER_00]: account now that we're doing a standalone
episode What's the backstory on the
[SPEAKER_00]: blockberry?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it come to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it just came to be that I didn't
want to pay 150 for seeds So to be 100
[SPEAKER_02]: honest with everybody out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have any um Grand plans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't trying to be Anybody it was just
me paying for these seeds that were so
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive to me and like I had always
collected seeds for years, but I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know how to store them, right so like I
used to sell weed when I was a kid all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way up till I was an adult and like I
would save all these seeds and uh It got
[SPEAKER_02]: to a point where I tried to start popping
them, but they're all like dead
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So When I came back into the game I was
like, fuck dude, these things are 15
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars like we we used to throw these
things out now they're Charging us for
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was it was mind-boggling to me that
they would charge us for seeds and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, holy fuck So I started buying these
seed packs and I became somewhat of a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: junkie I was trying to collect all these
packs like pokemon or something and then I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like fuck this so the reason why that
blockberry came to be was because I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like Got a dope mail here Don't feel my
here and that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was literally nothing behind that
And so I was like i'm just going to shake
[SPEAKER_02]: these two up.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one smells like blueberry muffins.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one smells like rotten tangerines i'm
like It'll smell like some type of berry
[SPEAKER_02]: or something, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was like that was my thing and I
was like this one has great structure This
[SPEAKER_02]: one has great structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both look dope Boom, and so I just
crossed them and so um, I was like I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't want to waste anything either So
that was the other key thing since these
[SPEAKER_02]: were so expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even want to waste mails I was
like fuck dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta I gotta make this thing prolong
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just created that for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so um Then I sent the seeds I sent
some seeds to Jay because he and I were
[SPEAKER_02]: buddies on instagram and we trade seeds
back and forth before Uh way before
[SPEAKER_02]: anything else happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I sent him a couple seeds and then
he threw them in the back of his I think
[SPEAKER_02]: it was his basement back then and then uh,
and then he sent me pictures like holy
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck bro These things are blasting off and
then so from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I gotta pop these myself And like I
said, I think in our first, um podcast I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like without him dude, I probably I
don't know if I've ever even popped these
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds so He sent me a bunch of pics.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like damn dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing is cracking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was like fuck I need to pop these
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I popped five seeds, you know,
I had a uh, a shed So I popped in my
[SPEAKER_02]: little shed and like I think I had like
two or three mails a mutant and like by
[SPEAKER_02]: default I got my fucking breeder cut And I
was like stoked and I thought it was a
[SPEAKER_02]: male because it was just blasting off It
was like it was like the beast of the
[SPEAKER_02]: group And then uh, yeah, so that's how it
started man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and then mobile j or j He took
his cut and then he started like Marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: it and selling it in michigan and i'm in
california So he's it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we're half a country apart,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So he started doing his thing and then
that started taking off and I was like
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck dude I gotta I gotta see what's up
with these things So then that's when I
[SPEAKER_02]: started popping my seeds and that's when I
found my cut and then Eventually at some
[SPEAKER_02]: point I got um both the cuts He sent me
that um, I had it grown next to mine and I
[SPEAKER_02]: just liked mine better So I ended up
keeping mine But the super booth cut and
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody else's cut everybody else's pop
seeds that guy and os os os grown like
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody finds winners in that in that in
that uh in that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but yeah, that's how it started Wow,
what a what a really interesting story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to ask a few specifics there I mean
the first one is how would you describe
[SPEAKER_00]: the differences between the super booth
cut that circulates from mobile j versus
[SPEAKER_02]: your keeper cut of what we call blockberry
Yeah, yeah, so his is um, it's tighter
[SPEAKER_02]: node structure and it has Giant colas,
right because it has tighter node
[SPEAKER_02]: structure So that's his and it doesn't go
as purple and it doesn't stretch as much
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the key differences that I
noticed because I ran them both multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: times back to back And no matter what like
I don't care which one anybody prefers
[SPEAKER_02]: like It doesn't matter to me, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like all the all the phenos are like my
babies, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't I don't care which one you
prefer and then so mine The one that I
[SPEAKER_02]: chose it's basically It's a little bit
lankier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of it kind of uh took on more of
the black cherry punch um structure from
[SPEAKER_02]: from from the mom And it got darker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the other key thing is to me is
like the the breeder cut It goes more
[SPEAKER_02]: purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes like magenta.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even like purple It's like
magenta and if you can control all these
[SPEAKER_02]: factors, like the whole thing will go
magenta Um, and then the super booth cut
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't go all magenta.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the key differences is is that the
Block ray breeder cut will get a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit lankier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll stretch a little bit harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't have the giant two foot,
um colas, but it'll giant colas,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it won't be as um tight so the key
differences as well from that and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: part of the reason why I chose the breeder
cut I didn't keep the super booth cut
[SPEAKER_02]: because because um When you have giant
colas that are really tightly stacked it's
[SPEAKER_02]: harder to control with mold so i've heard
some people tell me that They're super
[SPEAKER_02]: booth cut molds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So It is what it is and I don't know what
they're doing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like everybody's everybody's
environment is different so But they both
[SPEAKER_02]: yielded super high.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both freaking smelled pretty much
exactly the same I I mean, I just I love
[SPEAKER_02]: them both dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's no reason why like anybody
wouldn't love them both unless they're
[SPEAKER_02]: like You know, they can be very picky but
like they're both they're both bangers
[SPEAKER_02]: bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they both test super high,
uh, apparently the super booth Washes
[SPEAKER_02]: really well the fucking blockberry wash as
well Um, it just it just comes out in a
[SPEAKER_02]: personal preference really but yeah,
those are the the key differences are the
[SPEAKER_02]: um The node spacing so for for instagram I
would say the super booth probably looks
[SPEAKER_02]: better in the sense of like you have these
giant fucking two foot colas that are just
[SPEAKER_02]: stacked You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then if you look at the breeder cut
it's purple or magenta and it's stacked
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not as like tightly node space
and It's just it's just a bigger more
[SPEAKER_02]: vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, man, it's it's really
splitting hairs and like I just so,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know To for for everybody else,
you know as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally just popped all kinds of new
Blockberry seeds all f1s, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So i'm finally searching for fucking that
f2 dude some so finally there everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: always oh When can I get some seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just did that right now probably like
a week ago So we're on to the f2s now i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: searching for this dope mail uh,
i'll probably cross it to my breeder cut
[SPEAKER_02]: unless I find just some crazy female out
of the uh, Out of the f1s, but most likely
[SPEAKER_02]: i'll do both but uh, yeah, so there's
gonna be some f2s coming Uh, that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean seeds for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so it's about time I know
everybody's talking shit and to me I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like does anybody really want this shit
like it's old in the sense of like I think
[SPEAKER_02]: I created these things and I don't even
know when it's Been years, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like does anybody still give a fuck
but like people still hit me up So i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like fuck might as well make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's finally on to that Yeah,
nice and is the goal to be able to like
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually line breed it to the point
where like you can offer it as like a A
[SPEAKER_00]: seed line that's like really consistent in
the outcome or is it more just to take it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the f2 and not necessarily go like
further?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, i'm trying to definitely make it to
where it's like My my key thing in in all
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding projects is to make it so you
don't have to pop 800 seeds to find a
[SPEAKER_02]: winner Like can you find a fucking
production strain within five or six
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: most likely not but that's my goal like I
want to make it to where like Everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: can find a winner because like you and I
were just talking about before this
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast started One to two seeds is not
going to give you an accurate
[SPEAKER_02]: representation as to what this line does
But what I want is like if you pop because
[SPEAKER_02]: like i'm a small tent guy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I started there I want every tent
guy And girl to be able to pop a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and find something that's dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want them to have like you
shouldn't have to buy 30 packs or bulk to
[SPEAKER_02]: find a winner in my eyes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I want it on to be for the
everyday person And that's my goal So what
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm looking for in that twos is i'm gonna
look for a fucking banger ass male That's
[SPEAKER_02]: like structurally pretty much the same
vigorous If not the same as as my
[SPEAKER_02]: blockberry or the super booth color,
etc Turpenes obviously huge Structure
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously huge and i'm gonna i'm gonna do
that but i'm gonna probably make multiples
[SPEAKER_02]: of them i'm gonna most likely i'm gonna
have multiple different phenotype crosses,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, so the goal will be for me is to
make sure that everybody has Consistency
[SPEAKER_02]: in the sense that like you're always gonna
find like four or five seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna have you're gonna have a
banger You're not gonna have to fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: hunt a thousand seeds to find that one gen
Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that sentiment And you you sort of
preempted my next question which was I
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed you put a post up the other day
and you were sort of referencing that Uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your best keepers like the
haliberry and the the blockberry came from
[SPEAKER_00]: all our five seeds Yep So is that sort of
the number you think is a good number like
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be able to find something from
around five seeds That's that's not even a
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not a that's just for me a personal
goal and like I said if you are if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: popping seeds in a tent and you're because
Let's be honest the people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: usually buying the bulk of the seeds are
people that are home growers The home
[SPEAKER_02]: growers don't have a giant facility to
grow fucking thousands of seeds and find
[SPEAKER_02]: this fucking winner and whittle them down
like they don't have that Like those are
[SPEAKER_02]: the people that are buying i'm trying to
i'm trying to make it so like everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: who's buying my seeds find something dope
and My point on that post was that I found
[SPEAKER_02]: all those Literally within five seeds
because I don't have I don't have a giant
[SPEAKER_02]: space I have a tiny little space in my
garage and then like I have other stuff To
[SPEAKER_02]: now but like when I found those I was just
like small-time home grower essentially,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I want to make sure that everybody
gets there's their money's worth and like
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw this post the other day Some
somebody popped a whole pack He didn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: any any to even sprout.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what the fuck dude Like so I
couldn't even imagine that like they
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't test their germ rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, i'm not trying to bag on anybody
But like I want to make sure a my shit
[SPEAKER_02]: pops and b like you get a fucking banger
at least a d Banger, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, that's my goal in breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make things better Versus
just hype on hype, but I will say this to
[SPEAKER_02]: my detriment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have done a couple high Process recently
and I don't know if they're gonna be good
[SPEAKER_02]: or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So i'm trying to test them beforehand,
but um Yeah, but that's my goal man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make it so it's like every
person out there buys a pack of seeds They
[SPEAKER_02]: can get something that at least decent
does it have to be full on production
[SPEAKER_02]: strain production strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean Does it yield to rely and does it
have all these fucking, you know boxes
[SPEAKER_02]: check may or may not right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But like will it yield fairly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll have fucking turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have power behind it We'll have you
know, the bag of fuel, etc, etc i'm trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to check as many boxes I can for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well look before we move on i'd love to
quickly ask, you know Because you sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: touched on it just there Tell us about
some of the upcoming hype on hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to know what you got in the
future Yeah, so we did um I teamed up with
[SPEAKER_02]: belief dan from belief.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did a chimera three cross of blockberry
Those are fems, but unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_02]: it didn't yield that many seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, we're trying that again So right
now I I sent him a bunch of clones and
[SPEAKER_02]: like he's gonna try and do it because he
just sent me the pollen so the pollen
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't give them that many things and um
So we have enough to test But i'm testing
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of those right now and then I
sent him a bunch of packs of tests as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing that So that's going to be
a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also sent him some clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to make some if it's viable
It's not a herm fest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's it's a banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll send that out to the masses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got that um, I did this thing
with um tsunami seeds when they did the
[SPEAKER_02]: animal tsunami So I I uh cross out
blockberry again didn't yield a shit ton
[SPEAKER_02]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So i'm hunting those Um, I did some uh
black, uh, or excuse me some cab junkie Um
[SPEAKER_02]: fem crosses I did a gmo cross with root
beer fem crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did some s1s blockberry to blockberry um
The other one It's a black cherry gelato
[SPEAKER_02]: cross a blockberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a babyota cross a blockberry So i've
got a lot of these I just got to hunt
[SPEAKER_02]: through them and then see if they're
viable because like the hard part is Is
[SPEAKER_02]: you can make all these crosses and it's
really no way to test them all,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you have to send them out to
testers, but the problem With testers is a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of these people just go they just go
sunny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they just throw them in there free I
don't know what they do with them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they don't hit you back man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they get the seeds, that's it So for
me what i've learned is i'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got to hunt them myself So whether
or not certain ones of these will be
[SPEAKER_02]: available or not will be based on me based
on myself Make sure they're not herm fest
[SPEAKER_02]: really and if they're good So yeah,
those are some of the some of the hyper
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses I guess there's probably some more
in there that I forgot, but those are the
[SPEAKER_02]: recent that's like the recent lot Yeah
Nice, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the chimeras, uh, certainly been
making a lot of waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So No, no surprises there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's probably going to be pretty
popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to my boy at a Tsunami as well,
dude that animal tsunami so far like that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit looks amazing, dude So that I think
that one's going to be like the one but
[SPEAKER_02]: anyways, but yeah The the chimera ones
also as well look great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I think the animal tsunami one's
going to be like That's gonna be that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's gonna be the one but we'll see
still young nice nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look you mentioned making The blockberry
f2s i'm going to use this as a sneaky spot
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a bit of shameless self-promotion
here You know, we already discussed this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully it's nothing too surprising
But um, you know, shout out to two dudes
[SPEAKER_00]: in australia wizard of os and os groan Who
were the two guys who were like clued in
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to grab a pack of the blockberry
f1s off you A few years ago and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do some f2s and i'd love to get
you some but my question is How how are
[SPEAKER_00]: you going to do the f2s?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you planning on just doing a straight
open?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollination or do you want to try to
whittle it down to maybe one select male
[SPEAKER_00]: and go from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your plans?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so basically the way I do it is I
it's it's just like anything else,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're you're like, um, you're a
breeder at some point So you got to look
[SPEAKER_02]: for genetic traits that you're looking for
or that you want Or it depends on what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, I want to have consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to have at least consistent,
um Obviously growth patterns Uh structure
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to do terpene profiles with
males You can you can kind of do them like
[SPEAKER_02]: someone will wreak obviously and we can do
like a stem row But it's it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: guaranteed but like you want to have like
bigger etc, etc, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like some of we some males will even
turn color So like it depends on what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me what i'm personally looking for
is I want to match Something because
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially what the f2s what i'm trying
to do is lock down exact traits that match
[SPEAKER_02]: up, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me the breeding Cut is a fucking
beast So I want to match that so I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: find something bigger for bigger structure
to structure Color to color turp to turp
[SPEAKER_02]: even though it's hard to deal with the
male and that's what I want to do So
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what i'm personally looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um in terms of your question in terms of
open pollination um I I won't do that
[SPEAKER_02]: personally but like If you just yeah,
I mean if you just want to do that just to
[SPEAKER_02]: make some seeds for yourself for sure 100%
there's Nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still hunt through you could have
thousands of seeds for free now,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you got like that genetic as a
backup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't I wouldn't tell anybody not
to do that But for me to try and sell so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's different, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to sell seeds i'm trying
to sell somebody the fact that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get something very similar to
what I have And it and it has to be
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me like I have to be a little bit
more um Rigorous in in my in my selections
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure that makes sense And and what
sort of plants do you think would in
[SPEAKER_00]: general pair well with blockberry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think like oh well, the
blockberry's got like the flavor so I pair
[SPEAKER_02]: with potency So, uh, that's a good
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will say this I my only thing is is
i'm literally trying to take everything
[SPEAKER_02]: blockberry Switch out turps and flavor
because the That's the only thing that I
[SPEAKER_02]: think is missing in the sense that Uh,
not everybody likes citrus, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like somebody like fuck blockberry that
tastes like fuck whatever tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So i'm like I get it Not everybody likes
vanilla.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody likes chocolate or
strawberry, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like what i'm trying to do is i'm
trying to swap out the turps So I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: make a full fucking gnarly heavy gas just
like earthy burnt rubber vibe With the
[SPEAKER_02]: same structure same yield same look right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take a fucking papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take an orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take a strawberry I want to take
the whole gamut that we have Hops,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take them all uh lemon um Pine
trees pine, whatever I want to take them
[SPEAKER_02]: all and just add it to the fucking
blockberry structure because like to me
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a guaranteed banger for
facilities because at this stage in our
[SPEAKER_02]: game at least here in california People
are closing down left and right and they
[SPEAKER_02]: need these unicorns, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they need these things to be able to
yield like a monster And they have to hit
[SPEAKER_02]: all these other boxes The problem is if
you have all these other hype strains a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of them Will hit a certain amount of
boxes, but they don't hit them all So i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to make it to where like every
single one of these are production strains
[SPEAKER_02]: and like that's my goal so if it can hit
different flavor profiles And different
[SPEAKER_02]: turf profiles, but keep the same structure
and look like I did with like the super
[SPEAKER_02]: kush, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a uh blockberry across the
triangle kush Dude, it's a it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: game changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like uh Triangle kush was never like a
giant stacking big it was more like
[SPEAKER_02]: satellite buzz like some Top knots,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: um But now mixing with a blockberry get
these fucking like like with super booth
[SPEAKER_02]: or or or whatever So super we get these
giant colas now That are stacked or
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking coated in crystals or you know
trichomes and now they have kush turps
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like bang dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all i'm trying to do So i'm trying
to i'm basically trying to create flavors
[SPEAKER_02]: for everybody with the same structure and
yield and color and bag appeal Etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that everybody can fucking grow it
everybody can be stoked on how much they
[SPEAKER_02]: yield because really it comes down to If
it's yielding One and a half a light
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody's going to grow that long term
unless it's just for the head stash Like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the prices are too low So like you
need to literally come as close to three
[SPEAKER_02]: light or more as possible So that's my
goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make it so every tent grower as
well every facility is like Bang on dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just change out these Fucking
turps, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because not everybody's gonna like
whatever so that's the goal I love it and
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that you dropped the the tk in the
mix there Uh, because I know that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: done some breeding old school,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to So first first question is what's
your favorite og?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, fuck dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the skywalker og for some fucking
reason dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always go back to that one I don't know
if you guys have ever had that out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's just like That's my go-to
Skywalker og That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the reason why I ask is because and
it's again good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the tk I noticed you've done
some breeding with the tk bx1 male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a bit about that Who'd that one
come from was it jungle boys?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, see junkie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So see junkie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that was like one of the first c packs
I ever bought I think I think the first
[SPEAKER_02]: two c packs I ever bought like bought
bought when I tried to do the same um was
[SPEAKER_02]: Oni seeds and it was like papaya og and it
was uh Sea junkie triangle kush bx1 And so
[SPEAKER_02]: those things have sat the longest in the
fridge, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, those are the ones that I was like
i'm just gonna throw in some dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how it goes And then it was outdoor
and I was like they got eaten alive by a
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking bug I was boof because it's you
know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the ones that I started with
um and then uh, my dog she actually she
[SPEAKER_02]: actually I had a bunch of the uh,
the sea junkie, uh triangle kush out there
[SPEAKER_02]: and she Fucking ate them all and like
ravaged them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, I think I only had like three
seeds left and so Towards the end so I I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't lie and say that I had a full You
know, uh pack or multiple packs that I got
[SPEAKER_02]: to hunt a male To do this cross with I
literally was stuck with like Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got this male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So i'm not trying to lie to anybody like
So I literally had this last male and I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like fuck dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I gotta use it Because it was it was
like my last three Seeds, so thanks to my
[SPEAKER_02]: dog Yeah, my dog getting the homework,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, yeah, dude that bitch so,
uh, I so I had to use that one and um
[SPEAKER_02]: Turns out it wasn't a bad male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a little bit It was a little
bit too tk for me in the sense that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: um If you grew tk a lot of it sometimes it
grows kind of lanky and like satellite
[SPEAKER_02]: buds So like I will have um some pinos for
each one of those crosses that are
[SPEAKER_02]: Traditional tk, which is not a bad thing
But like I personally would have wanted a
[SPEAKER_02]: little something different a little bit
more variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so No, that's interesting to
hear the backstory and part of the reason
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring it up is I see you did some
crosses with the soap and the emergency
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know You mentioned jbz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a bit about those crosses and the
mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you like them?
[SPEAKER_02]: The soap is fucking insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only problem with the soap is that
uh I've got barely any seeds and I And
[SPEAKER_02]: like I sold some to some seed Some seed
banks, but like I didn't have that many
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds But I pop some myself and the
fucking turps are amazing like they're so
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking good all gas obviously,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um So I love that one, but like it's not a
huge yielder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's It's on the triangle kush vibe,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a huge It's not it's not a
productions trainer from from what i've
[SPEAKER_02]: hunted right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I only hunted like, you know end seeds
or something So it's for me when I hunt
[SPEAKER_02]: the seeds I'm just trying to do proof of
concept because I don't have the room So
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm trying i'm trying to do proof of
concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure they're not herms Make sure I
don't have a fucking bunch of mutants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure that the germination rate is
right But anyways that soap on there dude
[SPEAKER_02]: for personal smokes fucking gas bro,
like it's banging Um, and it's beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: bro, but it doesn't I don't think it
washes well either So people are trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: get it for washers like it's oily as fuck
like you touch It's so greasy like but for
[SPEAKER_02]: me like I only smell flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So i'm like it's fucking dank,
dude It's like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it's hard to roll a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is so fucking greasy So for me,
it's like perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what was the other one you asked about
the emergency?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, so i've had uh, I haven't
popped any of those myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a bunch of testers and the emergency
is supposed to be fucking fire but like
[SPEAKER_02]: The only people that i've talked to that
have had it that have made it that have
[SPEAKER_02]: pulled it out and they're like showed me
it's it's it's like It has orange turps
[SPEAKER_02]: like I know a lot of people that They're
trying to do the tk crosses aren't down
[SPEAKER_02]: for the orange turps But there are the
underliers that aren't orange turps as and
[SPEAKER_02]: same with the emergencies like there are
some that are not orange turps They're
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are those underliers But the
emergency that I cross it with is such a
[SPEAKER_02]: beast dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a fucking giant Just monstrosity
just super vigorous heavy yields beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: plant Um, so if you don't hate orange
turps and you're willing to risk it dude,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a that's a big one for sure Ah,
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's good insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean You know while we're on the
topic of jbz there's been a lot of uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Sort of ripples in the industry
regarding jbz and then also, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: given the whole thing with cookies Do you
do you take any sides in that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do you see much of that whole thing
going down?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know anything about the um The
personal stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know that there was like on our
side over here on the on the states It was
[SPEAKER_02]: like it wasn't necessarily a cookies
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a uh glass house thing so like when
he Partnered with glass house like
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody Chose sides and they lost their
shit because the guy from glass house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's like a big Big deal out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the guy was I was an ex cop and
whatever Yeah, a lot of people lost their
[SPEAKER_02]: shit on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that one's more so like with
the Cookie stuff like I don't know man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume that burner is probably pretty
shady because like a lot of people talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about it and like No disrespect to
anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I assume that like you have to
Have your lawyers involved before you do
[SPEAKER_02]: anything with that guy because I don't
think he Plays by like, you know the same
[SPEAKER_02]: set of rules I think he changes the the
rules of the game as he goes and I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know what their situation is so I don't
know how to comment on it, but like based
[SPEAKER_02]: on from an outsider's perspective like
based on what I've seen like he seems to
[SPEAKER_02]: change the rules as it goes and that's
just I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's par for the course, man I'll
tell you this dude The unfortunate part of
[SPEAKER_02]: this whole industry is that there are a
lot of people that you can and cannot
[SPEAKER_02]: trust But you don't know until you go down
the road with them And so it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's kind of like funeral hunting for
partners in all honesty So it's it's hard
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this person is seems legit then at
the end of the game at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_02]: like they could screw you over like you
don't know so Yeah, I honestly don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: what they're Situation is behind it behind
closed doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I couldn't really comment but I would
say that the more important or the more I
[SPEAKER_02]: guess Controversial was the glass house
combo or and then and then and then
[SPEAKER_02]: Supposedly like that thing fizzled.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: But That's between all them right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't I don't really have an
opinion I'm just outsider just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I like to hear everybody side
before I choose right but I didn't hear
[SPEAKER_02]: over the inside so From Jay's busy
standpoint sounds like he got fucked over
[SPEAKER_02]: but I didn't hear everybody else's side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know Yeah, while we're on the
topic of the industry I was you know doing
[SPEAKER_00]: some research for this episode as I
generally do and when I was googling
[SPEAKER_00]: around I feel like I got the strong
impression that Blockberry has got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the most sold clones on the market
like in terms of like Everyone's offering
[SPEAKER_00]: Blockberry as a cutting for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that how does that play into what
you're doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that like oh, but that's
humbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how does it interplay with your
operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's amazing so for me my goal is
not to just make a shit ton of money and
[SPEAKER_02]: and fuck people over like my Initial goal
what like I said was just to make more
[SPEAKER_02]: seed for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my Impression to answer your question
is if that's the most sold clone like
[SPEAKER_02]: that's fucking awesome Because all I
really want to do with this whole strain
[SPEAKER_02]: is like share with everybody man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be known to supply something or
known to Add to the scene like I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to be a fucking just a money-grubbing
Give me money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like who dreamed fucking whatever,
you know five whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just want to be Here, this is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the world to have it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying I don't Right if you ask me
I'm gonna charge you for it because I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have so many but like to me like
yeah, dude That's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then like I've never heard this stat so
That's great, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it Yeah, look, I mean, it's it's
honestly just observation I could be
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong, but it seems like it's extremely
popular and I mean on that same note I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: love to ask you I saw a few companies they
were getting like really top dollar for
[SPEAKER_00]: For you know, they label it as Super Booth
super booth, but obviously it's blockberry
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found one notable instance where
there was a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like it was high quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were selling a quarter of Smalls for
$75 and I thought that's actually really
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's surprisingly good How does
that impact your your whole dynamic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you you stoked that like, you know,
it's able to command that sort of price?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and the crazy part is is that it's
been years since this came out So like
[SPEAKER_02]: certain people are like I'm tired of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But other people still haven't caught on
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the thing It's literally been an
underground slow roller slow player the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole time So she's been building and
building and building and so it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking amazing that it's still even in
the conversation to me And then to add to
[SPEAKER_02]: that if it commands anything like that's
amazing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuz like how many people go through so
many height strains or song to the next on
[SPEAKER_02]: to the next on to the next And this was
never a hype strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some random dude Fucking
California that everybody thinks is in
[SPEAKER_02]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like to me, that's fucking awesome To
me the fact that anybody is even talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about it anymore is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm Super stoked and like like I said,
man, my only thing is I want this shit to
[SPEAKER_02]: go out to the world Like I want everybody
to have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking It's a it's a production
strain, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you could literally like let me just
tell you something dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So side note side note I partner with this
company called Zen Leaf and They're
[SPEAKER_02]: they're legal here in California and like
they flat out told me like dude It's a
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking unicorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hits numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hits fucking weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all these things, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all these These these these these
these metrics that they that they account
[SPEAKER_02]: for and then like dude it adds However
much I'm not gonna say that however much
[SPEAKER_02]: but they adds however much to our bottom
end every month.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking insane So it brings people
back from the brink Like that's huge to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it's so humbling to hear that
like that's fucking amazing Like dude,
[SPEAKER_02]: trust me bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking unicorn whether or not you
like to you know, the the turps are one
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I'm still trying to look for
the other turps But yeah, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very humbling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to hear that it still commands anything
because it's been around to me for so long
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was 2019 when I made that so
what's it four years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I love it That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to ask, you know I had seen
in your stories it came across to me like
[SPEAKER_00]: there might have been at some point at
least a little bit of friction between you
[SPEAKER_00]: and mobile J and I wanted to just ask are
we reclaiming the name we trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of the Super Booth title and just get
a Blockberry once and for all or are we
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to let the Super Booth slide?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, it was always Blockberry was the
strain name.
[SPEAKER_02]: He changed his to Super Booth and we
talked about that in the first podcast and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like To me, that's just the cut But
it's never been the strain name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I'm not trying to regain anything
in the sense of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that's the that's his specific
cut is the Blockberry excuse me,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Super Booth cut of Blockberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, I'm just like asserting myself
in the sense of like it was never the
[SPEAKER_02]: strain was never Super Booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always Blockberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we never I never changed that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He changed it to Super Booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a little fucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, it's like my little
brother, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, fuck you like we're talking
shit to each other, which is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so the name itself, it's always
going to be Blockberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's there's no there's no talk
about that cut itself, you call it
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Super Booth cut or Blockberry,
it's game.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good on him and not I don't but yeah,
the strain name is never going to change
[SPEAKER_02]: his Blockberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not it's never been Super Booth but
never will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask what line that you've
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you most excited to work with next?
[SPEAKER_02]: So just what we're just talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just did here's something I just did
these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just did these Blockberry cross with
blueberry frosting and like what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: just talking about, this is all kind of
these, it all kind of melds together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I'm trying to find those blueberry
turps now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So initially, when I had the Black Cherry
Punch, the mom I had was full blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smelled like when it was on the vine,
it smelled like fucking artificial
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it cured, it smelled like
fucking blueberry bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so fucking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem was it didn't get you that
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of low in the teeth.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, it was like, it was like a
quick high and it kind of went away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just trying to get back to those
blueberry turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just did that blueberry frosting
cross to the Blockberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hunting those right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, I find something that has the
THC percentage as well as all the other
[SPEAKER_02]: attributes of the original Blockberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with a different turp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one that I'm very excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one I'm excited about is
obviously that Kamara.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Kamara has a shit ton of fucking IP on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just did a collab with Sea Junkie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's got his Sea Junkie collab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like Kermit, Kamara or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be riding on that heel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully those things turn out well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hopefully this one turns out
well, the Blockberry with the Kamara.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's another big one that I'm hyped
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say after all said and done,
what I've grown out and I've crossed is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be the Blockberry cross and
blueberry frosting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be probably my number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the number two will be the
Blockberry cross with the animal tsunami.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Tsunami Seeds, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that one's going to be a banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they already are looking fucking
insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything that I've known about the
animal tsunami, it's a fucking heavy,
[SPEAKER_02]: indica heavy, fucking gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a little sweet tone to it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can get that heavy sweet,
gassy note with the Blockberry structure,
[SPEAKER_02]: just to add a little bit of weight to it,
it'll be a fucking fire banger,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are probably the two most that
I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit about the Halle Berry
and the Block party.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I feel like I, you know,
the general public may be not so aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Halle Berry, that thing hasn't had
its time to shine yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Halle Berry is a cross between ice
cream cake and Blockberry, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I only made like 12 or 15 seeds or
something ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a, it was a reversal that didn't
take that well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like five seeds, I got my fucking
banger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the Halle Berry number three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what everybody has.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Halle Berry number three is a
fucking beast, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more vigorous than the Blockberry
Breeder cut, which is more vigorous than
[SPEAKER_02]: the SuperBoot cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the most vigorous plan I've ever had
and or made.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking giant Christmas tree,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It blasts off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have triplets or double stacks,
it's probably not good for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have no headroom issues,
it's a fucking beast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes full dark purple throughout
without any environmental attributes
[SPEAKER_02]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just does it genetically,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just is fucking super coated
in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has a cream saver turp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it tastes like, like it has a vanilla
from the ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the vanilla back, but on the on the
front side, it has like the Blockberry
[SPEAKER_02]: front.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like not full tangy, but it has
like an earthy kind of citrus vibe with a
[SPEAKER_02]: vanilla finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fucking so good, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like tasting a cream saver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then yields super heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the back, it looks fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's straight up it almost looks black.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it throws these giant donks like
fucking baby arm donks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just huge, heavy fucking colas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one just won in the ZOlympics in
Michigan for I think it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it was first or second place
for best turps and best bag of eel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was in it was in the top two for
each one of those categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was grown out by Ghost Budsters
in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave that to him a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And side note, on that he I don't know if
I should be telling people, but it's too
[SPEAKER_02]: late.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he he has the so Ghost Budsters took my
Blockberry my breeder cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Ray Kwan from Wu Tang Clan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's his signature strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my Blockberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Halleberry is Matt Barnes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like a basketball player,
ex basketball player.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's his signature strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all from Michigan, apparently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Royce the Five Nine has my Block
party as his signature strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's an he's a rapper.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, so so so that's the
Halleberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that thing just started getting going.
[SPEAKER_02]: That company that I talked to you about
earlier that I started with a partnership
[SPEAKER_02]: with with Zenly here in San Diego,
they are finally building out some moms,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just they just did a couple runs just
real quick to see if it would be viable
[SPEAKER_02]: for their system, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is and so now they're building out
the mom block.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna have a ton of Instagram
footage here probably the next three,
[SPEAKER_02]: four months of it and like people will
really get to see because like for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just you know, I don't have the
facilities and space to do like giant
[SPEAKER_02]: grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I only do a couple plants at a time,
but we'll be able to see soon like what it
[SPEAKER_02]: actually looks like on a production scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's it's bonkers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the that's the Halleberry and
then the block party was Super Sherb,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is it was a freebie from in house
genetics and it was a sunset Sherb cross a
[SPEAKER_02]: GMO and it might be backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure which one went first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was sunset Sherb cross a GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a freebie.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I popped a however, I think I got like
six or seven seeds of that as a freebie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found this one that was just like it was
gassy but it was like blueberry turps and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was it was it was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I use that one for the mom and then
some of them were like GMO they're kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like ugly long giant fucking colas it just
like they really smell great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't really taste great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I use that mom and then I'd same thing
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I did like a maybe 30 or 40 seeds
off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I only popped however many but
that's the block party.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the block party it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing dude from what I've
heard the I've never had this problem but
[SPEAKER_02]: the people that I've that I've sold clones
to like if it if it has wet pots
[SPEAKER_02]: consistently it won't grow giant dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only had these baseball bat dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like giant fucking heavy ass dogs but like
people have told me like oh it's not grown
[SPEAKER_02]: like they'll have these tiny little frosty
buds and like because they have these
[SPEAKER_02]: super wet pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that one's super nice dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: People love it or hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has like it's all gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a slight lemon I would say finish
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah that one's also awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So block party to me is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like if you don't grow right it's not
it's not it's not going to be it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Halle Berry is kind of like the
blockberry in the sense of like you can do
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the hell you want to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still going to be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to quickly pivot for a second
back to something you mentioned earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: where you were talking about you know some
of the high profile rappers and former NBA
[SPEAKER_00]: players having signature strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean by signature strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as in like that's the one they're
repping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow up do you think that this
sort of collabing between Big Name people
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the cannabis industry like what
we've seen already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's something that's going
to continue?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically come to big growers and big
facilities because they're doing business
[SPEAKER_02]: ventures right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not anything but marketing really.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're just trying to look for strains
that they like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they just want to attach their
name to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like boom it's this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like you know it's Wu Tang's
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know how to answer your
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the sense of like I don't know if it's
going to be a continued thing but I think
[SPEAKER_02]: it would be because it's always been like
let's go back a little bit like the
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like cookies they don't grow their weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they find local growers in whatever
area to where their dispensaries are at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they give them the strains and
they grow them and they buy them back for
[SPEAKER_02]: like a certain price that's negotiated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little bit behind the scenes
info.
[SPEAKER_02]: But same kind of vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just somebody just basically I mean
no offense anybody but it's like somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: is changing the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Adding their label to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of the way it works with
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know if it's going to be a
long term thing or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they continue to do it
after a while or what.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you probably know the weed game has
a lot to do with hype right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a big time whoever you know
saying hey this is my clothing line.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my food line.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my whatever line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Weed line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people are probably more apt to go
get it because they have a bigger reach
[SPEAKER_02]: than a normal everyday person.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it'll still probably go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes sense right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like as the industry is moving
forward I'm interested in the ways in
[SPEAKER_00]: which sort of you know we're going to
further roll out and become more
[SPEAKER_00]: mainstream to the point where eventually
you know I'm sure most NBA players will
[SPEAKER_00]: have you know signature strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's UFC fighters.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a guy in Arizona that has a whole
brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does he actually does it from soup to
nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that guy's badass dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to George Roop.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy does everything right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like and he's an old UFC fighter but he
doesn't he doesn't just buy people shit
[SPEAKER_02]: like he grows it you know hunts it etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's badass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a halo cannabis out in
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah there are people that do it from
soup to nuts and there are other people
[SPEAKER_02]: that just buy it from whoever's growing it
and they just put it in their bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's there's all kinds of
variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you were talking about the block
party genetics having the super sherb in
[SPEAKER_00]: it you you mentioned in houses you know
the creator of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was going to ask you anyway have you
had any contact from like in-house or only
[SPEAKER_00]: you know like have they reached out and
been like oh you know it's cool to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what you've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in-house I've talked to them multiple
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about some collabs and then
only I've talked to Nick from only and
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also talked to Harry Palms from now
bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah they're all they're all cool with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've sent them seeds or offered to
send them seeds and or genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all the same boat man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it's like offering wine to a
person that makes wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't want you know I don't want
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like but they're all cool with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you know it's the same with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like anybody that buys my seeds pop them
make your own strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you bought this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're your seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't own that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit like I sold it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yours now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the same kind of vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those guys have also given me that
same vibe like cool blessings like maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll do something in the future kind of
vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every single one of those dudes I reach
out to and talk to ask them for blessings
[SPEAKER_02]: and or told them like hey I do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're all cool with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah every single one of those guys has
been cool as fuck for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my interactions with those guys you
mentioned they've all been really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I wanted to ask as sort of a
follow up but maybe it should have been a
[SPEAKER_00]: preamble to it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when you made the blockberry were
you aware that when you were grabbing for
[SPEAKER_00]: example the Tropicana cookies is the one
that stands out to me more so that like
[SPEAKER_00]: this was a strain that was going to really
pave the way and become like this super
[SPEAKER_00]: fire strain or was it totally sort of just
coincidence that you happen to have these
[SPEAKER_00]: two strains that like you know went on to
be reasonably popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was absolutely the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I was doing it everybody was on
the tail end of Tropicana cookies because
[SPEAKER_02]: it was already at the F2s.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people had already done the F1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like I'm at the end of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had their own specific cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people at the Mountain Tropicana
or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people were already anti Tropicana
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then same with anything punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the funny thing is is is that everybody
hated everything punch related.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone hated fucking cookies or
chopped cookies related.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a mind fuck for me that anybody
wanted my shit because literally here in
[SPEAKER_02]: the States everybody was anti punch
crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything was purple punch purple punch
purple punch cross right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like fuck purple punch crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all bullshit doesn't do this doesn't
do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's like fuck chopped cookies fuck
cookies in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was I was blown away that anybody
like still like I'll tell people and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're like you could see him like you'd
see their brains like this cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the funny thing right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that just goes to show you that like
people and I do it myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: People will look at a cross like no not
doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't want those two crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But guess what.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be a fucking banger right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't know the phenotypes that
they're working with etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah it was it was it was mind blowing
that anybody even wanted any of the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest it wasn't for Jay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't for him popping the seeds and
selling the fucking shit out of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: These clones and growing it to perfection.
[SPEAKER_02]: People would have never wanted this shit
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based on the cross alone they would
have been like I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah it was it was a mind fuck that
anybody wanted to fuck with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah sure sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look you know you sort of touched on
to something which I've been hopping on
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time which is that like I think
the most interesting part about plants is
[SPEAKER_00]: not when you get like say you know let's
let's say that you were looking for you
[SPEAKER_00]: know GMO cross sherb not when you get just
purely GMO smell on the sherb body but
[SPEAKER_00]: when you get a little extra out of it you
know something a little unexpected because
[SPEAKER_00]: as you said sometimes people look at stuff
on paper and they're like oh not into it
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's the unexpected that comes out of
it that can often be the most interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes and I've done that a few times in the
sense of like I'm trying to also
[SPEAKER_02]: disseminate what's going to be good right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like people are like oh this one to
this one but like everybody's trying to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that when they see the cross right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like oh it's got to be a banger
because this is crossed with that and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're both bangers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but I tried to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not I'm not immune to this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like when I saw that tiger cake from
fucking compound I was like that shit
[SPEAKER_02]: looks dank to me dude like I think it was
like layer cake cross with menthol or
[SPEAKER_02]: something and it was like to me I don't
know for whatever reason nobody nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: took to that like I was like that shit
looks fucking dope and I grabbed it and
[SPEAKER_02]: popped it and it's amazing but everybody's
different than what they're looking for so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hard not to fall into that trap
because you're trying to figure out like
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're not going to see everybody
has let's say a line that they drop right
[SPEAKER_02]: and then there's let's say there's 10
breeders they all drop a line the line
[SPEAKER_02]: will have at least 10 so that's like 100
right so it's like 100 strange like fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: dude how do I figure out which ones to buy
so you have to look at it and be like oh
[SPEAKER_02]: that thing looks like yeah that'll be like
good with that but you don't get to see
[SPEAKER_02]: them all right you don't get to see what
they all look like and finish flower etc
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's the other key thing a lot of
readers just so you know like take a look
[SPEAKER_02]: at this you'll never most likely you won't
see finished flower hardly ever they won't
[SPEAKER_02]: show you that why is that I don't know but
like they'll show you what it looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: on a plant they'll show you this fucking
giant donk etc right so it's hard to wade
[SPEAKER_02]: through all the options to figure out what
you know because you got to spend your
[SPEAKER_02]: money on something but you got to figure
out which one you think is gonna be the
[SPEAKER_02]: best but it's not easy man so it's hard
it's hard to it's hard to differentiate
[SPEAKER_02]: between all the different dope readers
especially like the legacy guys you know
[SPEAKER_02]: what I mean like you fall through your own
little rabbit holes and it's just hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out like what's gonna be dope but
like a lot of the times you really don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know even if it's like banger to banger it
could be shit you should never know yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: completely completely I uh I don't know
where to slot this one in so we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: do it right here would you ever do
blockberry s1s I already did blockberry
[SPEAKER_02]: s1s yes I did them and they they here's
the problem did they go out to the public
[SPEAKER_00]: no okay I was about to say did I do such a
bad job researching that yeah so I have
[SPEAKER_02]: them so here's the problem of blockberry
for at least my cut every time I reverse
[SPEAKER_02]: it it'll throw like a shit ton of uh of uh
male male sacks and whatnot but they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: dump so and that's the problem so for me
like when we talk about let's go back for
[SPEAKER_02]: a second right when I did the the super
sherb you know created the uh the block
[SPEAKER_02]: party and when I did the Halle Berry cross
ice cream cake all those things and I said
[SPEAKER_02]: like I only got 10 seeds 20 seeds 30 seeds
it's because the blockberry my personal
[SPEAKER_02]: cut it'll reverse fine but it doesn't
throw a shit ton of pollen and that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: problem so I'll I mean for the s1s I
probably have like I don't know 30 to 50
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds so it's it's I'm not gonna sell them
like what am I gonna you know what am I
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna get out of that doesn't make sense
I'll just keep them but I do have them and
[SPEAKER_02]: uh I think the better option for the
blockberry is to um I don't know if I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know if the fans are ever going to
be great for at least my cut so that's why
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to do these f2s now it it
receives regular pollen really well and it
[SPEAKER_02]: shoots out thousands of seeds so um on
that note that blockberry cross of
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry frosting that'll be coming out
soon I'm gonna be doing these uh
[SPEAKER_02]: blockberry f2s probably at the same time
and some other stuff too so I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: probably be doing all kinds of stuff at
that point but most of them well pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: much all will be regular seeds because
like I said it doesn't it doesn't it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't uh reverse well yeah that's that's
really interesting to hear definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse or something we've discussed on
the show being very like um not just
[SPEAKER_00]: strain to strain but cutting to cutting
specific and so while we're on that topic
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to quickly ask do you have any
preference regular versus feminized
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding I personally like regulars um
because it's it's much more viable it
[SPEAKER_02]: lasts longer the pollen itself as well so
like for instance I had some pretty fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen um didn't make that many seeds of
some reversal and then I had some old-ass
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry frosting right I had a little
bit left and it created thousands of seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just much more viable right it lasts
longer you can store it longer um you get
[SPEAKER_02]: better to meet you know more healthy seeds
not as many herms um the the reversals are
[SPEAKER_02]: great for people that want to obviously
guarantee that they're going to be females
[SPEAKER_02]: but the the issue is also what I don't
think a lot of people take into
[SPEAKER_02]: consideration is this even though you may
get all females you're also going to get
[SPEAKER_02]: mutants and you're also going to get uh
herms so you're going to have to cool
[SPEAKER_02]: those as well so let's say you have a 10
pack boom we got this many mutants this
[SPEAKER_02]: many herms you're left with three or four
females so to me I'd rather have the the
[SPEAKER_02]: males I'd rather pack or excuse me I'd
rather pop a pack of 10 regs get the four
[SPEAKER_02]: females have the six males pick a uh dope
male pick a dope female maybe and then and
[SPEAKER_02]: then blast them off in the backyard or
something you know what I mean and then
[SPEAKER_02]: create my own thousands of seeds for
future reference just a bank of genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's me personally but I get it why
people want fens because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: guaranteed but like I said what they're
not taking into account is the herm rate
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the uh mutant rate yeah um I
want to I wanted to ask because you you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned it a little earlier and I keep
forgetting that some people may not have
[SPEAKER_00]: heard the the little shorter segment we
did on the breeder of the year awards so
[SPEAKER_00]: tell us a little bit about the blueberry
frosting which I'm sure other people have
[SPEAKER_02]: seen pop up in some of your work yeah so
the blueberry frosting was from a guy in
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa Cruz um party time farms basically
uh he created it and it's wedding crash
[SPEAKER_02]: across a blueberry cookies I believe and
he replied to one of my stories I was like
[SPEAKER_02]: asking about blueberry turps and I'm like
I was like dude I got this fucking cross
[SPEAKER_02]: that I made that's got blueberry turps
because I'm like like we were talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about earlier it's all connected right I
was like I just want to switch out the
[SPEAKER_02]: turps or something else so he basically
said he's like hey man and I have pollen I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like no shit so he sent me seeds weed
and pollen I was like fuck yeah bro so
[SPEAKER_02]: like I got to smoke the weed I got to see
all I got to pop some seeds and I got
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen so blueberry frosting came from him
party time farm shout out the only
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunate thing is that he's not going
to probably hear this he might hear it but
[SPEAKER_02]: he I think he moved I think he went to
like Columbia or some shit he like closed
[SPEAKER_02]: down so that's where I got the pollen from
and it was and um I haven't heard back
[SPEAKER_02]: from him for a long time but that's where
the pollen came from and then uh what was
[SPEAKER_00]: the other part of the question the what
sort of stuff can people expect from it in
[SPEAKER_02]: the crosses they see it pop up in oh yeah
so um so far what I've gotten from what
[SPEAKER_02]: I've what I've hunted and or popped uh
full candy gas it was fucking amazing so
[SPEAKER_02]: like this grape cream cake cross with uh
the great cream cake 2.1 cross of
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry frosting number 11 is a fucking
banger so I have that on my instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: right now it's so fucking sweet it's like
sweet candy blueberries with gas at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end it's it's insane like it's like uh gas
in the sense that like it hits you in the
[SPEAKER_02]: top of your sinuses if you know what I
mean it's like it's like uh Vic's vapor
[SPEAKER_02]: rub I don't you guys have that right
mental like hit you in the top of your
[SPEAKER_02]: sinuses like opens up your sinuses like
holy fuck but with like blueberries looks
[SPEAKER_02]: great smells great tastes great smokes
fucking great that's the one so at least
[SPEAKER_02]: for now for me um but that's that's like
one of the cross that and that's one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the ones that I have right now I also did
this one uh with that with that blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: frosting cross with tiger cake we just
talked about that randomly um and that
[SPEAKER_02]: shit is fucking ridiculous so the uh the
one that I have it's also so random it's
[SPEAKER_02]: also a number 11 it's fucking through this
giant like um for you to be like rugby
[SPEAKER_02]: ball right like a fucking giant huge cola
it's like a giant rugby ball I was like
[SPEAKER_02]: what the fuck and it was like it's insane
looking um same thing but this one has a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of funk to it because the tiger
cake has this nasty burnt tire uh
[SPEAKER_02]: halitosis vibe to it that's just like
super gassed heavy earth just nasty but it
[SPEAKER_02]: has candy on the front so that's another
one so I've got both of those I've got
[SPEAKER_02]: like the whole I've got a shit ton of them
but those are the two that are like my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite so um what to expect is from any
of those if you get a good one because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna get that fucking candy ass
gas with whatever else you mix it with so
[SPEAKER_02]: all the ones that I mix it with pretty
much have gas to them so you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_02]: either candy with some funk or just candy
with some gas you're just candy candy so
[SPEAKER_02]: uh it's really but like or candy menthol
so that's that's what I've gotten so far
[SPEAKER_02]: from all the ones and like these uh
blockberry cross with the blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: frosting I'm assuming they don't have some
blueberry I'll probably find some
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry leaners with like just a little
bit of earthy maybe a little bit of tangy
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know hopefully there's no tangy in
some of those but uh yeah we'll see what
[SPEAKER_02]: happens with those you'll you'll get a
just keep following me on the instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start posting some pics probably in
the next like two months I just literally
[SPEAKER_02]: popped seeds like maybe two weeks ago so
those are going right now oh that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really exciting and I love that you
mentioned that the mental I feel like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: um really nice flavor that you don't hear
about quite as much as you might expect
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to quickly draw us back you
said the word halitosis and you got me
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking have you ever been into the chems
like specifically the chem d often gets
[SPEAKER_02]: described as being very halitosis yeah and
that's why that's why I love that one so I
[SPEAKER_02]: had uh two tiger cake pinos the tiger cake
so I apologize because I eventually got
[SPEAKER_02]: them mixed up it was like a two and a one
or something like that I don't know it was
[SPEAKER_02]: like the first two they're not that big
they're kind of medium structure they kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of grow like a candelabra like kind of
wide weird and they don't grow that well
[SPEAKER_02]: in veg but then once you get that switch
to when they go to flower they fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: blast off and uh there was this one it was
just so fucking rank it was like the
[SPEAKER_02]: loudest um and so and and like uh I think
it's a voyage voyage bloom and I think in
[SPEAKER_02]: uh in Michigan has it right now they've
been doing a bunch of hype about it uh
[SPEAKER_02]: they have that one I think Frank's finest
in Arizona also has that one I didn't sell
[SPEAKER_02]: it to too many people but they have it and
it's fucking disgusting in the best way
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's like this it's like if you had a
gram of it and you walk into a house like
[SPEAKER_02]: the walls are gonna fucking read it's just
so fucking good and so gross but it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: heavy and it's just like pure indica vibes
bro just like heavy ass smoke put you on
[SPEAKER_02]: your ass it's just like you got to take a
nap you know what I'm saying it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gnarly like I love it to death it
doesn't it's not I wouldn't call it a
[SPEAKER_02]: production strain it's not gonna give you
three plus a light but what it does give
[SPEAKER_02]: you it's fucking insane it gives you these
like super fox tailey ugly ass like
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful ugly ass it looks like a
poisonous plant you know what I mean it's
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking beautiful like I've got some um
some pics on my page but yeah it's amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: man but yeah Tim 100% but with um with
that menthol still there it's like the
[SPEAKER_02]: high note to like relieve your sinuses
it's a trip dude but it's out there it's
[SPEAKER_02]: still out there I got rid of it um because
I had to keep moving on keep hunting new
[SPEAKER_02]: shit but it's it's still out there so I
can get it back at some point but yeah I
[SPEAKER_02]: still have some crosses with it I did a
blackberry cross to it I did a blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: frosting cross to it and I think that was
it but I have those seeds in my in my
[SPEAKER_00]: house for sure in the bank ah lovely
lovely you got me realizing I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually ask you are you more of an indica
or sativa guy uh indica if I can help it
[SPEAKER_02]: indica leaner right because they're all
hybrids at this point I'm more of an
[SPEAKER_02]: indica leaner guy um if it's more heavy
sativa like it just like I have to 100%
[SPEAKER_02]: drink to uh even it out because like I'll
get bugged out right like I get paranoid
[SPEAKER_02]: like I just can't it's not it's not my cup
of tea so like I like more indica leaners
[SPEAKER_02]: but like the blockberry and all that shit
it's to me it's like it's like a true
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid it's like a widget in the sense
that like it fits right in the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: perfectly um but I would like more indica
vibe out of it so like that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: trying like that's what I'm so excited
about this uh animal tsunami cross dude I
[SPEAKER_02]: think that's gonna be the fucking one dude
like I think that's gonna be like blast
[SPEAKER_02]: off like for all the indica heavy vibes
like boom like we'll see what happens but
[SPEAKER_02]: like unfortunately again but we were
talking about earlier the uh it doesn't it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't yield a great ton of uh viable
ponds so I only have however many seeds at
[SPEAKER_02]: the uh of the cross but I'm just gonna
hunt them and yeah right now I've got some
[SPEAKER_02]: in the hopper just to see proof of concept
see if it you know a the germ rates are
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% which is great um structure looks
great so far they're only a few weeks old
[SPEAKER_02]: but uh they look very vigorous and like I
obviously have to see her rates so if
[SPEAKER_02]: they're good I'll probably pop more but
yeah that's one that I'm super super
[SPEAKER_02]: excited about but um to answer your
question more more indica vibe than
[SPEAKER_02]: anything or hybrid I don't like super
heavy sativas that like make your heart
[SPEAKER_02]: race and shit so it's not for me bro I
already did my acid and fucking shroom
[SPEAKER_02]: trips a thousand times you know what I'm
saying like I don't need that unless I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to you know so I gotta I gotta give
credit you know you've mentioned the
[SPEAKER_00]: animal tsunami three times now you have to
tell us a little bit about it oh I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: honest I cheated I quickly googled it and
I can see it's animal cookies by caramel
[SPEAKER_02]: tsunami what's the plant like um I've only
grown it from the actual breeder and it is
[SPEAKER_02]: a great structured plant it's vigorous uh
medium to to large yields um coated in
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking trichomes it has a sweet almost
caramel um turp to it on the back end
[SPEAKER_02]: indica dominant I would say and um side
note just to add to all this is that if
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody wants to try it because I'll
produce it um uh the jungle boys have it
[SPEAKER_02]: in the repertoire and they'll post about
it from time to time so I know that they
[SPEAKER_02]: grow it and uh the guy that uh met with
the uh the original breeder he's also down
[SPEAKER_02]: here in southern California so he tries to
um he's he's better than me and if you
[SPEAKER_02]: know I'll tell you that so he he'll do
like a thousand seeds or you know he's
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for those unique super unique um
outliers so he spends his time so he finds
[SPEAKER_02]: he finds the gems out of all his crosses
for me I'm just trying to find the I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to make everything pretty good right I
don't want to have to hunt a thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds to find it and I don't know what
he's doing but like I just know that he
[SPEAKER_02]: picks that he picks the creme de la creme
so um and it's his cut so it's a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: banger yeah beautiful that's exciting
something we we ask all guests when they
[SPEAKER_02]: come on the show what style of growing do
you use so basically I use cocoa um yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: for for my personal stuff I'm a small
timer right so I don't have like
[SPEAKER_02]: everything set up as I should probably if
I was a if I was a production guy I'd have
[SPEAKER_02]: like rock wool and everything would be on
timers etc etc so for me personally what I
[SPEAKER_02]: do is I don't have the time to spend on
all of it because like I said I think I
[SPEAKER_02]: told you this in the maybe one of the
first ones or first podcast not sure if I
[SPEAKER_02]: told you this but um I'm doing this just
as like a kind of side hobby that I just
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy so I don't didn't really have any
plans to be like a breeder per se so for
[SPEAKER_02]: me I'm still like a home grower so um I
just do the the cocoa and pots and they
[SPEAKER_02]: change obviously throughout the throughout
the course of the uh of the grill I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: probably end it like two to three gallon
pots and I fucking hand water dude and so
[SPEAKER_02]: like I'm antiquated bro like I'm a rookie
right I know how to do all the other shit
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously um throughout the course of my
my growing tenure but like for me I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have so much time to spend on it so uh
cocoa hand water salts um but I will do um
[SPEAKER_02]: organic uh little attributes you know what
I mean like I'll do I'll do some I'll do
[SPEAKER_02]: some uh I'll do some feeds with some some
organics up here and there but mostly it's
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly just salts yeah nice cool I can
certainly relate I love that you're uh
[SPEAKER_00]: still hand watering as someone who does
that I uh I love the time you get to spend
[SPEAKER_02]: with the plants I will say this it's
literally it is it's it's a break from you
[SPEAKER_02]: know the kids family I'm like I gotta get
like so it literally is time to just get
[SPEAKER_02]: away it's like my man cave right it's like
my little hobby so I'm like that's part of
[SPEAKER_02]: it if I had everything on automation my
wife would be like why I'm like uh we're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna check through but that's part of it
so you're so you touch on something but
[SPEAKER_02]: the other thing is is that uh um if I was
a production guy you know more than
[SPEAKER_02]: anything I would definitely have like
automated everything um but like I said
[SPEAKER_02]: man I'm small dude I'm not I'm never
trying to blast my head up I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: stay as humble as I can I'm nobody big I'm
just dude just trying to make seeds that
[SPEAKER_02]: people can make good shit out of so like I
don't have a bunch of fancy equipment or
[SPEAKER_02]: or or you know locations but I do partner
with some people so can't lie I can't say
[SPEAKER_02]: like I don't have like those facilities
available available to me but for me
[SPEAKER_02]: personally yeah just dude I'm just a hand
waterer chilling at the crib you know what
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like I don't have anything fancy
man and in terms of uh just just so you
[SPEAKER_02]: just so you know so people ask me all the
time what newts do you use I'm like newts
[SPEAKER_02]: are like the last thing that I care about
the things that I care about the most are
[SPEAKER_02]: environment and genetics so if you have
the environment and the genetics dialed in
[SPEAKER_02]: the newts are just an additive to that
right so I'm like I don't want to put too
[SPEAKER_02]: much on newts because newts aren't going
to change or grow if you fucking have a
[SPEAKER_02]: shitty environment and or shitty genetics
right does that make sense a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: put too much on newts I'm like oh what
newts you using I'm like who gives a fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: like you know you can use whatever newts
but if you have shitty ass genetics and or
[SPEAKER_02]: shitty environment and shitty environment
controls you're never gonna be you're
[SPEAKER_02]: never gonna let that plant shine you know
what I'm saying so I'm not trying to diss
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody or plug anybody I'm just saying
that the most important factors are
[SPEAKER_02]: environment and genetics and then after
that I think all newts have their their
[SPEAKER_02]: pros and their cons I've used Athena great
shit works fucking perfect right I love it
[SPEAKER_02]: some people talk about cardboard turps
I've never had that right the shit tastes
[SPEAKER_02]: good smells good Athena's great crop salt
banging same shit they all have their
[SPEAKER_02]: goods and their bads front row ag at least
in the states I don't know if you guys
[SPEAKER_02]: have that out there all good do they all
have the same shit you just have to kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of work each one I did Fox Farms when I
first started you know what I mean like
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all different so everything you
just have to work with so I would say the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients portion is just like an additive
but like if you don't know what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing overall it's not gonna help no
matter what you know what nutrient line
[SPEAKER_00]: you use sorry went off on a tangent no
it's you're totally correct you know like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no point having the best newts in
the game if your environments trash so I
[SPEAKER_00]: like that answer for sure I wanted to
quickly ask you are there any older lines
[SPEAKER_00]: that you would be interested in playing
with you know like something maybe you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get your hands on a daydreamed
about yeah I actually did just get some of
[SPEAKER_02]: some of them it's uh it's this old gg4
cross so gorilla glue four cross it's uh
[SPEAKER_02]: let me look it up real quick I have it on
my I just got this like seed pack from
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody it was terpy seed so it's called
unbroken chain right it's gd4 cross of
[SPEAKER_02]: three gorillas by Michael tech so shout
out to both of those people and then shout
[SPEAKER_02]: out to terpy seeds for hooking me up so
that's like an older line because like I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know what happened with gd4 or
gorilla glue whatever happened I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know if you guys ever got out there but
it's so fucking gassy thank bro it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's super did you guys have that out
there it never made its way out here but I
[SPEAKER_00]: have been lucky enough to have tried it a
few times while in the states yeah it
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking it did its thing right so like
that's one that I like I'm trying to go
[SPEAKER_02]: back on um but that's like one of the only
ones that I'm like dude that's like the
[SPEAKER_02]: one so that's like just for me just off
the top of my head but there's like a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of shit dude like I had uh
somebody's grew up blue dream recently um
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot I'm like fuck dude this thing is
a giant fucking beast of a plant it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's amazing but it's like super leafy you
know what I mean it's like eh I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: want that but there's some old hazes that
are fucking big old bangers you know nls
[SPEAKER_02]: etc dude I don't know but like the one
that sticks out to me is that is that
[SPEAKER_02]: unbroken chain that's the one for me right
now at least and then like we were talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about earlier the uh the uh the g are
excuse me the uh the skywalker og I've got
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of those online that I'm like
still trying to find out who like has them
[SPEAKER_02]: like I've got a couple ogs and I still
want to fuck with um but yeah for the old
[SPEAKER_02]: school it's obviously everybody is always
talking about og but probably get that og
[SPEAKER_02]: and that gd4 cross and like I think those
would be the ones for me for sure
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful stuff I gotta admit I feel like
gg4 is having a bit of a resurgence I've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard a few people sort of make comments
along the lines of yours being like you
[SPEAKER_02]: know it's it's killer really yeah I'm
surprised because like it fell off and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like dude this shit is fucking fire dude
like you know what I mean but people are
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing back old school shit like I said
people just brought back blue dream of all
[SPEAKER_02]: things I'm like holy shit right but like
people I think are just bringing back
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies crosses old school cookies shit
form cuts etc etc um obviously the uh the
[SPEAKER_02]: uh ogs big time so yeah there's a bunch of
shit um the problem with the older ones is
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're not production strains and
that's kind of how we got led to where we
[SPEAKER_02]: got led to like the big guys are doing
like they need a certain amount of volume
[SPEAKER_02]: otherwise it doesn't pay their bills you
know what I mean like they have to do
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking thousands of plants and rooms etc
to pay their bills so they're not willing
[SPEAKER_02]: to really risk pulling an old school you
know heady ass stash cut you know what I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean like it just doesn't make sense for
them so um my goal if I ever if I ever
[SPEAKER_02]: cross these is going to be to be like just
like like what I said is like I want to I
[SPEAKER_02]: want to get those chirps and that flavor
into a different body so that that would
[SPEAKER_02]: be my that would be my goal and it's it's
on it's on the to-do list dude I tried it
[SPEAKER_02]: with the fucking tk and apparently that
works like the uh it's called super cush I
[SPEAKER_02]: took the super booth name even though I
didn't use a super booth cut that one does
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly that as it it's it'll be either a
kush leaner or a fucking uh blockberry
[SPEAKER_02]: leaner uh but yeah that shit yields and
it's heavy and it's big so yeah and where
[SPEAKER_00]: in general do you think the commercial
producing scene is heading you know do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think that the big commercial producers
are gonna slowly narrow their window their
[SPEAKER_00]: menu sorry of strains they offer and
eventually it's just gonna be like a small
[SPEAKER_00]: number of things that are really big
yielding super well smoking or what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think is gonna happen in the long term do
you think will retain diversity exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: what you said in the first part the big
producers are I would say most of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna have to pay their bills and what the
prices of everything going down they're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna only keep like the big yielding I
don't know if they're cardboard terms for
[SPEAKER_02]: like the low I don't know man I think that
it's gonna be like just the big yields bag
[SPEAKER_02]: appeal stuff it's not gonna matter as much
for quality in the sense of like um turps
[SPEAKER_02]: and flavor I think they're gonna care more
about like bag appeal tt percentage and
[SPEAKER_02]: yield right so like those are the boxes
that I think they're gonna check um I
[SPEAKER_02]: think though like let's let's let's let so
like I said I'm a big beer guy let's bring
[SPEAKER_02]: it back to that there's the anhyzer bush
there's the course there's the nickel ove
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever right the paps so there's old
generational giant conglomerates of beer
[SPEAKER_02]: and then now they have these small
microbreweries that are popping up so I
[SPEAKER_02]: think what's gonna end up happening is
there's gonna be the big-time guys that do
[SPEAKER_02]: all these fucking traditional strains that
you know that's gonna be their cardboard
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking you know loggers right no
disrespect to loggers but then they're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be these little guys that are gonna
be like local local guys that are like
[SPEAKER_02]: really into whatever flavors and then
they're gonna produce that that's not like
[SPEAKER_02]: a high yielder but it's fucking you know
tastes great looks great doesn't yield
[SPEAKER_02]: that great but like they don't have such a
high overhead so they can focus on flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: right so I think that's what's gonna
happen it's gonna open the way to a
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller craft rower it's what I'm hoping
and that's what I'm banking on actually
[SPEAKER_00]: well you just read my mind because I was
gonna say you know with that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: forecast there how do you think that
relates to sort of the home grower on
[SPEAKER_02]: average do you think there is a future for
them um at this price point right now it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't really make much sense it's more
of just like to do a hobby as you or may
[SPEAKER_02]: not know if you grow it's a shit ton of
work you never get any days off it's hard
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's just never-ending right so like
some days are easy some days are hard some
[SPEAKER_02]: days are long some days are short but like
the point is is that it doesn't end it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not like if you're sick you still have to
attend to the garden the plants will die
[SPEAKER_02]: like if you don't feed them right or if
you don't water them so um yes there will
[SPEAKER_02]: still always be that uh hobby grower uh
there will be new people that coming into
[SPEAKER_02]: the scene that kind of you know replace
the other ones it just depends on what
[SPEAKER_02]: your what your goal is so if you're if
you're gonna be you know just growing for
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself because it's fun for you like
yeah there's always gonna be that but like
[SPEAKER_02]: uh to answer your question as well like I
just I just want to the grocer the other
[SPEAKER_02]: day and it was fucking closed it's like
what the fuck man it's it's gone like this
[SPEAKER_02]: is crazy so like and like the only reason
why I used to go to that one is because my
[SPEAKER_02]: other one closed I'm like dude so those
are closing left and right so I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna get smaller and smaller harder and
harder um and like the best will survive
[SPEAKER_02]: right so it'll be a weeding out process
and then like I said at some point people
[SPEAKER_02]: are gonna be like dude these fucking rock
hard little fucking you know asteroid
[SPEAKER_02]: looking nuggets that don't even look like
weed that are dry as fuck they turn into
[SPEAKER_02]: powder ain't my jam but I can do better
than this and they're gonna be like fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: this and they're gonna start from scratch
and learn the whole shit or already have
[SPEAKER_02]: some type of some type of uh industry
industry knowledge and they're like fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: this I'm gonna do a lot of shit and then
they're gonna create their own little
[SPEAKER_02]: craft thing you know what I mean so like I
think craft will always be there because
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody wants the Budweiser weed you know
what I'm saying like it's cool well like
[SPEAKER_02]: the the mass in my opinion the people that
are fucking weed heads they're already
[SPEAKER_02]: hardcore in the game they're deep in the
game right they're not fucking newbies you
[SPEAKER_02]: know moms the moms are gonna be eating
edibles they're gonna be eating gummies
[SPEAKER_02]: like they don't give a fuck they don't say
daytime like okay that's what I want oh
[SPEAKER_02]: nighttime that's what I want like they
don't give a shit the fucking real weed
[SPEAKER_02]: heads are gonna be into fucking flavor
potency etc whatever they think that they
[SPEAKER_02]: want right and then they're gonna be like
this that and the third so I think there's
[SPEAKER_02]: always gonna be a market for the I would
say craft aspect of it but in terms of the
[SPEAKER_02]: home grower I mean I don't know man it's
expensive as hell if they come down if the
[SPEAKER_02]: home grower looks at their electric bill
looks at the amount of you know the cost
[SPEAKER_02]: for the seas all the equipment etc etc etc
the return on investment that's gonna take
[SPEAKER_02]: them years as opposed to like the prices
they get at a dispensary or from their
[SPEAKER_02]: local dude so I don't know man I think
they the local home grower guy will have
[SPEAKER_02]: to be the hardcore heady person the guy or
girl like they got to really want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: really make it make sense yeah certainly
it certainly feels that way doesn't it let
[SPEAKER_00]: me let me take us back to the question we
used to start the show with tell me about
[SPEAKER_00]: your first ever experience with cannabis
oh man this is funny so I was in high
[SPEAKER_02]: school and I was like maybe 14 or 15 I was
a freshman and and I grew up in the Bay
[SPEAKER_02]: Area so it's like San Francisco Bay Area
and so drugs are really prevalent up there
[SPEAKER_02]: you have hate streaming all that shit it's
like it's just drugs are not like out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the ordinary if you will so they're
everywhere like you can just go to hate
[SPEAKER_02]: street and get whatever the fuck you want
from some homeless guy but uh yeah so I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like a little kid really because I'm
like 14 15 something like that I was like
[SPEAKER_02]: anti drugs I was like no I'm not doing
drugs and then I was like one homie after
[SPEAKER_02]: the other fell off they're all fucking
doing drugs I was like fuck I was the last
[SPEAKER_02]: guy and I was like Peter lost all my
friends basically so like I gotta I gotta
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta in order to hang out with Mike so
that I gotta be able to smoke or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: so I was with this dude Demetri and this
other dude Jerry or some shit so we're by
[SPEAKER_02]: these tennis courts it was in high school
at like lunch break or something some dude
[SPEAKER_02]: had you know quote-unquote Maui Waui so he
packs a bowl fuck him there smoke a bowl
[SPEAKER_02]: with them it's coming on my nose homeboy
is like hey dude it's coming out of your
[SPEAKER_02]: nose he's plugging my nose while I'm
sucking on it and uh nothing happened I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like that was cool whatever so I
didn't get high at all um and that was my
[SPEAKER_02]: first experience with them after that but
then I was like open to it it was like
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of fun just hanging out these guys
were laughing their asses off and like I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like hanging out just unstoned didn't
get me fucked up because it probably just
[SPEAKER_02]: came out of my nose right so um the second
time I got stoned I got fucking ripped and
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like giggling uncontrollably
couldn't stop laughing like the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: world was on on its head I was like holy
fuck I was like fucked up I remember like
[SPEAKER_02]: I slept for forever that night it was
insane and then after that I was hooked so
[SPEAKER_02]: the first time it was like on some fake I
don't know if it was real or not Maui Waui
[SPEAKER_02]: this is so mind you guess I'm gonna age
myself here 92 93 so it was a long time
[SPEAKER_02]: ago and like this is before anybody even
had strained names but uh yeah Demetri did
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah so so that was the first time dude
Demetri I think is it Jerry or some shit
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah yeah that was the first time I smoked
man and then after that it was like it
[SPEAKER_02]: went from um you know like once in a while
to you know once a week twice a week three
[SPEAKER_02]: times a week then it became uh fucking it
it escalated quickly bro it was not good
[SPEAKER_02]: like literally like seven days a week then
every day I wake up and I go smoking a day
[SPEAKER_02]: four o'clock rolls around smoking mom ribs
so it got pretty fucking bad pretty quick
[SPEAKER_02]: dude but uh yeah man the first time was
like that that Maui Waui and uh by the uh
[SPEAKER_00]: by the tennis courts man yeah that was the
first time beautiful I love that so how
[SPEAKER_02]: did that progress to your first grow so as
a kid um all I like you had to pay for it
[SPEAKER_02]: you had to you had to find a hookup it was
like at that age it's not easy unless you
[SPEAKER_02]: have like an uncle or cousin or somebody
that's like linked right so it's like how
[SPEAKER_02]: the fuck do I find weed people were
selling fake shit like they're just you
[SPEAKER_02]: know uh we would uh live in next to San
Francisco we would drive up to San
[SPEAKER_02]: Francisco like it wasn't it never happened
to me luckily but like people get fake
[SPEAKER_02]: sacks filled with like fucking uh shredded
paper like you're getting jacked left and
[SPEAKER_02]: right right so you like you had to have
somebody who who was like somewhat in the
[SPEAKER_02]: know so um and and back in these days dude
it was like if you were lucky you would
[SPEAKER_02]: get $50 an eighth it was $60 an eighth and
it was like no breaks it was insane and it
[SPEAKER_02]: was eyeballed like you didn't like we
didn't have scales or okay like then we'd
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking I would try to like I was always a
business minded guy so like I'd crack it
[SPEAKER_02]: up into sacks and like try and get like
most of my money back to smoke for free
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's kind of how I started my
selling quote-unquote career right and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's how I kind of started the game but
uh to grow like I was like fuck dude and
[SPEAKER_02]: like it was seasonal it was only outdoor
at least where I was at and I was a few
[SPEAKER_02]: hours away from humble so like we would
get these seeds and I'll plant them and
[SPEAKER_02]: man the unfortunate thing is is like when
you're at that stage of life as a kid like
[SPEAKER_02]: you're too stupid man you talk about it
you let somebody know about it and the
[SPEAKER_02]: next thing you know they're fucking stolen
and like I had literally I've never I
[SPEAKER_02]: literally never got to harvest and you
grow I would grow like every fucking year
[SPEAKER_02]: and every year it gets stolen and and and
and vice versa like I was stupid I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like a little prick saw it steal people's
plants too when I found out it was like it
[SPEAKER_02]: was like that's just what happened and uh
but even then even if I saw them I never
[SPEAKER_02]: got to harvest them karma right so um I
would do it every fucking year and it'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: like my parents found out or oh here's it
here's a good one like I even tried to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it indoors one year and I had a thousand
watt HP at a thousand watt HPS in my
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking closet in my bedroom and like
every time every time the fucking like a
[SPEAKER_02]: thousand degrees in there dude so I had to
be constantly spraying it with water and
[SPEAKER_02]: fans and shit there was no uh you know uh
temperature controls and uh it was like
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe two feet from the plant I was like
holy fuck he was constantly almost melting
[SPEAKER_02]: and dying and like every time something
would turn the microwave on the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: house would go out like what the fuck I'm
like I don't know and I would always have
[SPEAKER_02]: glad to fucking put the breakers and shit
was hilarious and somehow that even
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking got swiped from me I don't even
know what happened with that I think I put
[SPEAKER_02]: it outside at some point my parents threw
it away but um that's what was the initial
[SPEAKER_02]: right and I used to stack all these so
back in the days what we got for
[SPEAKER_02]: information I'm going back a little bit
before um we didn't have uh there was no
[SPEAKER_02]: internet like literally the internet
didn't exist so like we had high times
[SPEAKER_02]: magazines like every week or every month
whatever it was so I had stacks of high
[SPEAKER_02]: times magazines on my desk I would
literally collect them every week or or I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it was every month uh and I would
just read those from cover to cover and I
[SPEAKER_02]: was just trying to learn about everything
and as a kid it's funny that we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about this because as a kid 15,
16, 17 years old I was like I just want to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow weed that was my fucking life goal
dude which is funny um that's all I wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to do and so uh so I would collect these
high times magazines that's where you gain
[SPEAKER_02]: all your knowledge from and I remember
high times cups from the beginning they
[SPEAKER_02]: had like AK-47 bubble gum I was like oh
I'm just gonna need mouthwatering like I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't wait to get to that point um but
yeah man uh I would start there and then
[SPEAKER_02]: there was like like I said it would always
get stolen there was never any like real
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't like a trap thing I was I was a
young kid so I didn't couldn't really trap
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere and uh and at some point I gave
up the whole thing because it was uh it
[SPEAKER_02]: was uh it was pretty heavy man like I got
robbed at gunpoint for an ounce of weed
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like getting him get the ounce it just
fucked me up in my head I was like this is
[SPEAKER_02]: not worth it dude it was like 300 bucks
somebody's trying to take my life so I
[SPEAKER_02]: basically fucking I was like fuck this I'm
done with this shit um and changed my
[SPEAKER_02]: whole trajectory in life right and then I
came back to it when uh like 2018-2019 I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like older established and I was like
no dude I'm just gonna see it and like
[SPEAKER_02]: literally like we were talking about
earlier so it comes back full circle right
[SPEAKER_02]: I basically took a couple seed packs that
I thought were way too expensive and threw
[SPEAKER_02]: them in my backyard some of which my dog
ate right and then it started from there
[SPEAKER_02]: and then from there I was like they got
eaten by bugs hated it outdoors was shit
[SPEAKER_02]: for me I was like this fucking sucks got
every problem in the world and then it was
[SPEAKER_02]: like I'm gonna do a light and then I did a
fucking dehumidifier then I did a AC unit
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what I mean I started building
building building and then and then that
[SPEAKER_02]: led us to today so yeah in a short
condensed obviously fashion art wow love
[SPEAKER_00]: it that's cool it's all full circle isn't
it I mean sort of not not quite as similar
[SPEAKER_00]: but like interestingly I wanted to ask you
about how like there'd been some reports
[SPEAKER_00]: that came out I think it might have been
yesterday maybe today um about how like
[SPEAKER_00]: MasterCard was like not going to accept
payments from cannabis stuff what's your
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts in regards to that and like how
America is projecting on the way to like
[SPEAKER_00]: federal legalization you know do you think
this represents like stagnation in a sense
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just a bunch of bullshit
because like it doesn't make any sense um
[SPEAKER_02]: most dispensaries have ATMs in them it's a
fucking joke dude it to me it's just like
[SPEAKER_02]: a uh it's a false flag it's like it's a
bunch of bullshit so you just you you
[SPEAKER_02]: declined it from from vendor to to the uh
to the uh patient or or or a customer
[SPEAKER_02]: right but guess what that customer can now
go to the fucking ATM that's already in
[SPEAKER_02]: their dispensary and get charged three or
four bucks like what's the difference like
[SPEAKER_02]: they're I don't know dude I think I think
it's a bunch of bullshit but stagnation in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of the federal like unfortunately um
has become a political issue and uh
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on what side of the aisle you're
on it's not I don't dislike or like you
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore or any less but like it seems like
the Republicans are always voting against
[SPEAKER_02]: it for federal legal legalization and I'm
like it's just like it's just like old and
[SPEAKER_02]: stagnant like like what you said yes it is
stagnating it and uh it's like old
[SPEAKER_02]: bullshit they're like makes you whatever
and this and that I'm like dude it's all
[SPEAKER_02]: bullshit it's all debunked bullshit so um
I don't know man federal legalization does
[SPEAKER_02]: need to happen though because like all
these people are rolling around with
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking all these people being like
legalized dispensaries they're rolling
[SPEAKER_02]: around hundreds of thousands of dollars in
cash they can't even they can't even
[SPEAKER_02]: deposit it like they have to go and pay
taxes with cash that's fucking insane dude
[SPEAKER_02]: there should be like regardless of whether
or not it's legal federally there should
[SPEAKER_02]: still be some safety guards in place to
where people aren't risking their lives
[SPEAKER_02]: getting robbed you know what I'm saying
just to just to deposit your taxes that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're charging them doesn't make any
sense it's it's a bunch of bullshit so um
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's going who the fuck knows right
I'm assuming it's going to depend on who
[SPEAKER_02]: is uh controlling the house and the senate
and as well as the presidency and who
[SPEAKER_02]: knows what the fuck they're going to do
and if they're actually going to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: right because everybody on that level
seems a lot like crazy no matter what side
[SPEAKER_02]: of the aisle they're on right they just
say what you want they just say what you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to hear until they get the office and
they do or don't do it but um yeah I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know man I think I think we're at a
stalemate I I hope that it gets legalized
[SPEAKER_02]: and like there's more and more states
coming online so at some point like what's
[SPEAKER_02]: the hold up right I don't know how many
states are online you probably have more
[SPEAKER_02]: research done than I have but like I'm
assuming there's probably like 20-ish
[SPEAKER_02]: states that are already online in a
medical or uh recreational uh capacity I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like what what the fuck is the hold up
dude like let's go you know what I mean so
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that's it that's it uh one of
the final questions we've got on breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: before we get to our quickfire ones was do
you consider the concentrate potential of
[SPEAKER_00]: strains when you make them or is it more
of like a secondary thing and if something
[SPEAKER_02]: happens to be good for that you're like oh
that's cool yeah secondary for me um I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't breed for hash so some people do
right and so I honestly I don't even smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: dabs or do hash like I don't I don't
really smoke hash like I'll fucking I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it if somebody's got it in like uh
in a joint or something but like I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: do dabs like I'm just I'm older now man
like I've already gotten as high as I need
[SPEAKER_02]: to get it's like I just like to like what
we're talking about earlier like I would
[SPEAKER_02]: like to smoke more uh and not get as high
and like in control my height easier than
[SPEAKER_02]: getting just fucking blasted off but back
in the days when I was younger I used to
[SPEAKER_02]: get as high as I fucking could to the
point where joints wouldn't even get me a
[SPEAKER_02]: head buzz so I've kind of like come full
circle in the sense that like I kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: see what works best for my body plus like
I was having health effects health
[SPEAKER_02]: problems like smoking that much it wasn't
good so um yeah so personally I don't uh
[SPEAKER_02]: create strains for hash um but that's just
me um so yeah I don't I don't do that
[SPEAKER_02]: personally if it comes out great then
that's great but yeah but the good news is
[SPEAKER_02]: um I've heard that the super booth cut as
well as the uh just blockberry in general
[SPEAKER_02]: wash pretty well I think they're like four
ish five ish percent from what I've heard
[SPEAKER_02]: so I guess that's great returns so that
was just luck though I didn't mean to have
[SPEAKER_00]: that happen uh yeah happy accident cool I
get it I get it yep I uh I also I think
[SPEAKER_00]: you kind of touched on it a bit earlier
but I wanted to ask you just specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have any tips or tricks for picking
males do you like to sort of pair it up
[SPEAKER_00]: with like what a female you like looks
like or is it a bit more of like a feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're like this one just looks the
best overall so yeah it's it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: vigor it's gonna be structure and then
when it flowers like I want to see what it
[SPEAKER_02]: does right so like um similar to females
like you could have tight noted stacks
[SPEAKER_02]: giant colas it could have fucking spread
out sparse little satellite buds if you
[SPEAKER_02]: will of male flowers so um the only thing
that I can't really gauge on a male as
[SPEAKER_02]: much like you could smell the fucking
plant right like it'll it'll have some
[SPEAKER_02]: turps to it but it's not the same as like
a female like you can't smell a dried
[SPEAKER_02]: flower off a male so that's the only kind
of x factor but like you could still smell
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant if you move it around
specifically oh shit this thing is fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: loud so um uh but what I look for as in in
terms of choosing male is bigger structure
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's pretty much the gist of it dude
because like structure in the sense of
[SPEAKER_02]: branching um spacing as well as the
structure of the male flower so the flower
[SPEAKER_02]: structure so those things are all kind of
considered in my personal aspect of
[SPEAKER_02]: structure and then the vigor so I want it
to be personally like I like quick um
[SPEAKER_02]: plants I don't like slow vegging like I
don't want these tiny little fuckers like
[SPEAKER_02]: and I know that those things work well in
a double stack system triple stack even
[SPEAKER_02]: some cases people have that but like I
like my shit to blast off you know what I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean like I'm gonna have a short ass veg
time and I wanted to fucking blast off in
[SPEAKER_02]: that atmosphere so I look for that I look
for quick quick veg big big frame like
[SPEAKER_02]: like strong I don't like um oh again
structure I don't like um thin uh branches
[SPEAKER_02]: at all like I hate when there's like um
colas that need to be or or buds that need
[SPEAKER_02]: to be like held up with a lot of a lot of
health like I I'd love for a plant to hold
[SPEAKER_02]: up its own self if that makes any sense
like I want it to be a strong female or
[SPEAKER_02]: strong male it's where it holds itself up
like I don't want these little thin ass
[SPEAKER_02]: branches like oh I clipped that branch and
snapped in half like I don't want that so
[SPEAKER_02]: again it goes down to structure so that's
what I look for in males nice I dig it I
[SPEAKER_00]: dig it I uh I also wanted to quickly ask
you before we do our final five I see you
[SPEAKER_00]: did some crosses with a plant called lemon
rose is that right tell us a bit about
[SPEAKER_02]: that oh yeah yes from dying green seeds
those are the guys that uh created uh
[SPEAKER_02]: skittles from my understanding um and that
dude check this out so this was actually
[SPEAKER_02]: from my buddy blood and fire dude so he
was like dude you gotta check this out he
[SPEAKER_02]: was like he's like I found this I found
this winner uh it has like all og leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: there's only three leaves this and that
and then so I looked up the turps I looked
[SPEAKER_02]: up everything about it and I was like fuck
dude that shit is sick so um yeah I used
[SPEAKER_02]: that um but yeah a buddy of mine gave me
that pollen as well that he actually
[SPEAKER_02]: hunted so I didn't actually hunt the male
and that was more of a uh I didn't know if
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to give that out to people but
like I talked to a couple people that had
[SPEAKER_02]: popped those seeds and they're like dude
it's a fucking banger so like that's why
[SPEAKER_02]: that's why I sent it out to the lexicon
but yeah that's where that came from but
[SPEAKER_02]: it was from dying breeds dying breed seeds
yeah nice sounds like it would have been
[SPEAKER_00]: super terpy cool cool so on to our final
five questions so first one what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: single most memorable experience you have
with cannabis so just whatever is left the
[SPEAKER_00]: most lasting impression pack doesn't have
to be like the most high you ever got or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything but the most memorable I guess
it'd probably be right now man like this
[SPEAKER_02]: is the most memorable now I'm on a fucking
podcast in Australia like this is the most
[SPEAKER_02]: memorable for weed like in all honesty
besides the fact when I was a little kid
[SPEAKER_02]: laughing my ass off choking on sandwiches
you know like out of my tree just learning
[SPEAKER_02]: about weed um yeah man I think right now
the most memorable so uh I've never
[SPEAKER_02]: thought like I said when I started this
whole thing wasn't to start anything it
[SPEAKER_02]: was just to just to make seed for myself
to have a genetic backup so that I can
[SPEAKER_02]: continue on because like I said I was a
seed junkie to an extent in the sense that
[SPEAKER_02]: like I was hunting all these seeds and
always get all these new seed packs and I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like fuck it's gonna take me like 10
years or 20 years to get through all these
[SPEAKER_02]: so I was like all right pop a couple from
this pack pop a couple from that pack get
[SPEAKER_02]: through it and then I would be like all
right but I didn't want to get rid of them
[SPEAKER_02]: for forever so I like I'll try to make
seed as a backup for genetics right so I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like all right okay I can get these later
so I never thought that this was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be anything so um right now man the fact
that I'm on the I'm on the horn with you
[SPEAKER_02]: dude in Australia is amazing like this is
probably the most memorable by far not
[SPEAKER_02]: just you but just in general right like
that I even looked at you know and or
[SPEAKER_02]: cared about so it's it's huge to me very
humbling bro I really appreciate it dude
[SPEAKER_00]: you're too kind glad to have you here so
next question what's a strain where like
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone maybe your friends but just in
general strain was getting really hyped
[SPEAKER_00]: you finally got to try it and you were
like a bit disappointed oh there's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a lot of those um for growing or
for smoking or like do you want to I just
[SPEAKER_02]: want to sleep with Oreos dude sorry like
that shit is fucking fire right but it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't taste great beautiful get you high
though you know I'm saying but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: it just it just looks so fucking good
doesn't really have any turps that's
[SPEAKER_02]: probably one of the biggest ones that like
as big as it got like I fucking love I
[SPEAKER_02]: love it the way it looks like I said it's
there's all kinds of good things about it
[SPEAKER_02]: but like that's the only thing bro it just
doesn't it just doesn't it just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: let down and like the terms of the taste
everything sorry bro like I know it's max
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry bro I'm not trying to but that was
like one of the ones that sticks out so
[SPEAKER_00]: the next question we do is I'm gonna drop
you off on a desert island you get to take
[SPEAKER_00]: three strains with you you get to have
them for the rest of your life what three
[SPEAKER_02]: strains oh shit these are hard questions
man uh here's the problem with me I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have favorites like people ask me what's
your favorite I'm like I don't have a
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite it constantly changes so this is
a very hard one um let's just go with uh
[SPEAKER_02]: uh I love that Skywalker OG man like I
always go back to that like whoever bred
[SPEAKER_02]: that more power to you dude fucking
amazing that shit is fucking fire on a uh
[SPEAKER_02]: on a personal tip I'll say like for my own
shit dude it'll be blockberry because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just it's just a widget in the
sense that like you could fucking fit that
[SPEAKER_02]: into any situation you're not going to be
too indicate out sativaed out you can
[SPEAKER_02]: still be social it's great and then uh on
a super fucking sativa shit bro maybe I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: do uh maybe do a larry bird bro fucking I
think it's what's gelato maybe I'll do
[SPEAKER_02]: that so yeah fucking OG blockberry and
gelato not a bad mix not a bad mix at all
[SPEAKER_00]: next one I got for years have you ever
smoked blockhead by breeder steve uh no is
[SPEAKER_02]: that the old school blockhead like the
block at og no and it's maybe I have but
[SPEAKER_02]: like I don't fucking know right so um not
that I know of we need to make it happen I
[SPEAKER_02]: know like it's gone like I don't know like
people ask me all the time like it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: the reach I'm like now it's different guy
like sorry but like I don't have it I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have all the shit that he has I
don't know yeah no have you ever had that
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually haven't had it either you're
right it's very hard to come by there are
[SPEAKER_00]: like some people who have done some back
crosses and stuff so maybe maybe I can try
[SPEAKER_02]: to reach out you know you know who'll have
it if anybody here in San Diego bro uh
[SPEAKER_02]: shout out to Sean Cron dude this fucking
guy has like everything dude like he has
[SPEAKER_02]: literally all the dope shit from forever
I'll hit that guy up but the hard part is
[SPEAKER_02]: he doesn't give a shit up so I'll never
get anyways but I could probably buy some
[SPEAKER_02]: flower off him if he has it I'll let you
know I'll let you know that works out but
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah I would love to get some old school
blockhead bro for sure but no I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked it that I'm aware of that's cool
that's cool I've seen now his Instagram it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks gnarly um all right so on to the
last question I've got a time machine you
[SPEAKER_00]: can go back in time anywhere any place
presumably to collect either some seeds or
[SPEAKER_00]: a clone of something where you gonna go
what are you gonna get hmm shit these are
[SPEAKER_02]: mind-boggling here um honestly don't know
which one I would get but I know what time
[SPEAKER_02]: frame I'll go back to you I'll go back to
the early 90s and exactly what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about those high times back in the
days they were only held at from my
[SPEAKER_02]: recollection they were only held in
Amsterdam and like they had the AK-47 the
[SPEAKER_02]: bubblegum all these fucking gnarly ass
strains and like I probably go back and
[SPEAKER_02]: get the original cut of bubblegum or
something dude like that's I don't know I
[SPEAKER_02]: think that but at the same time I never
really smoked the original bubblegum then
[SPEAKER_02]: they have been there the Indiana bubble
gum so I don't know but I'll go back to
[SPEAKER_02]: that time frame and I'll go back to
Amsterdam and I'll be able to smoke all
[SPEAKER_02]: those fucking strains and figure out
exactly what was what and then I would
[SPEAKER_02]: cross some of those to some newer strains
that maybe yield more or you know maybe do
[SPEAKER_02]: better indoors or whatever so I'll
probably go back to the time frame being
[SPEAKER_02]: 90 3 to 95 and then Amsterdam yeah but I'm
old dude who knows like I'm old apparently
[SPEAKER_02]: that's cool I like that like I was just
fucking born then dude but yeah but
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some bomb ass hazes back then too
you know you know five all this stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a ton of shit you can get back in
the days like building blocks to today's
[SPEAKER_02]: weed you know I'm saying like pre cookies
pre etc like I think that would be the
[SPEAKER_02]: dopest time to go back to I think that was
when I just started blasting off
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for indoor so yeah that's the
time frame hugely hugely so I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: just about brings us to the end of it for
this one were there any general comments
[SPEAKER_02]: or shout outs you wanted to make I think I
