[SPEAKER_03]: Hello and welcome back to part two of our
chat with the crew from White Buffalo
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking all things Canadian history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Land race strains and so much more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get back into it, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed you work with seed banks,
but you also sell via your own site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen that this is becoming a more
increasingly popular option for a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sort of wondering, do you think
we're moving to like a direct sales model
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually with breeder and customer,
or do you think seed banks will always be
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of the mainstay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, I don't know, I hate to say
it, but I think eventually it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be an all legal model.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a lot easier to get, you know,
get into the system and create legal
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can do, you can create legal
seeds in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to go through and get a,
you know, you have to have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: money to invest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, at some point it's going to
be more like garden seeds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't be valuable to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be like a tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when we get to that spot,
when everything is fucking hemp fiber and
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp bricks everywhere and weed plants
everywhere, you know, it'll be like a
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato or a strawberry or anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just going to be like,
think of how there's so many, there's been
[SPEAKER_00]: so many new breeders in the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just exploded, like the amount
of breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's only, you know,
you only need so many, like there's only,
[SPEAKER_00]: the market's only buying so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at some point it's just,
it's just going to be all legal because
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll just be the path of least
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really is no, you know, most
countries, there's not a way to sell seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: legally, but in Canada there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see how in the future that'll
just be a model for everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there'll be, like I know most places
now, most countries now that are
[SPEAKER_00]: legalizing or whatever have med programs,
there's a way for, to get cannabis into
[SPEAKER_00]: the legal seed registration program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's the, I think it's like United
Nations seed program and every country in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world has their version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just have to put cannabis in
there more or less, but then like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts of complications with politics
and what I understand, like you can't,
[SPEAKER_00]: like right now you can't really export
stuff around the world because everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: got quotas for like in the recreational
side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the UN won't allow a recreational
export, but there's medical export.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, I think eventually there's
just going to be like, everything's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be open at some point, but we're just
like going through growing pains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, growing pains are really extreme
growing pains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think you'll be able to
continue your operation in approximately
[SPEAKER_03]: the same sort of way it is now going
forward with legalization or do you sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of fear the big ag moving in type of
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's happening is like we were
talking about Pink Kush, the end of Pink
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, the end of the Pink Kush era.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys, when they hit the wall,
the Pink Kush is not selling anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of them are saying,
well, what do I got to do to become,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a legal commercial license?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it happened a decade ago in the
medical side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of guys were growing black
market, had no intention of joining the
[SPEAKER_00]: system and getting like a medical license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at that time it was like,
at the very beginning, you could only get
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it was hard to get it more than a few
plants, like a license.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the licenses whereby basically by
plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but like over the past 10 years that
is like, things have loosened up and doc,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's like these like gray
area kind of doctors that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: or even like nurses, nurse practitioners
that, you know, they understand how the
[SPEAKER_00]: law works and how we have to do to,
to get licenses for like a bunch of people
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, like like a much higher
plant counts than what was previously
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, like the whole like Pink Kush
thing exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys need to figure out,
like they, they were hesitant back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medical days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were hesitant about getting licensed
through the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually everyone did eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like no, even the holdouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, I'm never going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like the hardest, the hardest old
timers that would like, they would,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like the most anti like
establishment guys, like they all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: got licenses because it's like in
California when they had the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: their medical program, it just,
the doctors figured out how, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to disseminate a whole bunch of
licenses and get a bunch of money for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same deal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's money to be made,
you know, you can sell out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: get a bunch of licenses to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like it was, you know, it all comes
down to like how easy, like how much of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pain in the ass is it to get a license
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've just made it like really easy
to get a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really no reason not to get a
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like in the future, I think that it's
going to be the same way for commercial,
[SPEAKER_00]: like commercial cannabis licenses in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just be like they've, we've already
seen it in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: The program started in 2013, our legal
recreation, like our legal commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was MMR originally.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was basically our legal commercial
framework started in 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like initially those first guys that
got into the system, like there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of big guys that got into the system
initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like a bunch of those early guys
that got into the system had no idea or
[SPEAKER_00]: they were trying to get into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had no idea what the hell,
you know, like what they needed to do
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were like, everything was
kind of like big, like they had,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was just a new system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hard to get information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, there was a lot of like money
that was wasted and it was just costing
[SPEAKER_00]: millions and millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now like nowadays for $15,000 for like
$15,000, basically you needed to have at
[SPEAKER_00]: least $15,000 for one year to get your
like micro cultivation license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a facility that's like up to spec,
but the, for the micro guys, the
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements are a lot more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like it took a while to get these micro
licenses as part of the Canadian system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, now that they've introduced
them and now that they're like pumping out
[SPEAKER_00]: the license, it's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's, and you can, there's guys
selling like out application, like an
[SPEAKER_00]: application template, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just like fill in your stuff and go
get your license.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pumping out four to eight licenses
a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like standard and micro cultivation
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like 800 and some licensees
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, eventually like I can see,
but I mean, it's going to be the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like is, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only so much weed that can be
grown and sold like within our market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't, the recreational market
can't right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't export any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can only export medical stuff and it
generally has to be like EU compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's a lot of it's going to Europe
and then there's some going to Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, there are definitely a few
Australians who have been the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the beneficiaries of the Canadian system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think nowadays there's, there's
quite a few facilities online in
[SPEAKER_03]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's some options out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did want to take a moment to jump over
to the legendary Roberts Creek Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Relating to this one, I believe it
originated from one of your good buddies,
[SPEAKER_03]: Vision Creator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's pretty tight with you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you be able to give us a bit of a
backstory on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll start off the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was working with Three Four Man,
when we were in Amsterdam, we were hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: out with Dubie and Kaiki from Canada and
AC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had like, we had established like a
bit of a, you know, a friendship there
[SPEAKER_00]: previous to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just decided to trade some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we got back to Canada,
they sent some seeds and the Congo was one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Three Four Man passed it along to
Vision Creator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Scabby was actually working with
Vision Creator at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they started those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we were like doing big outdoor
grows at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing like two, 3000 plants at a time and
grabbing all kinds of genetics and just
[SPEAKER_01]: going through bam, bam, bam.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole basement was filled with
different fennels and I'd wake up every
[SPEAKER_01]: day and like grab a different fennel or
something to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really fun times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that Congo plant that came out was one
of the best in that year with the Trinity
[SPEAKER_01]: cat was something that really reminded me
of like in the same kind of realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we did them the same year and they
were like back and back like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rest is history, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Robbie has spread the word of the Congo
and I mean, it's a really good plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a pretty wicked beginner Sativa
high, I like to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, people like that lemon boot
policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sexy.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's a good plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think more people should grow it,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually wasn't familiar with it until I
was at a good friend of the show,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Bob Hemphill.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was at his house and he pulled out a jar
and he only really has good weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: so to speak, you know, like really cool
old school stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, what's this?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, oh, it's the Congo,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember being very impressed by the
bud structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very bulky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said to me that like he had heard
rumours it might have been crossed with an
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghani or some sort of Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we submitted that one to Philos and
it didn't link up with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you grow it out and you grow the
crosses, you see like you see what's in
[SPEAKER_01]: something like, you know, you can tell if
it's been crossed with an African.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've crossed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've crossed it with so many things like
so many Sativas that if, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we grew out a bunch of them,
you'd think we'd hit something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we've never never come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like all the seeds we put out there
with Congo Sativa crosses is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we never get anyone coming back saying,
hey, this is the start.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you think like it's just really truly
like a special fast flowering and the
[SPEAKER_03]: structure just it's like, you know,
just really one of a kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like after growing a lot of Africans
and it's in that time frame, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like really high on the terpene,
which is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like the terpene, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I'm sure there's fucking
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were what were the the siblings of
that?
Like.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I can't even remember, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it like really, really crazy hempy
phenos?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were there were some phenos that
were very Medusa headed and spread out for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like stuff with running calyxes and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the like the high end terpene content
of that plant is what makes it really
[SPEAKER_01]: special.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And why do you think it's like got this
real cult following, but hasn't quite
[SPEAKER_03]: truly broke through to the mainstream
quite yet?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I remember when I tried it,
I was like, this is some of the best weed
[SPEAKER_03]: I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yet I myself hadn't heard of it like
10 minutes prior to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I was a bit like,
you know, I know a lot of strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it really makes me feel a bit caught
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you think it's not more well known?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's got its own special enigma,
like it decides where it wants to go and
[SPEAKER_00]: who wants to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people that aren't supposed to be
growing it, maybe they lose their plants
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've been sending cuts down to the
States for years and it should be all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, one thing I figured out
about Canada over the years, because we've
[SPEAKER_00]: had this, you know, more of a protective
environment or more of a tolerant
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, like in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because everyone like it's more of an
indoor dominated society, we've just got
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more conducive to saving cuttings
because there's everyone's pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's got a room or like a light
going year round, you know, or during,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's just, it's easier for cuts
to circulate in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think there may be in the States,
you know, it's more, there'll be more
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems like there's just more cuts
being held or just like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the amount of people we have here,
you know, our population's 10% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have a high proportion of,
you know, people holding cuts just because
[SPEAKER_00]: they can, you know, you got a spot to hold
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less cuts being lost basically,
what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And out of curiosity, have you guys ever
grown out any like S1s of it and sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: seen what that had inside it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but that's like a dream that's like
right here in front of us right now at
[SPEAKER_01]: this moment in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll get there soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, are you doing a FEM right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, I'm just starting to experiment
with some, some feminization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm, I did some feminine,
I've done some feminization in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just don't like the, the chemistry
of silver biosulphate because it's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of sodium in the mix, like the
actual chemistry you mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sodium thiosulphate and silver,
silver nitrate and the molecules swap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have silver thiosulphate,
but also in the same solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have sodium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time you're spraying your plants
with, it's not like, I'm not, I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to like be critical of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just for me, like I'm into,
I'm interested in chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to try I just want to try some
other alternate formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've tried, I just tried instead of
sodium thiosulphate, I thought to myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, let's try calcium thiosulphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we made silver thiosulphate and
then the other molecule is calcium nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: that it makes in the same solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're like, when you make sodium,
when you make a silver thiosulphate,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a co, it's like a co-solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like two solutions going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't separate out the sodium
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and just, I'm just wondering in my
mind, I'm just curious, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we can, maybe there's cause like,
from what I understand, like I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of experience with the reversals,
but I did enough just to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: to know how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, in my mind, like I want,
I just want to try a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: other silver molecules because like the,
the basic theory is that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get as much, you're trying to get a bunch
of silver loaded into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get, when you reach a
critical amount of silver, that's when the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant starts, like the hormones start
flipping and they start producing hormones
[SPEAKER_00]: for, you know, to make male flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm trying a bunch of different
silver formulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just made, made silver citrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took silver nitrate, converted it
into silver oxide with like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: with lye, sodium hydroxide, and then mix
that with the citric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it made a citric, a silver
citrate in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm just going to try making
a bunch of these molecules and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the first one I tried, this silver
biosulphate calcium nitrate solution
[SPEAKER_00]: worked out pretty good, but it's a calcium
nitrate is a double, it's a double vegging
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So calcium is a veg nutrient and nitrate
is a veg nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like hitting a flowering plant
with a double veg nutrient is not really
[SPEAKER_00]: helping it want to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to like, I'm going to try this
silver citrate next, just to, I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to try it just to see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll, I'll just spray the other
stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to compare the reactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any specific concerns about
using a standard STS solution that you
[SPEAKER_03]: hope to overcome by using this alternative
one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in my mind, my concern is by
spraying the plant with silver sodium,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant does not want to take up sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe it's going to be like not,
you know, it's not fully going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to upload that silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also like, it's just not healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if we have the option of not
spraying sodium onto the plant and we,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, can we choose that option?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that possible?
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds pretty reasonable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, I actually had a discussion with a
friend of mine the other day and we were
[SPEAKER_03]: linking some papers to each other and
there's, there's actually a few different
[SPEAKER_03]: chemicals you can use.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also use a cobalt chloride
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're okay with chloride, if you're
okay with cobalt and chloride,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's also another molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like three methyl heptanone or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know which ones you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones are, yeah, I'm not interested
in that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what about just, just straight up
colloidal silver?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I've heard that that's not super
reliable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is less, less effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to spray it more often and for
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to spray it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other molecules I want to try are,
what was the next one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Silver, silver by glycinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never been, as far as I've,
as far as I understand, it's never been,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's never been synthesized before.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like it's chelated with two
glycines, which is amino acid.
Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you can go to the health
food store and get all your minerals now
[SPEAKER_00]: as by glycinate, calcium by glycinate,
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured out, I think I figured out
the path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think you got to, you got to make
silver oxide and then, and then do a swap
[SPEAKER_00]: between silver oxide and glycine in
solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also heard you can use just
gibberellic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that one's also not super reliable
from what I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but I've like, I've heard something I
heard like back in the day is you spray
[SPEAKER_00]: your, your GA before you spray your silver
or after like one of the two, and it like
[SPEAKER_00]: gives a boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives a boost to the silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard that it can increase the pollen
rates because the gibberellic acid,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know how you've got like a pollen
cluster, it like, it causes it all to
[SPEAKER_03]: elongate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll shoot, it'll shoot the,
like it'll spread the, the, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the stamens apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it probably helps with the ejection of
the pollen to, to get it out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stamen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like when I was just doing some
experiments there, I, one of the plants I
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed, it wasn't like ejecting pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but when I dried it and crushed it in
my fingertips, there's a bunch of pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: there on my fingertips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked at it under a scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at the inside of that stamen
and the inside of the stamen, it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a geode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a crystal geode, but just
covered with pollen grains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the whole inside of those stamen
are growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like a, a layer of pollen
growing on the inside of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one, one of the plants I sprayed,
they just weren't detaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just didn't have enough oomph to
finish the, like to finish the maturation
[SPEAKER_00]: and like crystallize so that the shit can
like detach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And out of interest for our listeners,
are there any specific sort of feminized
[SPEAKER_03]: projects you're hoping to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like any, like kind of, like, you know,
so I think you've alluded that the Roberts
[SPEAKER_03]: Creek Congo, you're going to reverse that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we might see some hybrids with that in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically we're going to reverse
everything and cross it to everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every permutation possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that, everything that,
everything that's tested, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like tested cuttings that we have in our
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got like a 50, we keep like 50 cuts
at a time generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like, we like to get like,
occasionally we get rid of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll purge a bunch of stuff that you
know, like just, I just like to get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, this stuff is good,
but like, you know, we have other stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's better in that particular category
or like it's, we did some breeding with it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it wasn't a good breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, yeah, get it out of here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So given you've got this like incredible
collection of females, but not necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: having been able to cross them together,
but now being able to, which two females
[SPEAKER_03]: are you really excited to see?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the offspring of all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a silly question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you start doing this, you realize
that you can make good, good choices by
[SPEAKER_01]: having good goals to go towards,
you know, getting used to knowing the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and what you're doing and how they
grow and what you want to add to that or
[SPEAKER_01]: take away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's really, I mean, you got to
do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing is like the coolest
comes out of the most unexpected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you should, you just got to grow
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like basically that's what you got to do
as a, as someone that's looking for stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is you just got to grow everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you can get your hands on,
throw it all and smoke it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like keep the best and then grow
them again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you got to grow everything
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke it all again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before it gets into the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good recipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So out of curiosity, I noticed you guys,
it got the Congo Creek haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you recommend it for someone like
myself who loves the Congo and wants to
[SPEAKER_03]: have something similar to that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think the haze is like,
you know, quite dominant and maybe there's
[SPEAKER_03]: an alternative cross you offer where you
get a bit more of that Congo?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't mind, like they can go
between like 11 to 15 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't mind running that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would highly recommend the haze Congo
Creek haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the Congo for me has a short
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the duration of the high isn't very
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that might be like something
to do with plants in that time frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a faster finishing plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't expect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that makes sense for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, so that haze it has that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Longer legs high on it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That long creative high for a musician or
a writer or a dancer or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to get into that place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a bit more complexity into the
flavors too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, there's, there's such like the
Congo has such a cult following that
[SPEAKER_00]: people, they just want the Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of people just, they just want
that Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want like, no, if you said
Congo haze to them, they would like slap
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, no, I just want the Congo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not that much of a purist.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be interested to know though,
given you guys have grown such a wide
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity of, you know, equatorial strains
and various sativas, do you have any sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of tips for people to grow them indoors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I know that I've got this friend,
he's an older guy and he grows a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: Thai and he puts heating mats under his
pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, when I asked him about it,
he goes, Oh, I think I'm replicating the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil temperature of the equatorial
regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, that's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any weird, fun, creative tips you've got
at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't necessarily agree with that
because a lot of the equatorial stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: grown out elevation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, uh, like they might,
they might be some of those spots like
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily super warm there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you go into Bogota is fucking cold as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, not cold as fuck, but it's
like, uh, what was Medellin is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the eternal spring.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, uh, yeah, but it did get pretty
cold there in the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those Colombian, uh, the guys that are
growing are like up in the hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely up in the hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those Colombian genetics add a lot of
hardiness into anything we throw them
[SPEAKER_01]: into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the things the biosphere
of Columbia has presented great genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: for our use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, do you have any other tips
for people to do indoor sativas?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think DJ Short says he likes to do
instead of 12, 12, like 11, 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you do anything different like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you just approach it straight forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what I like to do is,
um, do the first eight weeks on a 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after eight weeks, flip it down
to, uh, uh, 11, 13, uh, and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and then for a couple of weeks and
then, and then down to like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, 14 for it to the finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, yeah, cause they, you know,
they're not, they're not going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: finish, uh, like in, uh, eight weeks
early, you know, there's no real advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: to flip in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're flipping the light down until like
after eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tip is to try and get your plants
down to 10, 14, um, because otherwise
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just going to keep spitting out
pistols, a lot of those tropical plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I hear that a lot from guests that
they have strains that'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get it down to 10, 14 or,
or 11, 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more it wants to keep flowering,
the more you have to reduce it basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like some plants, they just want,
they just need like 20 weeks or 22 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's just nothing you can do about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The slow burn.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the questions I like to ask all of
the guests we have on who have like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, quite diverse seed libraries is
what seeds in your library are like the
[SPEAKER_03]: most special to you and what ones are you
most keen to run?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, that's a tough question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for me, I always like, uh,
I have these seeds called Rapa Nui,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Easter Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always like, emphasized about
something special coming out of that in a
[SPEAKER_01]: weird way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, for me, yeah, that's something
that we really want to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like really hard to, like I was
saying the weird, the coolest shit comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the weirdest places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just don't, I mean, definitely the
tropical stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause that's what we like to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great eyes and the great creative
eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, yeah, it's just the,
I think as we move forward as like a
[SPEAKER_01]: people, you know, we'll evolve a finer
taste, the cannabis kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the way we do with wine and it'll
become more socially acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we'll get to share these
things more often, you know, as people
[SPEAKER_01]: proliferate those genes more and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while we're on the topic of growing
from a question or two ago, I haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: asked you guys yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: What style of growing do you use?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you soil, are you soil-less,
cocoa hydro?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your preferred method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cocoa, two thirds cocoa, one third per
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we make our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our own compost and we, uh, pre-mix the
compost, uh, like one to 10 or one to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight or whatever into that mix and,
uh, test it, get a soil test and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, just a bit, just do basically water
only, but, uh, maybe throw in a few things
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be needed along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep it as simple as possible
because, um, as we grow so many plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're, we're growing everything in the
same mix from like the craziest sativas,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, to like the most like sensitive
sativas, um, to like the most,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, hungriest, uh, Indica's things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, but what we figured out is we
just got a, the more sensitive stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll just put less compost into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, they all seem to like,
uh, the, the plants, like people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plants are like people,
they all seem to like, uh, a certain,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, type of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're all, they all seem to be
reasonably happy with the same like meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just, we just try to keep it
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our compost is made from, uh, a bunch of
the old cocoa mix as the bulking medium as
[SPEAKER_00]: the, like the browns, the carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we, um, we get a bunch of like,
uh, alfalfa, uh, soy meal, soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like six rock phosphate, fish bone
meal, Delamite lime, high calcium lime,
[SPEAKER_00]: gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then a bunch of the old compost,
we'll throw that in there and like 5% as
[SPEAKER_00]: an inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we were using, uh, we made some,
IMOs, like KNF style IMOs to inoculate the
[SPEAKER_00]: compost piles before with just like,
uh, indigenous microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: IMOs from our forest around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, lately we've been, we take a
bunch of like sulfate trace minerals and
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolve them in water and then mix them
into biochar and throw that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty like, pretty complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't really, it's not like a method
I recommend that people try as,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, unless they really want to
experiment, but, uh, we've been like
[SPEAKER_00]: experimenting for, uh, like 15 years on
various recipes, but we're finally like
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, the latest recipe is like super
close to, um, to where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, like the last, uh, three years we
figured out how to, like the, like where
[SPEAKER_00]: the recipe needs to be to, to,
um, totally, uh, impervious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previous to powdery mildew, like the,
like our plants don't grow, like they,
[SPEAKER_00]: they won't grow powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, like, we basically figured out
when you get a soil test, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something called a base saturation for
the, the cations, cation based saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like your calcium, there's the
cation exchange sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they basically, they, they measure,
um, how much of each of those ions,
[SPEAKER_00]: each of those cations is on the,
those cation exchange sites, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, they measure calcium,
potassium, magnesium, uh, sodium and
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, uh, what we figured out is to,
like, what worked for us is to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium number as like insanely high as
possible and, and to use a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: different calcium sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got like seven different types of
calcium in our mix, which includes the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the rock phosphate as a source of
calcium and the fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the stuff that has a lot of calcium
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, according to Kerry Reams,
um, he was saying that there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different calcium molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like nice to have all those
different calcium molecules available for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very comprehensive, but yeah, it's still
organic and thus a man after my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you opened up with, uh, Coco,
I was like, okay, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting ready for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, uh, fish this time of year,
you know, we're on the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take some fish and throw it in a
bucket and make some for a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, let it eat up and, you know,
so we have the local stuff is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we try to get our stuff as local
as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to, um, trying to close the
loop as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to quickly ask you, what's the
backstory on the BC mango?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there's a breeder in Australia,
his name is Ski Mask Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, he's worked at a few generations and
he's doing some fun stuff with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was sort of interested to hear,
uh, the backstory on it and what sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: traits do you remember it having?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, I've never grown out that
particular hybrid, but, uh, I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: Tescos of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it is the cross is drum roll,
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: The female was Dutch passion mango was a
Dutch passion that had the mango.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it might've been Casey brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey brains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a, uh, a BC, like a BC selected
cut or like a Vancouver Island selected
[SPEAKER_00]: cut of, of the mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, a guy named detox in like,
uh, mid Vancouver Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he crossed it with cream Sotica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew out a bunch of those and we just,
there's like, those things are all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like I said, that cream Sotica.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give you every variation of color
possible leaf color, bud color,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, all sorts of like, they're really
dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's cream Sotica crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're, they're really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they look nice and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is not like super strong or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, we selected out, uh,
a semi auto funnel of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like super hard to keep in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super hard to keep in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you would put it out,
it just wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was like the mighty might.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd put it out and it would only grow,
uh, like three feet tall or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all intents and purposes, it was auto
firing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I classified as semi auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, that was, that was the female
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we crossed that with,
uh, uh, Northern lights that came from
[SPEAKER_00]: Steve Tuck and Steve Tuck used to work in
Holland for, I believe he worked for,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, sensei or.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he, he claimed he had like,
uh, a good and online and it seemed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they like that, that, that particular
and all line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it outdoors in BC and it actually
like this should actually worked outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it actually, uh, had good mold
resistance and was relatively early.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another, another cutting from back in the
day, the UBC chemo, that was like a real
[SPEAKER_03]: famous Canadian clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you occasionally see people bring
it up today, but not too many people have
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what made that cut unique,
you know, and, and how would you describe
[SPEAKER_03]: it to people?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never tried it or smells it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got no idea what it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would call it a wheelchair weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it didn't have a lot of character,
but it had a good medicinal properties,
[SPEAKER_00]: like very narcoleptic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, green apple,
sour green apple kind of.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're kind of like, they look like,
it looked like a Nepalese cross to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd really like, uh, serrated sharp,
uh, thin leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was two photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a short photo from Montreal and
then the West.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but that's not, that has nothing to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another chemo in, in Montreal
that like kind of confused the situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was like unrelated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ironically, it came from BC from some,
some dreaded Deadman Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what they said?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Denman Island, but the French guy kept
saying Deadman Island.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, Denman Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any other Canadian genetics that
you think deserve more of a rep,
[SPEAKER_03]: but have never really got the attention
they merit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of stuff that's
extinct that we can't even say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like that queen, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and some of those hash plants are
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not like a lot of this stuff
back then was a little bit rougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, it's like tops out at 20%
or 20, whatever percent THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, the, this, you know,
the stocks, the trichome stocks are
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller, you know, like they're not the,
this really flashy weed from today with
[SPEAKER_00]: really long trichome stocks that like bend
over and reflect the light really well and
[SPEAKER_00]: like cover all the foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all you see are like these shiny
trichomes, you know, trichome stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so yeah, just on the, like the
cannabinoid ratio and the way it looks and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not as, it's not as nice in the
bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's definitely evolved for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the flavors were different back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the hash plant was really rancid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like rancid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a popcorn parts and it just reminded
me of like something like rancid oils or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like rancid socks, stinky old
rancid socks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say pee pants, but I didn't
want to bring pee in for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The God, the old God bud is kind of a cool
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the Jordan God bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a, it's like an Af County
purse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he had like a Sensi Afghan,
Afghan one or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they had, there was an old cut called
perps that was from the Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an Afghan or Pakistani or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would finish outside, but it's like
not, it's, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got nice medicinal qualities,
but today it would just be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, you know, people would more or
less would pass it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cause it's not like super flashy
and tight buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harder to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like super loud or anything,
but anyways, Jordan, I believe did the
[SPEAKER_00]: cross and the back cross with that County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then came up with this, a selection
called the Jordan's God bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one's like super stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was popular for about five
minutes before everyone realized it was
[SPEAKER_00]: the stinkiest plant going and everyone's
and it was a really, really low,
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger to veg it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just took a long time to veg your
plants up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was, it was super stinky and it had
a nice rancid old man pea pants with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with grape.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice grape flavors in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I've had some nice God bud before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just grown from seed, probably not the
select clone, but it was nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to say, but I did want to ask you,
cause I've been wondering about this
[SPEAKER_03]: forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a bit of a throwback one for you,
C Ray, but the gorilla gold, that's,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's an interesting strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you were a part of the creation of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were you like, if, if so, can you give me
some of the backstory on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And as just a quick followup, I read
rumors online that it involved mighty
[SPEAKER_03]: might in the breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually scabby notice more about that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mighty mighty Afghan would be mighty
mighty Afghan early gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a mighty mighty Afghan and
just talk about the mighty mighty Afghan
[SPEAKER_00]: seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I guess the mighty might was growing
around here a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very tiny little short plant
and yeah, it would grow like three feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a semi auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you keep your mum and veg, make a bunch
of cuts, throw them out and they'd only
[SPEAKER_00]: grow like three foot, one big stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could grow it in a bunch of pots
and put it in, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a drip system outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it finished really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the quicker ones that people
did so they could get it off to the
[SPEAKER_01]: market, but it didn't last very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, the guys were throwing the
Afghanis around, uh, at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, uh, yeah, they, they had that,
was it, you think it was, uh, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: the auto Afghan from sensei seeds that
they threw into that, or was it just cause
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a mighty might?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to say because they were like
dead, grateful head, grateful bed,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, hippies that just use
various names like this is Afghan,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it could be, you know, but yeah,
anyways, they had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a, there was a seed line that was
circulating around the, the, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: northern Gulf islands of mighty might
Afghan that they didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it got crossed into this,
uh, early goal cutting, which was a
[SPEAKER_01]: Himalayan and it flowered really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a very sparse bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it would be one of the first ones
we would cut down and you're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: the early goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The early goal talking about the Himalayan
side of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where did that come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: A guy in Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all I know about it, but I,
all I know is Himalayan and it made one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, most, uh, soupiest hashes like
melthiest ashes you've ever seen it,
[SPEAKER_01]: like stick to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the guys were just trying to find stuff
that would finish outside here and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, mixing all this stuff together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The early Bramble became there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first generation of gorilla gold was
called early Bramble by a Texas Island
[SPEAKER_00]: chief company that released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Camaro Rick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was, it was Texas Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: See how many patches that, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patchwork seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, through my memory seed and kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the first generation of the
gorilla gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it got passed to Breeder Brad in
Ontario and he did some work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then he passed it to a guy in
Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we went by greens on a forum called
unleash the green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he sent, he, uh, sent me some
seeds and I did some work with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of funny because it's
originated here and then went across
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada to the same spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty close to Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was also curious to know your,
in one of your crosses, you use an Island
[SPEAKER_03]: purple Indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you happen to know, is that the same
one that goes around like Washington and
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon?
[SPEAKER_03]: The it's just called purple Indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, uh, uh, inspector grows it,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they call it, they call it the
perps or the Vancouver Island perps or the
[SPEAKER_00]: Vancouver Island purple Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that it's just, it's just a
generic name, you know, purple Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's like a thousand purple
Indica cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got really awesome candy smell and
taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, yeah, it's just, um,
it's one of those plants that's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, real hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pain in the ass to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, there's a lot of easier
things to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like a later finishing outdoor
plant back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just too late of a finisher
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's still, it's still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the old ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably from the nineties,
if I had to guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still people growing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of ones from the nineties,
early two thousands, I think you're
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in the Willie Nelson with reefer
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is, is that true at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I guess as a general follow-up,
whether that's true or not, it's a pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: popular strain from everything I read,
but like no one really seems to hold onto
[SPEAKER_03]: it anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know why that might be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, when you grow the seeds,
you know, there's, um, variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we, we got the, we got the cup
winning cup out of like growing a few F
[SPEAKER_00]: ones, like a couple of packs or two or
three packs F ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, there's some good cuts in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the lemony ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, yeah, the, the sort of like
beautiful rusty lemonade or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some, uh, there's some ones that I
classify as old lady perfume.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got this, uh, like, uh,
very floral smell, but with this electric,
[SPEAKER_00]: like lemon, juice smell in there,
there's definitely some good ones in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the PM resistance wasn't the,
wasn't the best on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that may, I don't know if
that's part of it, but also there,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, there was people don't hang
onto stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more than 10 weeks flowering,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably a large part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never liked that Vietnamese black
mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're, they're all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's definitely some good ones in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we, you know, we also sent around
that, uh, the, the, the cup cut and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like, I don't, you know, that was a
long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, things, things get lost over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I was saying in the States,
uh, um, it's harder to, I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: harder to keep cuts around there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from the breeding point of view,
how do you go about testing your males?
[SPEAKER_03]: One of our listeners was wondering,
and specifically they wanted to know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like with the hazes, cause you can see on
your Instagram that you flower the boys
[SPEAKER_03]: out and you really like to look at them
and that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess they're sort of wondering,
given that some of these hazes can go a
[SPEAKER_03]: long time, is there another way you do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you just like rough it out and
you're like, I've got to flower this thing
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we, uh, when we initially grew
those, there was six males and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, like we, we like to do a good
flowering of them and then just,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then constantly smelling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause those males are just constantly
changing smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we just like get it right,
get right in there and smell them,
[SPEAKER_00]: like try and get in there at the peak
flowering, um, like just constantly smell
[SPEAKER_00]: them every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it's pretty obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you grow the females,
like the whole, the whole idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, doing selections and inbreeding and
like trying to pair the ones together that
[SPEAKER_00]: you like is, uh, you grow the females
first and you find the females you like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you try and like get a good
handle on what the smells coming off those
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go look at your males and,
uh, try and just try and match up those
[SPEAKER_00]: smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, from the point of view,
trying to find the best, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the best smells that might correlate to it
was like the hyzer that you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so we, uh, we had six initially,
and then we selected three out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, we just crossed those like
those three males we crossed to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other hyzer phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but then we, um, we, we still had the
original three males and then we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we stuck the three males outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were basically those, those six
males, they segregated into two,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was two types.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say two types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one that was more lemon grassy and
grassy, like the lawn smelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, those were the ones that we
didn't favor and the ones that we favored
[SPEAKER_00]: are more citrusy, uh, uh, like tropical
flowery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also had like this crazy onion
smell on them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which apparently I've been told
that's, that's a sign of a true,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a good haze has that onion smell in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there must be some weird, uh,
terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we stuck those three,
uh, males, like clones of those males
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, um, in like September,
um, just to see what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, there was one that was just like,
it looked like it actually liked it
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two were like, yeah,
no, this sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not meant to be growing outdoors in
the coast of BC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the one guy was like, yeah,
this is all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and they were like, we, like,
we grew out some of the, the crosses with
[SPEAKER_00]: all three males and they were all like
good, like the ones that you could tell
[SPEAKER_00]: which ones came from each male,
just on the nodal spacing and like the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the ones that had, they had like
really nice bud structure outdoors and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were flowering, like they're,
the males were flowering pretty decently
[SPEAKER_00]: and they had, they actually had pretty
good, um, mold resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're just, uh, like, it's just a
superior growing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the highs were the same and the
player, like the trips were pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: similar, but yeah, the, the structure and
everything, they're just way superior for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like a little bit faster
finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so eventually we just, uh,
we got rid of the other two haze males and
[SPEAKER_00]: just kept that one to, to breed with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we eventually, um, we crossed out
with, uh, there's a local cutting of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedman original haze, um, from one of our
buddies back in the day that he gave us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we crossed out with the, uh,
original haze or original haze stud male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've just started growing out some of
those and we're going to like continue
[SPEAKER_00]: forward with that as a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just did a, uh, 50, we grew out
like 50 seedlings and there's like 30
[SPEAKER_00]: females in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from those 30, we selected out two,
but one is like superior for high wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're both like, they both smell
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one's a little bit faster,
but, uh, like a little bit longer
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one we're going to use for,
um, for doing some feminize crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we've done a bunch of these
crosses with original haze males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we want to replicate those ones
that worked out good with the,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the female feminize style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You actually managed to bang off a few
questions I was going to ask you about
[SPEAKER_03]: what can we look forward to in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we've just got a few Patreon
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get to the final little quick
fire ones we do with everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be interested to hear your answer to
this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you've got such a vast experience
with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the best outdoor variety to you
and what makes a strain good for outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: from your perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's good enough to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of outdoor stuff is in this day
and age.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the standard is the standard is
way higher than it was for us back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we're going to have a tough spot
for growing and really we should just be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing everything in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's, you know, we're,
it's also nice to be able to breed or like
[SPEAKER_00]: grow something that just grows straight
outdoors and gives you a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: quality product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like really, really hard to pull
that off here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to grow a ton of plants and like
you need, you need to grow like thousands,
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of plants to ultimately like to
come up with a good, like really good
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's worth growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That ticks all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of outdoor stuff is just
developed just to be a mold resistant,
[SPEAKER_00]: like good enough to finish and make it,
you know, good looking product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good medicine and stuff, but,
um, it's not what people expect in this
[SPEAKER_01]: day and age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are just are over the whole outdoor
thing died.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a really big community thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want their quads and their,
their pence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of just faded away with the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely a sentiment we've heard from
other guests as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ironically in the legal market,
there's now eight hectares of outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grown, grown for every hectare of indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the legal market is, uh, I think a lot
of it just gets turned into oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a, like the carts, the carts are
huge in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like the markups on carts are
insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in your opinion, what are some of the
best varieties you guys offer for flower
[SPEAKER_03]: and what are the best for hash?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got some concentrate enthusiasts in
our Patreon crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, what, what would you
recommend for flower and what would you
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend for hash just in terms of your
personally, what you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all the, uh, all the new Irene,
um, sorry, all the new Iraqi crosses are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting good, uh, good reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grew a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like it all depends how I,
when people ask me, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always ask first, uh, how many,
which, you know, what do you like to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, what do you like to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how many weeks are you willing to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're into longer flower and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just, you know, we try to have a
little bit of indica, like faster flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, but our main focus is,
uh, like longer flower and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I don't know if you're like,
the question is, you know, are you,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you willing, are you a Sativa
enthusiast or, you know, are you Sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: curious?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can break it down like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could break it down like a Sativa
strains and hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't yield very well, so they're not
going to be put into the market at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: People aren't going to try them a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like a labor of love kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have these fancy glassy cushions
that make really good ash returns,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so you could, you could break it
up like that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we haven't like, we haven't washed,
uh, we haven't washed any of these Iraqi
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I want to, but we're going to do,
um, we got a, we got a GMO and a form cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll do Iraqi, uh, GMO form process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure those will wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can probably can't not wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't, we don't, uh, like we're
not, like we're not making hash,
[SPEAKER_00]: so, um, we're not washing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not really our focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of live resin right now,
so we get to, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some point, like it's, it's
definitely, uh, something that we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is, is a lot of people are asking for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, have to start washing a
bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I'm trying to get stuff to
people that want to do those test washes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's people out there that
want to do test washes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll slip you some test seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, please everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can get in touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, one of our listeners said,
um, be sure to ask Siray, what's the
[SPEAKER_03]: backstory on his Jamaican?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a Scabby story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it came from a friend who was at the
first, uh, Jamaican cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it won the first Jamaican cannabis cup
2006 or 2006 or seven, somewhere around
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Negril, uh, uh, the seat came out of the
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the guy's name was, uh,
Biggie or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the beach or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's brought it back to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was a bunch of Benos and they
all went to Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all really had that pineapple stunky
smell, but one of them had the high too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ended up keeping the one with the good
high and the funky smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the only plant that like really
stinks and bitch for me, like really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really fucking reeks, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it's going to really complex,
interesting smell, but a beautiful plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: not a big yielder, but, um, this really
good bud, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you want to experience
something different, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, super potent, super potent too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It whacks you right in the third eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like getting hit with a baseball bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that shit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that cross with the puna.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is some of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making me remember now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, uh, they're really,
um, for skunks, they have some really
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful, uh, uh, Rudy and floral,
uh, there's smells in there like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like Barry smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, nice, uh, rotting, uh,
like watermelons or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super strong weed, super good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you ever get a chance, definitely
grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to confirm, cause I've seen you
describe it on the side as, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: with the word skunky in there,
the pineapple skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that it's like, uh,
a Jamaican quote land race that sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: happens to be like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think it's some sort of hybrid
European influx?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, there's no such thing like
nowadays as a Jamaican land race.
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is, uh, I mean, from what I can tell,
there's guys save seed there and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, they don't, um, there's not
a lot of stuff left over from the glory
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they take what works and what they
like, and they keep moving forward with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the major mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, there's like some of them
have, had the kicker high and some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it boiled down to really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a mix of, uh, you know,
various hybrids American.
[SPEAKER_03]: So another one of our listeners asked,
would they be able to tell us a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: about the Highland Nepalese father that
was in the ganja wise crosses?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit, I'm not familiar with
what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, ganja wise there, um, some friends of
ours that run some of our stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's, uh, it's just the same,
uh, mail that was used for really Nelson
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not the same, but it was like
dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but yeah, it's a, um, skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's very hashy like skunky,
uh, like, uh, and kind of, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's, it's really, it's like a really
good, uh, representation of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the old school Nepalese shoe hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever had that, um, slightly,
uh, citrusy, um, but it's one of the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one of the best traditional hashes
I've ever had is the Nepalese,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like they call it shoe hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it came, it was part of the shoes
to, uh, like the, what do you call the
[SPEAKER_00]: heel of the shoe or something they would
put, or they, yeah, to press it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let know like they'd smuggle in shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were smuggled as shoes or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've asked you about the original haze and
the gorilla gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one other strain that got brought up a
few times by our listeners was the whitey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell me anything about that at
all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, came from a guy called THC
development and I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on, uh, like unleashed the green
form and, uh, but he was selling it
[SPEAKER_00]: through, um, the, the, uh, retail side of
unleashed the green form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, and it was, uh, he said it was a
white S one, but I like, we grew out these
[SPEAKER_00]: whitey, uh, like they're called whitey and
the guy said it was, uh, the white S ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that he, like he made, like he wrote
some white S ones and he found a male in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he did a backcross back to the
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was able to get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is his story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like as I recall, yeah, he,
he got a white, the white, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting and they have back crossed it with
this male that came out of Kelly
[SPEAKER_00]: connection, the white, uh, S ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, apparently like a lot of S
ones, if you grow enough, there'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: males that pop out, like one out of every
three or 4,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, either it's like a,
like a man, one of those males,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I wouldn't be too surprised because
it was kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some weird things about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we grew, uh, some of those,
they were male, female seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I mean, it could have been just a
pollen contamination too, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a white it's seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be 75% the white, uh,
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew out, uh, I think I got like three
or four packs of those grew out a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we like, out of all those,
we only found like, uh, a couple,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a male and a female that we were,
that we really liked of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we made more seeds, but yeah,
the cool thing was, this is a kind of an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we had this carport, uh, that we were
just keeping, uh, a bunch of our,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, mothers, um, like in the winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had a carport with a light and
like, we just keep the light on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that was enough heat to keep the
thing in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it would go down to, uh, it was down
to like minus 10 here in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, anyway, so I was, uh, we were growing
this carport and, uh, one day I was in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and I'm like, oh, bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some plants getting PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I just kind of ignored it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went back and like,
damn, like there's like PM starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, uh, so busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time that like, I just,
uh, like it wasn't a priority because I,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just like some extra cuttings that
we didn't need, but we had like most of
[SPEAKER_00]: our collection in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, I'm at one point I was like,
yeah, this is kind of a waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was just going to chop them all
down and start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I thought to myself, like,
why don't we just like, let it go and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, see, uh, like let it go and we can
see, um, which plants have the best
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, we can kind of see as we go
along, um, which plants are more resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: because they won't get like, they'll like,
what are the plants that don't like that
[SPEAKER_00]: get PM the lot, you know, like at the very
end, which plants can hold out to the very
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a very, um, very, it was like
the epitome of a stressful environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I saw what was happening,
I was like, yeah, let's just, let's just
[SPEAKER_00]: test all these plants and then see like
the very, the, like the, the various,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, mounted PM resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, yeah, we were able to like,
uh, to, to like classify all the various
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts that we were holding and,
uh, you know, figure out like what's the,
[SPEAKER_00]: where the upper echelon plants for PM
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you just let these plants go off
anyways, in the end, there was a,
[SPEAKER_00]: what our white email was completely PM
resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like so much PM in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was just like, I was like,
so impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this, this is like a hundred
percent PM resistance, at least to the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, like, you know, like powdery mildew,
um, you have what's called races.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the, uh, Washington
state, they have a hops powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, breeding program and they've,
uh, what they do in their breeding program
[SPEAKER_00]: is they have a culture up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're various hop powdery mildew races.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same, same, uh, subspecies of
powdery mildew, but various like ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've clicked off various, uh,
like the different hubs, hubs cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, um, when they're breeding new
hops, they introduce all those six or
[SPEAKER_00]: however many races and they say,
okay, yeah, they can like classify those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and say, this one is resistant to
race one, two, three, and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five, um, but not to six and four or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this is, uh, this whitey was,
uh, like is like completely impervious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, damn, this is fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I never would have,
I never would have figured that out if I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if we didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only the strong survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sent, uh, that we sent, uh,
like some stems of that to, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin McKernan at medicinal genomics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did a full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, genome, um, what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Genomes scan, uh, sequence sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genome sequence on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like plant number 48 to have,
uh, to have its full, uh, genome sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's like public domain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go look at it on a new database.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was part of a paper, uh, I believe like
three years or four years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: With, uh, like the, like it had 47,
we were like, just, we just submitted just
[SPEAKER_00]: after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did a, like, he sent us the whole,
um, the genetic, like the heat map that
[SPEAKER_00]: showed, um, like all the different genes
that they figured were linked to PM and
[SPEAKER_00]: where the up regulating and down
regulating was going on for this whitey
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like unrelated, like you
couldn't, the patterns were different than
[SPEAKER_00]: what they had already as confirmed as PM
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was a little bit skeptical or he was
saying that, um, uh, people, like people
[SPEAKER_00]: were out like questioning him about,
you know, the various people that
[SPEAKER_00]: submitted PM resistance, PM resistant
plants to that, to like that, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: project, um, you know, like what's the,
you know, what's your, uh, standard,
[SPEAKER_00]: your like scientific like research,
uh, grade, uh, standard set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like what's your control,
what's your criteria, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like I, I, unfortunately I didn't
take any pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wish I would have had a bunch of
pictures cause I would have showed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that would have been like
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, so I, just because I didn't have
any pictures, um, uh, it was, it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, he didn't, like he didn't really,
he didn't really, um, I don't know if he
[SPEAKER_00]: believes that it was like fully PM
resistance, but, but, uh, I assure you
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant was PM resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made, um, we made F twos from those
and we haven't like dipped into those,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, but we will at some point dip into
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently like we've sent those,
some of those F twos around and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, people said they're like really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make, um, nice fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like, uh, the whitey kind
of reminds me of that, uh, South Florida
[SPEAKER_00]: OG Kush, uh, you know, it's not like it's,
it's not really, um, no, it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: like a super strong flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a super, like you don't go,
wow, this is amazing, but it works pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: well in hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's, it's kind of falls into one
of those varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of like submissive in crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a good, uh, a good,
uh, male for like, uh, crossing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff too, without like dominating the
cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It almost makes me think that like maybe
with that PM resistant stuff, you just
[SPEAKER_03]: found a new mechanism through which it
could be PM resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it doesn't have to all come
through the one sort of pathway,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever seen it in any of the
offspring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew a bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, um, the offspring are perfectly
like you get everything from the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, uh, for PM resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you get everything from your target,
uh, like plant to the male, like PM
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance, like from the female,
you know, baseline to like a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you get everything in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, at some point it'd be nice to,
uh, to be able to like follow that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, uh, a friend of ours,
uh, Dr. Philippe Henry, he does a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done a, uh, shit ton of papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got to check him, check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's done some really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he was, uh, he wanted to do,
uh, like a test, uh, like a study on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the whitey, um, using, uh, what's
called a snip chip or a snip chip and S S
[SPEAKER_00]: N P chip, a single nucleotide
polymorphisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he had, uh, like he has like,
uh, a snip, uh, S and P chip, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: template that he wants like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, I don't know, like I haven't followed
up on that, but basically the idea would
[SPEAKER_00]: be to, uh, throw it those F twos and,
um, like just do another similar situation
[SPEAKER_00]: where you just let the PM go all to hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you, um, take samples of
everything like stuff that's PM resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: and not PM resistant and everything in
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then try and drop all those onto,
onto one of those, uh, plates to get,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to see what the up-regulating
and down-regulating of all the genes is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like it personally, I don't
think, I think after you're going through
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this, I think the way that we
selected, like we found this PM resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is a perfectly viable way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like you can do all this stuff
molecularly and, and, um, but I think like
[SPEAKER_00]: doing stuff like, like, doing what we did
on the site is like superior, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: superior in many ways, because we're
dealing with the real, real world,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, fun, you know, fungal inoculants of
our environment that exists in our
[SPEAKER_00]: environment full time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like real, what do they call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like real evolutionary pressure,
so to speak, but that's a, that's a
[SPEAKER_03]: wormhole.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could probably go down forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've, we've actually just got one last
question before we do the quick five to
[SPEAKER_03]: wrap up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a listener who wanted to know if
you knew anything about the origins of
[SPEAKER_03]: Twixa, T-W-I-X-E-R.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, oh, is it got something to do
with butterscotch Hawaiian?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a butterscotch Hawaiian F1 phenyl
that we isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew it in, um, actually I was,
I was working with Gonzoise in Quebec at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time, Southern Quebec.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, we grew out some butterscotch
Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew out 250 of those F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, I was one of the top Venos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason it's called Twixer is because
Twixer is Canadian slang for 26 ounce
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of booze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was Venno number 26.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just thought it was like,
it kind of had a universal appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, like it's just a common in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a common phrase from back in the
day, like go grab a Twixer, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like pick up a Twixer, like a Twixer or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just like a thing that everyone
does, you know, go party, grab a Twixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how about, how about, uh, I give just
a little rundown on, on our like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, breeding slash Venno selection
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we didn't really, um, cover that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we kind of covered it here and
there, but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, like what we like to do is we like
to start off, um, let's say we're,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, we, we're growing something that we,
that's from outside of our, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: like seeds that we haven't made or grown
before, like something we bought and
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased or, uh, um, traded for or been
gifted, um, with, you know, we'll grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, depending on how many seeds we have,
like, if we have a limited amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we have three packs, for instance,
or four packs, we grow those out,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, take like cuttings of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and just, uh, like, like nowadays we
like to just hold onto the males,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and flower out all the females,
uh, smoke all the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like trying to classify them,
um, select out the ones we like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we'll do the, take the cuttings
of the males, flower them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I try and do like a good smell
evaluation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually what we like to do,
what we've been doing for the past few
[SPEAKER_00]: years is when we go to transplant those
male cuttings into, uh, to flower them
[SPEAKER_00]: out, we like to smell the roots,
the roots of the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do we smell the stems,
we smell the roots as well, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are, actually, if you get in there,
you'll smell, there's some, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some really like strong terpenes
that are coming off the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they might not be like perfect
representation, but, um, they just give
[SPEAKER_00]: you more information, um, like about the,
the smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, like with the Iraqi, when we grew
them out, um, we, uh, we did, when we went
[SPEAKER_00]: to put the females or the males into
flower, we had, uh, you know, we had,
[SPEAKER_00]: like 30 males or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so we just went through all the
males and smell, did like stem rubs and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and, um, root like smell, smell all
the roots and just chuck the bunch just
[SPEAKER_00]: cause basically just smell the ones that
are like a, the loudest ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's like the old timer wisdom is
just, you don't mess, don't mess around
[SPEAKER_00]: with males that don't, aren't loud as
fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the old timer wisdom,
but, and you know, we'll be a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll try and pair up males that,
um, are similar to the females that we
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and yeah, we'll flower out all
those, um, we'll collect pollen from the
[SPEAKER_00]: males that we want, and then we'll go take
that pollen, like, go get our,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, this is all like ideal, what we do in
ideal circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're not obviously not able to do
this all the time, but it's just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like the evolution of like how we're doing
things and how we like to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we'll, we, uh, we'll collect a
bunch of pollen and like we've,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, we have a, um, a vacuum pollen
collector that we hook up to a vacuum
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner that has like, uh, it's got like
two screens on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got, uh, it's just like,
uh, just some plumbing stuff, like
[SPEAKER_00]: plumbing unions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll make a post about it on Instagram
one day again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, it's got, uh, paper filter
disks to collect the pollen on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are like 25, we got like 25 micron
holes or something, but they'll collect
[SPEAKER_00]: all the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can like vacuum individual plants
and collect that pollen onto a paper disc
[SPEAKER_00]: and then take that disc and put it into,
uh, into like, uh, little Tupperware
[SPEAKER_00]: containers with some silica, uh,
desiccant beads, color changing silica
[SPEAKER_00]: desiccant beads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then just let the pollen dry out
for like a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can also see like if the
beads are changing color, then you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: change them out to get all that moisture
out of the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, um, take that pollen back,
like put it in, uh, like make some little
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuum seal bags and like vacuum seal that
stuff and, uh, like label it all,
[SPEAKER_00]: stick it in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and trying to like, before doing all
that vacuum seal, try and split it up into
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a bunch of different,
uh, like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mail number 17 will have like,
you know, like three little packets so
[SPEAKER_00]: that each time we open up the pollen,
there's enough to do a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination and we don't have to worry
about spoiling all the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to worry about opening up
like exposing all the pollen, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: to oxygen, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then yeah, make a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then grow out the seeds and do the
whole thing over again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long have you been able to store
pollen for successfully?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the free, in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think you have to like,
I want to, at some point I want to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, do kind of a figure out with a pretty
decent microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you desiccate the pollen,
I want to be able to look at it under a
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope and be able to tell when it's
like, look at it and see it shrinking
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that's kind of like,
um, be kind of interesting to see to try
[SPEAKER_00]: and optimize the curing of the pollen to
get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's doesn't overdrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't overdrive it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but like Skunkman says you can keep
on, you know, keep for 10 years or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if like, um, it's probably
0.01% vitality after, after 10 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you got a billion pollen grains,
yeah, you only need 0.01%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but in the free, like, uh,
it's only like six months to year in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you got to be really good about
making sure there's desiccant and with,
[SPEAKER_00]: and with your pollen in the fridge,
cause it's a moisture environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard people struggling with any more
than say six to 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do you go about doing your testing
of strains?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many seeds do you pop?
[SPEAKER_03]: What size pods do you grow them out in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a standard protocol or just sort
of whatever fits at the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, we try to grow at least one pack
for testing in-house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but ideally like two packs because
then it's just a little better sample
[SPEAKER_00]: size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then just, uh, just start them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, I just tend to start them in
little, like little cells and then just go
[SPEAKER_00]: through like a bottom to like number one
pot, number two pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then it all depends, like,
how much veg time we have till the next
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, like till the next room is
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can kind of variable, but minimum
we'll grow them for as four to six weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: before popping them in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is kind of what you want to do
anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get them, let them get
sexually mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then yeah, just generally
flowering them out in five gallons and up
[SPEAKER_00]: five or 10 gallons, usually in like your
pods.
[SPEAKER_00]: No organic mix with water.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, if we see, like we're
looking for the major things we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for when we do testing is number one is,
is this a plant worth growing or is this
[SPEAKER_00]: like a seed line worth growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there going to like, if people grow a
pack, are they going to find something
[SPEAKER_00]: worth growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least one plant that's like worth
keeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, the other thing is like,
is there like, if we grow, do we find more
[SPEAKER_00]: than one intersex plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: One intersex plant is, you know,
cause we deal with a lot of sativa stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is, um, I would consider it acceptable,
you know, if it's like one intersex out of
[SPEAKER_00]: two packs, maybe, you know, um,
but if we get more than that, then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, okay, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta, you know, it's like,
you know, it's too much, but generally we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't actually like, we don't see a lot of
intersex in most of our stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like surprisingly, it just kind of blows
my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our males, you know, our male,
like when we evaluate males, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things we do is we just like to keep the
male around in like beds for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep it in beds for like a year or
two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, um, you can see a lot, you can
learn a lot about the male just by keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: it around and, um, throwing it into
flower, you know, flowering them off
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just checking for like, uh,
cause even after a year, they'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: spitting out pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they'll be like, Ooh, they just like
start for some reason, they just get,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they'll get stressed out after a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we, you know, we like to evaluate a
plant that's due in clone form,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, more so than what they do in
seed form, because, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately most people are growing from
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not in most people, but a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely robust conditions there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Onto our final five questions for the
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess we'll maybe probably need to
get separate answers for each of these,
[SPEAKER_03]: but first one being what is the best or
most memorable cannabis smoke or
[SPEAKER_03]: experience you've ever had?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I was making brownies out of like,
I was maybe like, uh, 21 or 22.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was making some brownies out of some
sativa bud that, and I wasn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with sativa at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I had done LSD a few times before
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, I ate enough butter that I
was having a full LSD experience of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, memorable for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had, I actually had a similar experience
where I was making this one, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a bunch of, uh, weed granola and I
just, uh, I just, I got a little carried
[SPEAKER_00]: away, uh, eating it and I was thinking,
yeah, this is all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking, yeah, I wonder how much
of this stuff I can eat before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like what's the maximum
amount I can eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ate a bunch of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I was high for solid 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember like at one point I was just
like spinning out of control, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not, I mean, that's not like super
profound or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, what happens in when
you eat too much THC as a younger person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, um, as far as like, what was,
uh, Oh, memorable shit would be like
[SPEAKER_01]: Vancouver and like around the,
like around that 2000s area, like getting
[SPEAKER_01]: high down there with some of the people
that would come into town and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of really good memories.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a really special era in that
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was going on there at cannabis
culture with Greg Williams and Mark Emory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of really good memories of like
fighting, fighting for it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as like profound smoking,
he's thinking of like 420, it brings to
[SPEAKER_01]: mind, you know, just like being around a
lot of people and, uh, but what's,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like with, I think maybe the question
is what's the weed you smoke that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely interesting memories right
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we go to the other end of the
spectrum, what is the most disappointing
[SPEAKER_03]: experience in terms of something where
like your friends had hyped it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's really keen on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You tried it and you're like, is that it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this one time I grew, um, some Cali
orange that I got from Emory seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we, uh, I was just, this was when
I was new to the scene and, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just one of the strains I was going
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just thought it was the best shit
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause it was grown commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, anyways, so I grew some of this,
uh, Cali orange and, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: my grabbed a bud and, uh, my, my roommate
rolled some up and we like rolled up the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest fatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We smoked it and I looked at each other
like no effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what the hell is going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: But in retrospect, that was probably a
high CBD fennel like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's probably some, you know,
I had the same experience with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, uh, yeah, but maybe you're
thinking of like, what's the, what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of weed that was hyped up so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you went to smoke it and then
cookies is one for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you're like, Oh, this is all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're talking form.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Form kind of gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold the bass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're smoking it for a fact,
it's like that three day smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you smoke it more than three
days and it's no good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for the tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about, uh, these costs already is
already think of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd put it in a similar category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's got a really like super
pronounced flavor and like really strong
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a nice flavor comes out really
well in the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, the highest, uh, just not,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very like, uh, uh, like a
sophisticated, like interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say sophisticated,
but that's not the word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, yeah, it's kind of boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it just seems to like fairly easy
to build a tolerance to the East coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's nice to have like some other
weed when you have that stuff in my,
[SPEAKER_00]: like my experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next question we have is a fun one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to drop you off on a desert
Island for the rest of your life,
[SPEAKER_03]: where you can grow as much weed as you
want, but you can only take three strains
[SPEAKER_03]: with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can either be cuttings or seed lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're confident and you like now bring
on males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, what three things am I going to leave
you with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely got to be a Colombian in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely have to be a Colombian for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to have a tie and probably some
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian tie Afghan or Pakistani maybe
instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, like, like seed lines with a
bunch of variation and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like a nice Colombian with the
more, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like each bag would have like
10,000 seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so on the other end of the spectrum,
you're going to drop someone else off onto
[SPEAKER_03]: the Island, someone you're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: A fan of.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you, what are you going to leave
them with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, some lowrider for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking lowrider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something with a lot of intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, a lot of intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, it would be like a hemp
strain by the time you finally grew it
[SPEAKER_00]: out, you realize, Oh shit, this has got no
THC in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the heck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's like really sneaky intersex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like hidden right at the very bottom
leaf underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in the center of each bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Onto the final question for our interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had a time machine and you can go
back to any place, any point in history to
[SPEAKER_03]: presumably collect either some seeds or a
cutting, where would you go and what are
[SPEAKER_03]: you collecting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre Soviet invasion of Afghanistan all
through there in that hash making area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be super fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and maybe what about going back to
like, like a hundred million years and
[SPEAKER_00]: going, can we go to like a planet serious
to like serious piece or serious beast
[SPEAKER_00]: star?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd go to, we'll go to the like
the serious, like when they were loading
[SPEAKER_00]: the spaceships up with cannabis to send
to, to, to the earth, let's go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could like smoke all that
stuff and like pre select it before it
[SPEAKER_00]: went to earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's this all about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did cannabis was a gift from someone else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the, isn't that the normal
with normal set?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The princess of, of a serious being.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the cannabis it was a gift
from her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we go there, we go and hang out
with her.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, I think that just
about brings us to the end of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Were there any general comments or shout
outs you wanted to give or make?
[SPEAKER_00]: First shout outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we'll shout out the whole,
uh, like white Buffalo crew, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, ganja wise two or three grower,
two or three grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just, uh, just gotta look at our
followers list, I guess, to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: spellings, uh, X grower, uh, tree frog
medicine, Canada dang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Louie poncho.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: LD poncho.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly Canadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm sure there's a bunch of guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to miss anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are most of our main homies that we
collect with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was about to say, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone inevitably forgets one or two
people off the list.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not to, not to worry too much about
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, again, a huge thank you
for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both C Ray and scabby of white Buffalo
seeds for sharing all the knowledge,
[SPEAKER_03]: a bit of your plans for the future,
as well as some cool stories about some
[SPEAKER_03]: great cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, um, uh, if you want to check out
scabby's Instagram, it's a hop pop
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts XOP XOP extracts and a white
Buffalo seeds is with a Z at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: because I lost my, uh, I got, uh,
reported too many times with my original
[SPEAKER_00]: account.
[SPEAKER_01]: With an S at the end and the hope hope is
pronounced hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope was like an a W like a W H sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the X.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, the local word for hummingbird
around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's also like everyone
pronounces that differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people say hope, hope some say whoop
whoop, you know, some say Zopzop,
[SPEAKER_01]: some say Zopzop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like, Oh, that's universal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, again, thanks so much guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the interview was really
enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite, it was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's kind of nice to look back,
you know, like it's, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird looking back and realizing all
this shit, you know, like, like so much
[SPEAKER_00]: has happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it just seems like time flies and,
um, hopefully the future of cannabis is as
[SPEAKER_01]: big as we can imagine it, you know,
that's the only thing I hope you kids,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, grab those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get fucking grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be nice to, um, I'd like to hook up
with you for an update in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we got some cool shit coming up in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, uh, we got some like really
cool shit going on in, in hemp fiber and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, just like, uh, some growing some
sativas in the tropics and doing some like
[SPEAKER_00]: selections in the tropics and shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got guys testing our shit out in,
uh, like high.
[SPEAKER_00]: High desert, Southern California and like
Oklahoma and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's lots of cool shit coming
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it friends.
