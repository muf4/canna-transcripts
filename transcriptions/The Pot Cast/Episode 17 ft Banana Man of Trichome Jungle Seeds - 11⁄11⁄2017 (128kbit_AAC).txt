[SPEAKER_03]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
The Podcast, a cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_03]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: This episode, as always, was brought to
you by 420 Australia, your premier store
[SPEAKER_03]: for all things lifestyle and apparel,
as well as Team OGS, your one-stop shop
[SPEAKER_03]: for all things organic gardening.
[SPEAKER_03]: On this episode, we're really excited to
have Banana Man all the way from Spain to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about all things EU, as well as the
breeding scene and some history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay tuned for an awesome episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alrighty, a big thank you and welcome to
Banana Man of Trichome Jungle,
[SPEAKER_03]: our first guest from across the pond in
the EU.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for joining us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first question, as always, you probably
know what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your introduction to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, probably about 14, smoking with
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would have been some rock and hash mixed
with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sort of way that a lot of
people in the UK sort of smoked it at that
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that was the first experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't really get high from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably too much tobacco mixed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But probably two weeks, three weeks after
that, same group of friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got together and we smoked it in a
bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely got high anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't move off that couch for a
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't suppose you remember what strains
were going around back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it just just whatever?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, back in the days of hash,
there kind of wasn't really strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we had we had a lot of like import
like tie stick coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also like brick weed from Africa and
places like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first time I ever smoked the
African, like I got a high that was unlike
[SPEAKER_01]: anything I'd experienced from hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: The feeling in my legs, the tingling
feelings, almost like psychedelic to some
[SPEAKER_01]: extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that day, I just always asked the
guy, can you get more of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the stuff I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be smoking the hash
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I try to find more of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the time, there wasn't really any
skunk or anything like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like a few points in that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it goes without saying your
favorite land race is African.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because of the memories it brings
back, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the high that it has, it has something
special about the African wheat.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing which is really interesting
about the Africans is there's actually a
[SPEAKER_03]: fair bit of diversity within the African
land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, obviously Durban poison
just gets the main rap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it was Durban poison that you
smoked as a kid or something else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the thing which people often
mention about Durban poison is it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: all that potent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So based off your story, I would almost
tend to think it probably wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm going to say it was probably
something like a Malawi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting and you think it was like the
full on cob type thing or just some
[SPEAKER_03]: Malawi?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because of the color of it,
it had this like almost golden edge to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from looking into it a little bit more,
I'd say it could have been some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: Malawi cob type thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever toyed around with doing that
yourself with any modern stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're doing the cob method?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and a friend, a friend of mine grew out
of Malawi gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: He vegged it outside in the UK for most of
the season and brought it in to flower it
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end and flowered it for like almost
22 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just one plant growing under 400.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, again, the high off that was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we tried to make some cobs out of that
and bury them in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that was a fun experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's full on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so have you ever considered trying to
find that stuff and breed with it or is it
[SPEAKER_03]: just considered gone in your mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some Malawi seeds that a friend
collected while he was out in Malawi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm yet to start them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still in the collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope to pop them maybe one day soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we rewind back, what was your
first grow like?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what strains were you running
and what type of technology were you
[SPEAKER_03]: using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first strain would have been,
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how it came.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend was growing out the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd got a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd set it up in his room and we were
growing some Thai seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this time we hadn't really figured
out the whole 12-12 thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant was just growing and we sort
of scrapped the idea after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later on, I got some Hindu Kush seeds and
I found a book in an old little bookstore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this book said in it about the whole
12-12 light raising.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just like a light bulb moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got my plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the Hindu Kush seeds, planted them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And set up the light and away I went.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was basically just feeding it basic
stuff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I got some chicken poo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some wood ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I was basically feeding
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very basic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so just to fast forward for a quick
second, what's your grow style now?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, are you organic, coddled,
synthetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've pretty much grown everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a single way.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the last couple of years, I've been
doing a lot of cocoa growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using bottle feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also did a bit of hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this was more to do with like really
testing my plants and seeing what did well
[SPEAKER_01]: in certain situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a hydro, I could do a lot of tests
about removing certain nutrients and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing which plants drink more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which plants take up more nutrients,
stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I'm actually going back to my
original way of growing, which I'd always
[SPEAKER_01]: grown, which is organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But without the bottle feeds and making
more of my own ferments and teas and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like this, which I do outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm bringing my outdoor organic method
now indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got some pretty insane photos of
your strengths.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strains, not necessarily all of them from
your garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, some really full on photos,
just towering colors, things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like when that level of
quantity is being produced from a single
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, it is at the detriment of other
qualities, like, you know, quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I've noticed in the past with a lot
of strains that are big yielding,
[SPEAKER_01]: they tend to lack quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously through selection and the
gene pools that we are using now,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can achieve both.
[SPEAKER_01]: But saying that, the plants that I prefer
the most are on the more medium side of
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the new, the jungle juice,
which I'm smoking today, that has both the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality and the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yields are like outstanding and people
just keep picking this over everything at
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you can get both, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we just go back now for a moment,
how was it that you decided to get into
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it like a eureka moment on your own?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it you thought you could improve on
what was already there or was it just a
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of an accident?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one was a bit of an accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a blueberry that had hermed and
pollinated some of the stuff in the room
[SPEAKER_01]: that me and a friend were growing,
which at the time was white widow,
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp star, bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had skunk number one, Mr. Nice,
hash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were growing a lot of hash plant at the
time as well and a lot of KC Brains
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few things got pollinated by the
blueberry and I started germinating the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I realized, like,
we're not getting any males and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: all feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I realized that we'd made,
like, feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably a few years later from
that point that I was growing a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Dutch seed companies out and just
found them being quite lacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I thought, right,
I think I can actually make something a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit better than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I already had a plant that we call nap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was like a Hindu Kush type plant,
which was, like, super resinous,
[SPEAKER_01]: like knockout, sleepy type of high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the flavor was maybe lacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had this, like, aniseed, hash-y type
taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thought I can improve on that and
I crossed the Santa Maria Hayes male onto
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what later on went to make the
mantis, which is one of my, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: first main breeding project where I had a
goal at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, I mean, if we look at the mantis
for a quick moment, online, the genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: listed is nap crossed to Santa Maria
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it a Santa Maria Hayes hybrid or just
Santa Maria?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Santa Maria Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it in some hay hayes flower that I
was smoking in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found, like, five seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I spoke to the guy in the coffee shop
and he told me that he had a Santa Maria
[SPEAKER_01]: male that probably pollinated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took those seeds home thinking they
might be feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see if he's telling the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got two females and three males and
did the selection from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Mantis went on to do a few different
projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one I'm interested in is the Kali
Schnapel Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Kali Schnapel clone from Sonic.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also another one in the States
from Dynasty, just for everyone who knows,
[SPEAKER_03]: not talking about that one, talking about
the one from Sonic.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it about the Mantis OG hybrid?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you found the one you're after.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it about that that you were
thinking, this is going to pair really
[SPEAKER_03]: well with the Kali Schnapel?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mainly to add, I wanted to add the
little bit more of that OG sort of flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Kali Schnapel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the Kali Schnapel has an amazing
flavor, but I just wanted to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: something more to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's adding that male was the idea of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Kali Schnapel on its own is an
amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like super tropical sort of flavors that
come off it are amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fields are huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the biggest plants I've grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Full on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just looking back at a comment you made
before about getting those seeds from
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam, almost some parallels with the
Mr. Soul story from Brothers Grimm.
[SPEAKER_03]: What did the females turn out like from
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, you used the Mantis
males or females?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it the males?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I used a male from them onto the
female nap here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the females that came from those seeds,
one of them was like a haze, but with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more structure to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one had this sort of line
turp, which is what you get in the Mantis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so would you ever consider like F2ing
and just further line breeding it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it just more of like a breeding
tool?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done the Mantis now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken, I've made the F2 line,
which I did release, who Cannabis did a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice article on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a little bit of variation,
but so much less variation than I would
[SPEAKER_01]: expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I took it to F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made two batches of F3 and released
one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this year I'm going to take it to
F4.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you expect out of the F4?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I mean, given the F2s didn't show
all that much variation as one might
[SPEAKER_03]: expect, you'd similarly think the F4s
would be pretty limited in their variation
[SPEAKER_03]: as well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to do the F4s from a much
larger population as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to probably use like five
females and maybe two or three males,
[SPEAKER_01]: a selection of maybe 50 or 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that will be the F4s that I'll
finally release again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been talking to a few people about
this idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you then want to release those seeds
as labeled, like just, just a mixture from
[SPEAKER_03]: all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just, you know, it all just
comes from one batch or would you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: isolate individual females and be like,
you're buying a packet from this female?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a few breeders have done that
before, like a Dungeon Volt, he does that
[SPEAKER_03]: with a few different phenotypes of a few
different strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it'd be interesting if more
people got on board or do you just think
[SPEAKER_03]: for, in terms of like not bottlenecking
things, you just want to mix it all
[SPEAKER_03]: together and release it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for that reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't bottleneck the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would definitely use the five
females I would use would all be five
[SPEAKER_01]: females that all resemble each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still, I wouldn't want it to be too
varied.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing I go for with the mantis is
that the lime, the lime, like opal fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know opal fruits?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not familiar with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had like opal fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're called starburst now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you get the green ones and it just
reminds me of having them as a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the main thing I go for with the
mantis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we look at some of the other
lions you've lime breaded, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: say this wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the purisang or the persang?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the persang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a Sonic thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He selected that from seeds from Barney's
coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got them from Derry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember seeing it in the Canna
Bible, Jason King's Canna Bible when he
[SPEAKER_01]: mentions it in there, the persang haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think Sonic was the only guy who
actually kept those seeds going and bred
[SPEAKER_01]: that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he lime bred it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took it to F4 later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was mainly his work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, he uses a persang in a lot of
his crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've used that breed in male as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's a great male and great
plant to use as a super like, I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to compare it to amnesia,
but it has that similar to amnesia,
[SPEAKER_01]: but much more sativa and much more fruity,
almost like bubblegum fruity, like an old
[SPEAKER_01]: super silver haze or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to ask, what do you like about
it?
[SPEAKER_03]: But you just kind of banged it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something that's been kind of popped up
in a few of the answers is, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: this underlying theme of Dutch genetics
and, you know, things coming from Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel Holland influenced the
landscape of the UK breeding scene?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think like for me personally,
from the outside point of view,
[SPEAKER_03]: it seemed like for a while when Holland
first started to stagnate and say the
[SPEAKER_03]: early 2000s kind of felt like that rippled
a bit to the UK.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is when you've seen an
influx of more people actually selecting
[SPEAKER_01]: things and keeping more clones and
actually making their own seeds around
[SPEAKER_01]: this sort of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the one main strain that I think
played a big role in the UK is the UK
[SPEAKER_01]: cheese, which also came from Dutch seeds,
you know, skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's almost like synonymous in the
UK, like good weed is just called skunk in
[SPEAKER_03]: many places.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember at least when I was there in
2010, like hydro was called skunk,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, like good indoor quality
high quality weed was skunk and the other
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff was just import.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like there were some kind of
unsung heroes in terms of strains that did
[SPEAKER_03]: help build the scene?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've only recently become aware of it
through a few friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to Vic Firth, but Psychosis,
you know, that's from like the same,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Exodus crew, the same guys who did the
cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any other ones that you know of
that you feel like did really help build
[SPEAKER_03]: the scene, but maybe didn't get that
spotlight because cheese was like the
[SPEAKER_03]: poster charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a couple of strains that
there was about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one that we kept coming across
called I just it was just called I.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was almost along the same sort of like
fruity skunk lines that like typical Dutch
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk, but on that fruity side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that was one that stood out for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was later on that like the nap
that clone that I passed around to quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: few people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I suppose psychosis was always a
nice standout strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very similar in terms of with cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you were to put them both in the
same jar, I think you'd struggle to pick
[SPEAKER_01]: them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it all comes down to who grows it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think that plays a big role.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do you feel about the way
things are now in the UK where,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, at least for the masses,
Cali is king and seems like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: those import packs are like the be all end
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think this is a healthy culture or
it's maybe detracting from what's a really
[SPEAKER_03]: blooming scene at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the whole the Cali packs and stuff
like this, it's all gone a bit crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole the prices and stuff like that
I've heard of these things go for is just
[SPEAKER_01]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've not tried a lot of these sort of
like new Cali elites.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from what I hear from a lot of my
friends, again, it all depends on who's
[SPEAKER_01]: grown it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of these things that are
coming over to the UK are probably stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can't sell in a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_01]: That probably would fail a lot of tasks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certainly interesting the idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we jump low to clones, what do you feel
about clones?
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like, you know, with the advent
of clone ship as existing, the number of
[SPEAKER_03]: clones in different countries,
particularly the UK has just gone through
[SPEAKER_03]: the roof.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen people in the UK with clones
that I would almost swear would still be
[SPEAKER_03]: incredibly hard to get in the USA,
you know, like they seem so tightly held.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that a lot of the stuff that
is being flaunted around is real?
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost get the impression that maybe
people are just getting S1s or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, because like, for example,
if you say I've got sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're probably familiar with this
situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, is it the real sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like a lot of the stuff that's
coming in is the real deal or maybe people
[SPEAKER_03]: are just a bit optimistic or maybe getting
swindled or, you know, somewhere in the
[SPEAKER_03]: middle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there's a lot of clones of
each thing and people will find a bag seed
[SPEAKER_01]: and whatever they find in, that's what
they'll name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I imagine that a lot of these
clones aren't the original ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd agree to say that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you go about sourcing your
clones if there's something kind of in the
[SPEAKER_03]: US and maybe you're not really,
sorry, and maybe you know, without
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously talking about getting it to
Spain, like, do you find it's hard to
[SPEAKER_03]: source things or does Spainseeing got
plenty to offer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where does that stand for you as a
breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I tend to work with a lot more seeds
to be honest now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to work more with clones and elite
clones like the SFV, the Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just got the Bubba back from a
friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll definitely be working with that
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the rest of the US elite things,
I'm not too bothered about getting as the
[SPEAKER_01]: original clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I've got crosses where I know the
originals have been used.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like from Canarado and people like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I prefer to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of the problems come from
sharing clones, you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with America having a big problem with
like Russet Mites, PM, I'd rather not
[SPEAKER_01]: taking clones from places like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like you can almost stand
behind your work more when you're using
[SPEAKER_03]: both mother and father that you've found
from seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because then it is fully your
selection on both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can select our own elites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most people can even select elites
from packets of seeds of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a lot of it is hype.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I could select a plant and give it
to a certain person.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they hyped it the way they'd hyped over
strains, it would become just as popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I think that plays a big role.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find a lot of these elites that I've
spoken to friends, they say that some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them are not even that stand out compared
to other stuff that they've selected or
[SPEAKER_01]: tried for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting you bring that up because I've
kind of been having thoughts like that
[SPEAKER_03]: myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I pop a lot of seeds pretty regularly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I just commonly think to
myself like, geez, I'm finding a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: keepers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like I look at the numbers and it
seems pretty proportional.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's always made me think
like, is the bar low or what?
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How often is it you come across a plant
you've popped from a seed and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: thinking to yourself, wow, this is really
like, you know, a notch above what I would
[SPEAKER_03]: normally consider a good plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like, you know, like definitely
clone only possibly one of the best plants
[SPEAKER_03]: I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, how often does that happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite regular, to be honest, especially if
you're growing things from if the person
[SPEAKER_01]: sent you a packet of something like I
recently grew up the Bodhi soulmate.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sent me a few packets of different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like there was a little bit of
variation, but there's two females from
[SPEAKER_01]: the soulmate that could easily both be
elite strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smells of them, the growth on them is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm yet to try them both, but I know
that's going to come through on the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, both stand out plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see this a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just grown out some stuff from
Canorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing plants again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what I worked towards.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I want everybody else to
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow a packet of my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they find out of a 10 pack,
five plants that they're going to struggle
[SPEAKER_01]: to pick a keeper from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's always a good problem to have
when you've got to pick a keeper,
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Too many to choose from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is what everybody should be
getting from their seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have such a gene pool to pick to
choose from nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like it was like 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything that people agree to be
reading, people should be able to find
[SPEAKER_01]: keepers in every packet, especially if
people are putting the work in as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of just people releasing a lot
of F1s, but I would like to go down that
[SPEAKER_01]: line myself more just because I can get
through more strains in a shorter amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the line I'm going to
be going more towards because I like
[SPEAKER_01]: popping seeds all the time, making new
things all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, definitely go along those lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So interestingly, Mandarin is one of the
ones I knew from you before I'd ever done
[SPEAKER_03]: any serious kind of research.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I always do some good research
before every interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after I kind of looked into it a little
more seriously, quickly noticed one half
[SPEAKER_03]: of its age in orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing which kind of jumped to mind
at that is, is you probably haven't heard
[SPEAKER_03]: it, but we recently did an interview with
James Bean and he actually posed the,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the proposition that Tangi is
possibly just an age in orange offspring
[SPEAKER_03]: or S1 or maybe just a cut of it saying
that he had done some phylos testing and
[SPEAKER_03]: that was what it indicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Surely you've grown Tangi.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's big all around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see any similarities between the
age in orange you use for Mandarin and
[SPEAKER_03]: Tangis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you feel like there's maybe any
similarities between them?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some similarities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always said that Tangi was a NYC diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I always thought it was
because they have a NYC diesel clone that
[SPEAKER_01]: I found out recently that goes around in
Spain and they call this the Mandarinica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I found that, I was like,
that's like Tangi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that just reinforced the thoughts that
I sort of already had that Tangi was a NYC
[SPEAKER_01]: diesel, but it could easily be an age in
orange because I find these same when I've
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed the Mandarina with other things
like the Sour Diesel, I get those same
[SPEAKER_01]: turps coming out like the NYC diesel Tangi
type things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas Mandarina is a lot more sweeter,
fizzy sherbet type orange smells.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what's interesting to me is like you
made Mandarina a few years ago now.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, as far as I can tell from the
timeline, you made it just kind of before
[SPEAKER_03]: right when the whole hype around the
citrus terpene was just taking off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously Tangi was a big proponent of
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But did you have any idea that was going
to come about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, did you have a sense that this kind
of, you know, orangey Mandarin terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: profile was about to just take the scene
by storm?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or was it a bit of a fluke?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, seems like it came out at a perfect
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like we really enjoyed the age in
orange from Supercool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just a standout plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We passed that clone around to so many
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So working with that was just,
we were going to do it anyway because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was such a nice plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought the orange thing was fizzling
out, to be honest, because so many people
[SPEAKER_01]: were getting tired of that orange terp.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the new generation and how
things come around in circles,
[SPEAKER_01]: like with fashion and everything else,
things make a comeback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it was perfect timing
that they sort of, yeah, that came back as
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working the mandarina line.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was it about the, you know,
the male you used in that cross that was
[SPEAKER_03]: rights, the UK pineapples, some Shiva in
there, and even dynamite.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it about that, which you thought
just paired well with it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because essentially it seems like it's
imparted.
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you put it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of mellowed a bit of the sugariness,
at least the age in orange I'm familiar
[SPEAKER_03]: with, like a sweet orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like mandarina, you know, it's added
like a bit of sourness, taking a bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: sugariness.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think the male brought to the
table?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the pineapples Shiva male.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mainly was putting that onto the cheese
and the pineapples to do like almost like
[SPEAKER_01]: a pineapple back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also to cross it with the cheese
because of that skunkiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, I had a pot of gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also a nice like sweet skunky
apple sort of turp going on with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I crossed that with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was going for a skunky type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I was working.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I had the age in orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the crowberry, I had the bubba kush
and also the Jax cleaner clone from
[SPEAKER_01]: Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the time I thought, okay,
well I'll pollinate them at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were all just real experimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas that's why it sort of took a back
burner for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then after a few people trying it and
saying it was really nice, I thought,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, I'll definitely work that line in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I came to Spain, that's when I
started to finish the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was quite a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a big gap from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any other lines like that which
you've been working over, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: many years?
[SPEAKER_01]: The jungle kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that I've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the original cross was SFV,
the clone, the bubba kush clone and
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Hawaiian was added to add like a
little bit more vigor to those strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from those seeds, I worked that
line crossing them together and doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's what I released as the
actual jungle kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And later on, so the mantis, the mandarina
and the jungle kush are the three lines
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've worked really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is mainly F1 after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And was the first release of the jungle
kush labeled like F2, F3 or did you just
[SPEAKER_03]: call it jungle kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just jungle kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with the mandarina.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I worked the line in that,
it's because it's never sort of released.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the original ones just go between maybe
a few friends that are testing it and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what I actually released will be
the worked line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is what I released because that's
as close to the mother that most people
[SPEAKER_01]: have tried as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you consider kind of adding those
generations onto future packets just in
[SPEAKER_03]: the fact that these days it seems almost
standard that the more generations a line
[SPEAKER_03]: has put into it, you know, you can almost
charge a bit more for each generation
[SPEAKER_03]: because, you know, you have put work in
for each generation or would you still
[SPEAKER_03]: just always want to keep it, you know,
just simply jungle kush for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I definitely want to put like,
cause I haven't got a catalog or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: like that at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to put a catalog together and
maybe in there and put a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: of the history and the actual breed and
work of each strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be a good option just
because if nothing else potentially other
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders, you know, like they're always
looking for, you know, potentially more
[SPEAKER_03]: work stocks, more stable, more predictable
generally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, you know, hopefully you haven't
wasted your time working a line that was a
[SPEAKER_03]: dud.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, kind of a good indication if
you've bothered to work, it's probably
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you like the mandarina is so stable
for that smell that it has on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that you cross it with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people have even seen some small
little breeders around like Instagram and
[SPEAKER_01]: that they've used a mail of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reversed it and made a few lines for
karma and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and it's a very dominant trait now
because of how it's been bred.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've mentioned a few UK breeders and,
you know, I've mentioned one or two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you think it is that a lot of the
UK breeders don't get as much notoriety as
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the US breeders?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's the fact that just the
culture is a bit different or do you think
[SPEAKER_03]: there's not as many breeders per capita
type thing in the UK?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think the situation is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it definitely comes down to
location and the whole scene, the American
[SPEAKER_01]: scene is totally different to the UK
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the outdoor scene that they have
there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the selections that they've
been able to do even since the 60s and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like this in America, they have a
good genetic pool of plants though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so did people not really keep seeds
from those early import hash because it
[SPEAKER_03]: seems like that's kind of the most
valuable stuff going around at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think like even the old like hippie
types that I knew and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: like they never even kept an import hash,
even though they brought back all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: different things from India and places
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because we haven't got that outdoor
scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas people, when they came back from
their travels back to America,
[SPEAKER_01]: those seeds could be planted straight in
the ground and people could grow them out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do you think overall the ability to
have an outdoor season in general just
[SPEAKER_03]: really benefits the community,
like the scene, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even see it here in Spain visiting older
growers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have some strains that they've kept
for years and they're things that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: never even smelt before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the smells that come from these
old sativas and stuff that they've kept
[SPEAKER_01]: are very impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew a few out last year and some of the
turps, he had one that was an aphrodisiac
[SPEAKER_01]: gone across Thai and it smelt like
straight up chocolope from DNA genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: like straight up chocolope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was quite impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so definitely the outdoor scene
definitely improves those genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you just touched on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're now in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the Spanish scene like?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're our first person from the
Spanish region who's able to give us the
[SPEAKER_03]: rundown, which is obviously, in my
opinion, the kind of hot place to be in
[SPEAKER_03]: the EU right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you agree?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's it like from your perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think how it's portrayed on the
Internet is totally different to how it is
[SPEAKER_01]: in reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Catalonia now, some of the clubs are
starting to be recognized and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going down that line of sort of legality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how they're going to actually regulate
it and stuff like that, I really don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rest of Spain, no, you can't take
any cannabis on your personal self
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in your own house doing it,
you are permitted to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing it is a big gray area,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Barcelona is the place where it is
changing and going towards the right way,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you have a lot of clubs now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the Spaniard this every year,
which is a really big event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it's going in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is much more relaxed than the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: How the general public view it here as
well is a lot more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do you feel about Spanibus?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of people in the States
have mixed feelings about cups for a
[SPEAKER_03]: variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think like the Spanibus cups are
pretty good?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not really any whispers of
corruption or any people who are,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, not having any mishaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, I've seen none of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to be like the best flower or
the best extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: The extract does win.
[SPEAKER_01]: A group of friends of mine at the
boratree, Dabulous, which are like an
[SPEAKER_01]: extract company, they entered the sour
mandarina extract and they got a second
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely no, it can't be sort
of bought.
[SPEAKER_01]: How they judge it as well is quite fair in
the way they do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see the actual the actual
voting to show that afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like how they do that on the IC mag cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a very sort of transparent
cup, a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do you interact with all the
other breeders in Spain?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a few notable ones like
Charlie Garcia and the guys from Canna
[SPEAKER_03]: Biogen are the first ones to jump to mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a lot of interaction with
those guys or is it everyone's just kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of doing their own thing at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't tend to sort of get into the
whole scene out here too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm quite far from Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out in the sticks in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I'm not sort of, I don't get
involved in that side of things too much
[SPEAKER_01]: out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go to Spanobis, I meet up with some
of the breeders there and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a good event for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though they have a cup and stuff,
it's more about going and seeing old
[SPEAKER_01]: friends, new people, seeing what people
have, seeing how the bud has changed over
[SPEAKER_01]: the last few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just getting better and better and
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can only see it in the next two,
three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be some amazing stuff
available in all of these places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what's the coolest thing you've
ever seen at the cup in terms of Budwise?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few places that have some nice
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most like place that I actually like
to chill out is like, there's a place
[SPEAKER_01]: called Backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has a nice vibe about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always tend to have some nice stuff
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One place I haven't checked out yet,
but they tend to stock a lot of my things
[SPEAKER_01]: tonight is the plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems to have like a nice vibe about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I also see a price increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the bud can be cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the prices need to be brought down
definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that will happen as things go
more towards the legal side of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think that the development of a
scene is largely dependent on the number
[SPEAKER_03]: of people popping seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've got this theory that if
everyone stops popping seeds, essentially
[SPEAKER_03]: everything will come to a standstill in
terms of progression.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that's the case?
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because nothing new will be found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone grows the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone grows the same clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it happen in Holland where everyone
just wants to grow clones, even in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact that I'm in a seed market,
I think this is where most people in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe and the UK want to go down the
lines of feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think in the future, I think even
people are going to come away from that
[SPEAKER_01]: who are more serious about it and be
popping regular seeds and going through
[SPEAKER_01]: more regular seeds, doing their own
breeding, doing their own selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I love to see other people's work,
because everybody selects something
[SPEAKER_01]: totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give the same packet of seeds to
three different people and tell them to do
[SPEAKER_01]: some breeding work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they end up with will be three
totally different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we've mentioned a lot of breeders
so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who are some of the ones who you really
look up to or you're really fond of the
[SPEAKER_03]: work they do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bodhi at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very impressed with his work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always enjoyed talking to him and
seeing his stuff online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do a lot of good threads when he
used to do his trips to South America and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nepal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I admire Bodhi definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would there be anyone you'd want to do a
collaboration with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably like to do a couple more
things with Sonic, because in the past,
[SPEAKER_01]: me and him used to do a lot of work
together and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like the lines that he's worked
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, maybe some with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to do one with Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to kind of be devil's advocate,
what strain, if the proposed idea is
[SPEAKER_03]: you're each going to bring one side of the
strain to the table, which strain,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can even choose whether it's the
male or the female, what would you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: bring to the table?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, from both those people?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, on your part, if you were,
say, to do a cross with Bodhi,
[SPEAKER_03]: don't worry about him for the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you want to bring to the table
on your half?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can pick male or female, but one of
your strains, what would you most kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: want to stand behind, or what do you think
would work the best with one of his lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the jungle Kush or the mandarina.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just those two lines, just because of how
they breed and how strong they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those two.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've had this interesting theory for a
little bit now, basically, that a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time ago, I used to get pretty bad anxiety
with certain sativas, generally,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like the more stronger ones,
pretty typical with what most people would
[SPEAKER_03]: describe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as time went by, I kind of didn't
really get that anxiety anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a long time, I was thinking to myself,
oh, you know, like I've just had like a
[SPEAKER_03]: tolerance build up to sativas in general,
and I'm now able to have these more racy
[SPEAKER_03]: ones, because you know, like I've worked
my way up to a type thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then thinking back on it in general,
I was like, you know what, like,
[SPEAKER_03]: back when I was getting anxiety from the
sativas, I had anxiety in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nowadays, when I can smoke them,
I don't actually get anxiety anymore
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't in a very long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it makes me think, do you think
like a lot of that, even with weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example, is down to where you're at
personally, because like a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: will say, oh, you know, don't do a DMT
trip if, for example, you really you're
[SPEAKER_03]: depressed or you're anxious, because that
type of stuff can be aggravated and come
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that even applies to weed as
well?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it will go to the DMT one first
and say like, if you are feeling anxious
[SPEAKER_01]: or depressed, I wouldn't say not to take
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think to do it with the right person in
the right space is definitely more to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with it than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the mindset comes with it,
like the better mindset you in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you're going for an experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes it can help with different
mindsets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with cannabis, I would say,
yeah, like one of my friends, he gets a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit anxious with the sativas and still
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as he's got older, he's been able to
handle it a little bit better,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that answer your question,
I hope?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one I want to kind of think more
about myself, contemplate and see where we
[SPEAKER_03]: get to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a quick little question I wanted to
ask, where does the name Banana Man come
[SPEAKER_03]: from?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a funny one though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, I was the only one just
growing regular seeds all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All my friends were growing feminized
seeds and I was going to Dave Groves and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was just picking up bananas everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm thinking like it was a bit of a
joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like telling them I'm more of a banana
farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep coming here, just picking up
bananas all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I went online, I thought,
okay, banana farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I thought, no, actually banana
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the cartoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and that's how the name came
about really.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: What stuff are you testing out at the
moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my friends just done like a big like
grow of orange soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: So until testing out some of them and I've
just done a new jungle Kush times jungle
[SPEAKER_01]: Kush again, like a V2 version.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's given me a load of different
phenos of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a little bit of gorilla glue for
the clown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's given me a bit of that try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some jungle dog phenos, which was a star
dog crossed with the jungle Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they're limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only released so many.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's like a couple of packets
still available at other places,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I probably won't make that one again.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about the common hype
strains?
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned the gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people, you know, kind of hate on
the hype strains, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_03]: they love them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you sit?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I like a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's the GD4, it makes some real
nice hash and yeah, it's a good all round
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the ones that stood the test of time,
like the OGs and salaries and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The newer things like the cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like the cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tried like the gelato and a lot
of these new ones from like, and what else
[SPEAKER_01]: was there?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Sunset Sherbert, things like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm yet to try them.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you like to breed with the cookies?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's good for breeding and from
breeding with it, I see so many fanos that
[SPEAKER_01]: are so similar to like Bubba when I breed
with Bubba as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely like those cherry pie type
venos are popping up as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's quite interesting when you breed a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever the F1 Durban is, it's quite
interesting to find out what that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody actually knows,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's the case that no one
knows what the F1 Durban is or that maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just something completely different?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they probably found it in a bag
seed of something and they don't actually
[SPEAKER_01]: know what the parents is, just like so
many other things that have been found in
[SPEAKER_01]: bag seed and people don't really know what
the full parents is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do you feel about the idea of
breeding with S1s?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I've just done a cross with an S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm testing it out now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an S1 from a Fruity Pebble OG cross
with OG KB line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've just crossed that with my jungle
and I'm going to see how that comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my S1 of my Mandarina, I wasn't happy
enough to release them as a feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown other S1s out in the past of
like some chem strains and stuff like this
[SPEAKER_01]: and not really been impressed compared to
the actual clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do you feel about fem lines in
general?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it something we can expect from you in
the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm definitely going to be making
more fem lines in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made some Mandarina fem lines and also
some Sour Diesel fem lines last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've come out with some good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: The jungle juice and the orange soda was
made with my Jungle Kush with the Sour
[SPEAKER_01]: Diesel reverse and also with the Mandarina
with the Sour Diesel reverse to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: orange soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did it the other way around as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reversed the Mandarina onto the Sour
Diesel and I also did the Jungle Kush onto
[SPEAKER_01]: the Mandarina and the Mandarina onto the
Jungle Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've definitely seen that the dominant
plant is the plant that you reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all the ones that I've reversed with
the Sour Diesel have that slightly Sour
[SPEAKER_01]: Diesel stretch and have more Sour Diesel
taste with the Mandarina.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas when you reverse the Mandarina,
you get those more short Sativa phenos and
[SPEAKER_01]: more Mandarina taste coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same way around with the jungle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some quite interesting things
with like reversing and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even reversing, I've had a male that
produced pistols.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was somebody else's clone and I got
seeds from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I flowered it fully out, collected the
seeds from the male and grew those seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm getting 50-50 male and female from
them, which I didn't expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's been quite interesting as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you finished flowering them out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got 50-50 male and female from the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that was a couple of years ago that
one happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And were the females stable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the female was like a female from
that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So would you consider further using those
seeds or they just weren't that good in
[SPEAKER_03]: general?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they just weren't in the stash.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one thing I noticed is that you've used
C99 in a few of your strains and a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: these strains came out before Brothers
Grimm came back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you consider re-releasing some of
these strains with the new C99 or what's
[SPEAKER_03]: your plans for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because they're back now, I probably
won't work with that line anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time they weren't around,
the Cindy 99 was an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a line worked by a friend of mine
from Greed Bay and he worked the line for
[SPEAKER_01]: many years from the original Brothers
Grimm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will continue working that line
to F4 and I've just used a female that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've selected from those F4 seeds and
pollinated that with the Jungle Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've just named it Jungle Jane at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm testing them out at the moment to
see what they come out like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Cindy 99 is a real special plant and
that pineapple-y, fruity turplet it has is
[SPEAKER_01]: something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I wouldn't work with that now
that it's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be interesting to see what they make.
[SPEAKER_03]: So have you had a chance to try the new
one and has your F4s, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: has it varied over the generations
compared to what the original is
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, everything that you grow from the F4s
are just pure Cindy's.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just all coming out so similar and
there's not much variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was already almost like a stable
line to work with anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's quite easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend worked the line over years just
on height and then I worked it on those
[SPEAKER_01]: pineapple things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's come out amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where do you rank different attributes
in kind of your hierarchy of breeding?
[SPEAKER_03]: So in your mind, is it the case that you
don't care if it's big or small yield or
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's just a really good smoke,
like that's the goal?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you try to have a bit of a
compromise between commercial value or
[SPEAKER_03]: where do you sit on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you breeding entirely of head stash?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the go?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think one of the main things for me
is the vigor of the plant and how well it
[SPEAKER_01]: can handle light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it resistant to powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some of the main things for me
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is what most of the market
needs to start looking towards because of
[SPEAKER_01]: how things are going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, definitely that ranks quite high
for me and flavor is the main thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the high, that's down to different
lines that I work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each line that I work has a different high
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that comes with turps as well
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm finding that certain turps,
like the orange things for instance,
[SPEAKER_01]: the orangey things are on those lower THC
sides that people that extract it get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit less return.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that comes from those orangey sort of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you done any work with the whole,
how should I say, newly discovered land of
[SPEAKER_03]: turps in that people are adding food grade
turps back to concentrates and stuff now?
[SPEAKER_03]: The overwhelming feedback I've heard is
that it's not quite the same and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely not as good as if it was like
natural turps in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know much about this and how do you
feel about the turpsing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel it's like the new flavor of
the month thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think for the future, I think it's
going to hold a lot of benefits in the
[SPEAKER_01]: turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think breeding point of view as well,
certain turps are definitely stop mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain turps encourage mites to come to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the whole thing about adding other
plant turps to cannabis extract and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that, I don't agree with that to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think turps are quite a volatile sort of
solvent anyway to be smoking a lot of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think it's going to be
interesting what all this testing and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that brings to the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do you feel like the same testing
requirements that exist in the States
[SPEAKER_03]: should be, you know, in Spain as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like the whole how it's going legal in
the States and what they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: implement and stuff like that,
I don't know if I agree with all of it
[SPEAKER_01]: totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just opens up the market for big
companies basically like you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott's Milk or Grow that's bought out
Gavita and General Hydroponics and all
[SPEAKER_01]: these other companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not good companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the people that will end up
taking control, like Monsanto and Bayer
[SPEAKER_01]: have taken control of other parts of the
fruit and vegetable market and seed market
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you mix plant poisons into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to go in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be very controlled.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the constant trade scene like in
general in the UK?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in the States, it seems like
it's completely overtaken the flower scene
[SPEAKER_03]: for the, you know, the general consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like that's the progression
that's happening for the EU in general or
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe in the UK but not Spain or maybe
vice versa?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think is happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think like the extract scene is
becoming more popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be a younger generation thing
as well with the whole dabbing and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting into it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, yeah, I think in the future,
I think smoking will be looked at as like
[SPEAKER_01]: an old school way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the scene here in Spain, yeah,
dabbing is very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting more and more popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barcelona, yeah, there's a big scene for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots and lots of extract artists
now over in Spain and the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're bringing some beautiful
tasting stuff to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm competing with some of the
Americans even.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's interesting to see what
it'll bring.
[SPEAKER_03]: So would you ever consider breeding
specifically for turps or for
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrates?
[SPEAKER_03]: So to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I've sort of done that anyway
by breeding for trichome production and
[SPEAKER_01]: turps in general, like the jungle kush and
the jungle juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They produce some crazy returns.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, people are loving that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an extract artist dream,
those two plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think that comes hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: With breeding good flower, you breed good
extract strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're breeding for flavor,
I think that's one of the main things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trichome production, obviously,
you select for the plants with big
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome production that can produce lots
of turpines, the turpines that you choose
[SPEAKER_01]: that you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a question I was thinking about is,
how often do you think it's the case that
[SPEAKER_03]: someone grows out a pack of maybe yours,
maybe anyone's seeds, and they think to
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves, oh, this feed is not so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe they ditch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the truth is, maybe they just didn't
grow out that well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because recently, I've grown a few things
again that I initially thought were bunk,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're from people I really respect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give it another go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lo and behold, completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally worth keeping.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that's something which
happens a lot?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you mentioned earlier,
you're like, yeah, there's winners in
[SPEAKER_03]: every packet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think maybe there's a bit of that
going on for people who maybe disagree
[SPEAKER_03]: with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that just comes down to
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started breeding,
I seen this more with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants that I was selecting and using,
I would see this variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you were getting some really nice
plants and some plants not so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as that's progressed, I don't see that
so much in my lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even lines from other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown Bodhi's things this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown some stuff from Canorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown some stuff from South Fork
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their stuff does really well outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all amazing work from each one of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the interesting thing I just took away
from that is, all of those are US
[SPEAKER_03]: breeders, as well as many of the other
breeders you've mentioned so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think is the go with there not
being that many breeders in the EU scene,
[SPEAKER_03]: despite there being a really big market?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that more people from,
you know, UK for example, need to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, pick up their game and start
releasing things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or why do you think it is, you know,
there aren't that many EU breeders?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's lots of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot of shit companies out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, just producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what they're producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see some.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, yeah, like there's so many of
these little Spanish companies and Dutch
[SPEAKER_01]: companies popping up all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of Spanish people grow these
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like cheap, feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you see the results, everything's
just substandard weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, yeah, it's a shame to see
because if they were actually growing
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that were actually starting from
good seeds, they could produce some
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing flower out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics again, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these shit seed companies that use not
very good genetics that are just making
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds because that particular
plant produces a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good for making feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just polluting the market with
substandard genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something you may or may not have an
opinion on.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about the way strain
hunters, notably, you know, kind of went
[SPEAKER_03]: to other countries and just diluted or
polluted, I should say, the genetic gene
[SPEAKER_03]: pool, you know, with their stock in
exchange for land races, because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: almost kind of like what you're describing
in a way, like just coming and doing
[SPEAKER_03]: inferior stuff to the locals and they just
don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that whole thing was crazy
when I seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he's got a nice genetic library now
of all the nice land races and he's
[SPEAKER_01]: polluted it for anybody else to go back
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these people, like you tell these
people that you can get twice as much
[SPEAKER_01]: yield and you don't have to pick up mails.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these people are going to go with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how Monsanto has taken over parts
of Africa with certain things that they've
[SPEAKER_01]: produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just the same thing as that,
really, like going around to these places
[SPEAKER_01]: and polluting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not even like he's given a few
seeds to one little farmer and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep that little patch or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's literally gone there with kilos of
seeds and taking kilos of their seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all crazy, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the immediate thing I thought of,
it's almost like a crude way of like
[SPEAKER_03]: copywriting it, you know, because as you
said, it's like you've got your library,
[SPEAKER_03]: no one else's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what he'll be doing in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, yeah, he's looking to the future
where he can patent certain strains or
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see what
Arian's game plan is now that the main
[SPEAKER_03]: workhorse there is no longer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Franco was a good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had the true passion for the plant now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, shame he's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: With you, Franco, in my opinion,
did all the work and it was so pretentious
[SPEAKER_03]: the way Arian named everything after
himself when he almost openly admitted he
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't do any of the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a shame to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, hopefully some good new Dutch
companies can take their place.
[SPEAKER_03]: An interesting idea I wanted to ask you
about, though, is do you think that people
[SPEAKER_03]: who are aspiring breeders throughout the
EU should move to Spain, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: to help get things going?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the underlying idea is,
is it better to try to have one more
[SPEAKER_03]: person, you know, like doing the right
thing, being a good breeder, but in Spain,
[SPEAKER_03]: or to stay in the illegal country,
kind of, you know, fight the hard fight,
[SPEAKER_03]: but not be able to reach your full
potential and, you know, offer what you
[SPEAKER_03]: could maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think even in Spain, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't achieve my full potential out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I'm looking towards maybe
working with somebody in America to sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of get a lot more of my genetic lines over
there, maybe work some of the lines on a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger scale, larger selections,
because that can't be done here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still a very big gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think anyone who's thinking about coming
to Spain should definitely look at all the
[SPEAKER_01]: laws, come out here first, speak to people
that are already living here, and judge it
[SPEAKER_01]: for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think it's possible for the
average person to make a living?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like let's, let's, let's be actually
really optimistic about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say you live in America and so,
and you're a really good grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you've got validation of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, dispensaries will pay top
dollar for your type stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're thinking to yourself,
yeah, if I move to Spain, I could
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely grow stuff through a good sell
to dispensaries, you know, yada,
[SPEAKER_03]: yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that that's actually
possible?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think like, no, like you,
you know, you're not going to get enough
[SPEAKER_03]: money for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have other stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like how do you see it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm not really in that scene in
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how that would work there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how it really works there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with it going sort of more legal and
they're going to sort of regulate the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms and that maybe, I think maybe,
maybe they might even go towards that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never think that's going to be
interesting to see over the next year or
[SPEAKER_01]: so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we were going to talk about some of the
traits that you look at in males and think
[SPEAKER_03]: that that indicates a superior male,
what are the, some of the things you like
[SPEAKER_03]: on males that you think indicate,
you know, this is going to be my breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resistance, you know, how, how well it
copes with things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, um, the growth, um,
I like to tend to go for like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a slightly shorter type male because
when they do go into flower, they tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch out a lot more, um, short inter
nodes between the spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the smell of the stem was something
that I always used to go by and when it
[SPEAKER_01]: dropped pollen as well, not those males
that dropped too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and obviously, uh, resin, like the,
the males that you can get resin from and
[SPEAKER_01]: smell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they are the special males.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you find that that flavor or that
smell correlates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to actually start reversing some
of my males and turning them female to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually see, uh, how they end up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that I'd like to,
I haven't done that I'd like to start
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as a bit of a random side question,
would you ever consider doing a pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: release?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, do you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually, uh, um, got some pots here
at the moment and I was thinking of doing
[SPEAKER_01]: a little giveaway of just, uh,
free, uh, free packs of seeds and one
[SPEAKER_01]: little tube of pollen to someone,
someone that's already grown out my
[SPEAKER_01]: strains as a little giveaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I definitely look towards doing
something like that in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what would be some of the strains
you'd want to do for the pollen release?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because obviously as a breeder,
you could do it strategically because you
[SPEAKER_03]: can think, all right, what is something I
would want to get out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know, best case scenario,
someone breeds with it, make something
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, whenever something amazing
is around, people always look at the
[SPEAKER_03]: parents and think, Hmm, you know,
I'd like to try that type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, it would be the mandarina and,
uh, the mantis, uh, because of the two
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of turps that it does pass over,
it's quite a dominant, both of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: quite dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, mantis passes over this lime zest and
the mandarina passes over that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that orangey citrus turp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would be the two pollens that I
would actually, uh, probably look towards
[SPEAKER_01]: giving out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we just jump back to what we
were talking about before with the
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding, an idea commonly brought up,
and I think notably I've heard this from
[SPEAKER_03]: Subcool is he says that he believes the
males particularly bring the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you find that is an accurate rule of
thumb or it really just varies?
[SPEAKER_01]: The male brings flavor, let me think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess if you wanted me to like
elaborate a little bit more, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: your selection of the male, that's what
brings the flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, you could have a female
and she's really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got really good flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if the male you pick, if, if what his
profile is, is not good, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going to dominate more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so do you feel like the male you're
using crosses dominates them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that plays a big role.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're, if you're selecting a male,
um, the outcome from that cross can be
[SPEAKER_01]: varied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where you get some plants that
are amazing and other plants that you just
[SPEAKER_01]: look at and think, Oh, I just wouldn't
even snipe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that plays a big role.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what about this idea I've been thinking
about, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the best female for breeding a dominant
one?
[SPEAKER_03]: In that a lot of people, I feel,
buy seeds more so for the mother than the
[SPEAKER_03]: father, because there's a lot of people
out there, notably say Subcool,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, who, a lot of the strains use the same
father again and again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's like the people buying these
seeds obviously interested in the mother,
[SPEAKER_03]: what it brings to the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that being said, is the best
mother, not one that's very dominant so
[SPEAKER_03]: that people can ideally find a good
replica of it in the 10 pack?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even males that are non-dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you cross a male, everything that
comes is more like the mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find some males are like this,
like a non-dominant male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't matter what you cross that
male to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of the phenomes are coming out
like the mother that you cross it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that plays a big role as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes down to selection again,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do you find you select that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you just have to do it the old
fashioned way and, you know, make some
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds grow them out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Test them and test.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time, time consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you use multiple males on the same
female, all at different, on different
[SPEAKER_01]: females though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't mix the pollen and then test
those seeds out and see which males pass
[SPEAKER_01]: over what traits, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only way it can be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how many seeds do you like to pop when
you're popping one of your strains to get
[SPEAKER_03]: a bit of an idea of, you know,
if it's a good line, if it's worth
[SPEAKER_03]: releasing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pop a couple of packets myself and
I'll give out a few packets to friends
[SPEAKER_01]: that will grow them straight away and then
give out a few to maybe a few selected
[SPEAKER_01]: people from online or something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then see the results from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I tend to do it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just with this new one, I've done so many
new crosses with the jungle kush that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: just started so many seeds outside and
they've vegged up for a few weeks and
[SPEAKER_01]: they've gone into flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all very short, but I'll get a
good idea of which ones I want to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: working with or test more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like from each strain, I want to be
seeing like from 50, I can get a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage from 50 females.
[SPEAKER_03]: And would you ever consider providing a
little bit more kind of detailed
[SPEAKER_03]: information on number of phenotypes,
what you could expect from each phenotype,
[SPEAKER_03]: that type of thing, because we have seen
more breeders switch over to providing,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, these more kind of thorough
analysis, particularly on F1s where it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, there is a bit more variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you go on Breed Bay, we used to
have to fill out a form and then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: see it all there and it says how many
phenomes of each type and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used to do this a lot more,
but I see that so many people are just
[SPEAKER_01]: like not even interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to know what the mother is
and what the father is and what it's
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all about the name, it seems
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always tend to jot all these things
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got notebooks and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe I'll put that in the catalog as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go on Breed Bay, a lot of my
older strains and the mantis and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, you can actually see and it
says there, you know, the parents,
[SPEAKER_01]: how many phenomes of each type and
explains everything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something I've noticed over the past
kind of year or so that I've been doing
[SPEAKER_03]: the show is I've been keeping tight tracks
on which seed base is stocking who and
[SPEAKER_03]: things like that for various reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And something I've noticed is your seeds
have been increasingly getting to more
[SPEAKER_03]: seed banks, getting out there more and
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you found that's been like an easy
thing or it's been a bit of an uphill
[SPEAKER_03]: battle?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what should people expect if they're
looking to get their seeds out there into
[SPEAKER_03]: the market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's hard, hard to sort of maybe
crack America a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I've had quite a few people
buying from America and Canada since I
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of started on Breed Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a lot of American people on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, Subcool was on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bodie was on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gooey Breeder, Sun Simulator, quite a few
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a good little community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people came there,
bought seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had quite an American based market
for a while, but it all comes with time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think now that it seems all about
cups and what you've crossed it with,
[SPEAKER_01]: that seems to be how you sell seeds now
more than how much work's actually gone
[SPEAKER_01]: behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's more for the connoisseur
type grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with that being said, do you not
feel like it's really important for you to
[SPEAKER_03]: try to win as many cups as possible?
[SPEAKER_03]: Assuming they are based on merit,
because, you know, it is going to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: flow and effect of sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd like to enter the ICMA Cup
again, just because of how transparent it
[SPEAKER_01]: is and you get to see everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't really into cups in the past,
but recently I've entered a few and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: got a few cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's been good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think it's always good to
enter one every now and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe in the future, I'll probably
stay away from most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just stick with the ICMA ones or maybe any
new ones that pop up, which are a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So overall, what would be your advice to a
new aspiring breeder?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the best way for them to get into
the market?
[SPEAKER_03]: Should they look to develop a library
first?
[SPEAKER_03]: What should they do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Before they try to start getting their
work out there to the masses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow as many different genetics as you
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Create a library.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pass them to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give out so many seeds for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've given out so many seeds for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give out your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the seeds will speak for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at what point did you make the jump
from just making some seeds for yourself
[SPEAKER_03]: to thinking, you know what, I'm going to
sell this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was making a few different strains,
making a few different crosses and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people would show an interest asking,
well, when are you going to put them on
[SPEAKER_01]: breed bait?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sent out a lot, and people were
putting up pictures and growing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was around 2007, 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's when I sort of created
Trichum jungle seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it went from there really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's only more recently that I've had
a bit more of an influx of interest and
[SPEAKER_01]: sales and stuff like that is from the
whole American market, I would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, of how it's going over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what do you think is going to be
the next big thing to hit the American
[SPEAKER_03]: market?
[SPEAKER_03]: And are you already working on something
for that, catered to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm working on a few things at the
moment, and mainly the jungle kush
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've crossed so many different things
with jungle kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the main ones are going to be like
the Tahoe TK crossed with the jungle kush,
[SPEAKER_01]: the SFV TK with the jungle kush,
the Girl Scout Cookie crossed with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Cherry Pie crossed with the jungle kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are in testing at the moment, which I
think are going to be like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, the parents I've selected are
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see how the testing goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to be the main ones that
I'm going to be releasing soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I released two recently, which were the
Hadouken, which is the Sunset Sherbert
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed with the Cookie Crisp from
Canorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I crossed that with the jungle kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Jungle Rose, which is a cross from
Motive 303 of Fruity Pebble OG with UW.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found this Feno that has this rose
water turp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the one that I selected and
crossed with the jungle kush as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and everything's coming out
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've just finished testing that and
just done a release.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm both of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crystal Ship is a strain that caught my
eye because it uses Kodiak Gold,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is not a well-known strain from
Reaper Man.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, would you consider using it
again?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it one of those ones that's kind of
long gone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I used it at the time and it was a
nice selection, but now from the Jean Paul
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've got, it's not a standout plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus I probably wouldn't want to work with
a Reaper Man stuff anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: It do go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like some of his views he's had in
the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people change and that,
but yeah, I'll probably stay away from his
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics from now on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we then jump a generation
forward, Galactic Smurf, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you use Crystal Ship.
[SPEAKER_03]: You crossed it to Unknown Strains Ponyboy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always love Unknown Strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell us about this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the go with him?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, Ponyboy.
[SPEAKER_01]: These seeds came to me at High Times Cup
one year from Coyote Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was some like mad American guy
and he had like this picture of all like
[SPEAKER_01]: little smurfs everywhere and like he'd put
them all in his bird and some seeds and he
[SPEAKER_01]: had all these different crosses with the
smurfs and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I got those seeds from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't find any information about
this guy at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've ever heard of
Coyote Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that's that's where it came from.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okeydokey.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we mentioned the Jungle Kush a few
times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that this is kind of going to
be your masterpiece, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you envision envision there ever
being a masterpiece?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think you'll just continue on
with strains and just keep working things
[SPEAKER_03]: until you find a new thing to work on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like every year I'm finding just new
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it's unbelievable how many
different smells that this plant can
[SPEAKER_01]: produce like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every couple of years I'm finding
something that stands out that I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never smelled anything like this
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think I think creating,
we're always creating, we're always
[SPEAKER_01]: learning throughout life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I think that's how I'll take my
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Constantly learning from this plant and
constantly creating new things all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Jungle Kush at the moment amongst
everybody that's growing it and extracting
[SPEAKER_01]: from it is one of the standout strains
alongside the Jungle Juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Jungle Juice will probably become
almost elite like because there's not many
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds of that left now in circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't got the Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a RezDog Sour Diesel,
but Karma selected it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I reversed that to make that and also
the Orange Soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't got that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how I work that line further in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's interesting you mentioned Karma.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you've used some of Karma's
strains in a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_03]: strains of your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any other breeders out there
besides the ones already mentioned?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Canorado got a bunch of big ups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any other breeders who you would
consider using their work?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, Karma stuff, I like these OG lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Kush, Biker Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a real nice plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even liked his Headbanger.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But me and him don't work too much
together anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: He used my Mandarina on a few crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made a few Mandarina crosses for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, working with other breeders in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some Colabs or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some limited things that have been
quite interesting with some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll see how things go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so just to clarify, things went sour
because he made the Mandarina Kushes or
[SPEAKER_03]: you made them for him?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what that was?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody else actually made them,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave someone a Mandarina clone and they
just pollinated a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he ended up with some seeds from some
guy that he was using to make some seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where they came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he's used the same name,
put the same name on it and released them
[SPEAKER_01]: as freebies now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably down to the things going
sour between me and him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens a lot in this game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of breeders, they fall out of
certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's how things go sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how do you feel about the idea of
asking for permission to use someone's
[SPEAKER_03]: work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it mandatory or just respectful?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think it's respectful to ask
someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends what your intentions are with
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to be making a lot of
money from it and that, then yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people need to be asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to be doing a limited drop
or giving them out for freebies or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like this, I don't see it as too
much of a big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are welcome to use anything from
any of my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say always select the male, select the
female, make things, cross things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how we all start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I don't have a problem with it
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few people have used my things and not
asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really bother me, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we jump back to that African
land race idea for a while, will we be
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing any African crosses in the future?
[SPEAKER_03]: Notably, I see you have the Caribbean
crush, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, not Africa most people are thinking
of, but nevertheless, an Africans train.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, that was a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and Sonic went to St. Lucia,
I'm trying to remember when it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably about 2009 or something like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went to a field there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The variation was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had like 12 foot sativas and you had
like tiny little two foot plants next to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like because of the season there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went round, we collected some
flowers or the things that smell the
[SPEAKER_01]: nicest, took them back, dried them,
tasted them, selected some seeds from
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them hermed when grown indoors
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of them hermed when grown
indoors and delights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then out in Spain, I found a nice one
and I pollinated that with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the mantis and I had St. Lucia and I
pollinated them both with the headbanger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made like the sour mantis and the
Caribbean crush at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but that was a real nice train as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it had that almost tropical,
but zesty going on with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it was a nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We selected from that field.
[SPEAKER_03]: An idea I've had for a little bit now is
do you think that the most memorable
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses are ones that produce really
unexpected, but awesome flavors?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for example, if you crossed a
chocolate strain with a strawberry strain
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're thinking, Oh, I'll get like,
you know, chocolate stories or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it comes out and it's like rotten
meat and like maybe it's like phenomenal,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like something like that,
which is like, you know, totally doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really add up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like those are often the most
memorable ones or sometimes the
[SPEAKER_03]: predictable ones are the best as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I think the ones that really
like, for me, when I grow things and
[SPEAKER_01]: someone says it's a cross of this and
this, and then I grow it and it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it produces a smell that's nothing like
any of the parents and really unique and
[SPEAKER_01]: unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: That for me is something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've come across that couple of times
this year with a few things and they've
[SPEAKER_01]: become part of the library.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people will see a lot more from those
things and a little history on each one
[SPEAKER_01]: soon in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so just as a bit of a random question,
how important do you rate aesthetics
[SPEAKER_03]: within your whole breeding operation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you value it highly?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you ever knock a strain back from
market if you thought, Oh, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really look good, but it was like really
good smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I'd sort of explain it a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you get some varied phenos and some
of the small yielding and some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: large yielding or maybe like you get some
like with like even I'd consider some
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie crosses like they have these like
almost freaky and stunted almost phenos
[SPEAKER_01]: where the buds don't want to grow too big
and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'd explain all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so just as another bit of a random
question, if you were going to enter a
[SPEAKER_03]: crop, would you want to enter something
which you thought was just really
[SPEAKER_03]: well-grown or like, would you also want to
have like a bit of that real wild card
[SPEAKER_03]: factor of like throwing some real unique
flavor or terpene profile out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be your kind of aim?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time I'd like to enter a
strain that I've got in seed form and a
[SPEAKER_01]: pheno that represents the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it does win, people can have to see
it and a good representation of what I've
[SPEAKER_01]: actually won.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good thing to go for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do you have any kind of old school
genetics or any kind of wild cards that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're looking to breed within the near
future or, you know, pop in the near
[SPEAKER_03]: future potentially work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely a few of the Landrace
collection is definitely going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some Hunza, Pakistani strains,
Uzbeki, some African strains again,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm interested in popping some of them
because I haven't grown any of that for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think more of the Landrace because
I've been starting a lot of seeds from
[SPEAKER_01]: other breeders, a lot of my own stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's time to do a little Landrace
selection and see what comes about.
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you want to work that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say you did pop it and you got
some good numbers of, let's just say just
[SPEAKER_03]: one, would you want to cross it with a
certain strain or would you want to breed
[SPEAKER_03]: it a few generations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've got already got like Brazilian
and Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd probably look for something in the
Uzbeki strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the Citral strain or even the Hunza and
find something a little bit more on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica side and cross that with the
Mexican Thai.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what type of like, you know,
let's say you do have this crazy hybrid,
[SPEAKER_03]: what type of work would you want to do
with it then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you want to keep working it to the
point where it's stable or be offering
[SPEAKER_03]: something that like, you know,
it's a bit more wild kind of like what
[SPEAKER_03]: Bodhi is doing now, what's kind of the end
goal for the Landraces?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be nice to create something totally
from scratch, from the originals and then
[SPEAKER_01]: work that line, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even work it outside would be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each year maybe do a little patch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that'd be quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's just say worst case scenario,
you got the seeds to pop but they were all
[SPEAKER_03]: showing herm traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you try to line breed it and weed
them out or would that type of thing just
[SPEAKER_03]: indicate too much effort for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I try and work away from that and
especially outdoors, I'd expect not to see
[SPEAKER_01]: it as much with a lot of these strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's de-prone to it and it's
natural but I try and work away from that,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can breed it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many generations would you expect it
might take?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I mean, something I noticed is in
the earliest SSC magazines, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: they would often say bred for four
generations, shows some hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_03]: traits still.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was something, you know,
the best stock there was.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, it makes me think, well,
obviously it's not worth just throwing in
[SPEAKER_03]: the towel immediately, but it might take a
few generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, four sounded like they maybe
got lucky, like I would almost expect it
[SPEAKER_03]: to have taken more to really taking a good
step away from those traits, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're recessive if like they're
all herming on the first generation,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say you could do it in four
or five generations, I reckon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on what you're starting with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I guess if we jump back to strain
hunters for a moment, do you think there
[SPEAKER_03]: is any real pure land races left or
they've just all been diluted in one form
[SPEAKER_03]: or another?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of places have been diluted
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other small islands and maybe hard to get
to places have still got things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it's only one or two packets
that have been brought to these places and
[SPEAKER_01]: then introduced, natural selection,
again, we'll get rid of them and they all
[SPEAKER_01]: revert back to their sort of almost
natural sort of stuff anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there are still some places out
there with some land race strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: What places would you like to go and
search for some land races?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe some Indian genetics would
be nice to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think India would be maybe a nice
place to go and collect some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that just because you're into hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the whole hash thing,
the culture, yeah, it'd be interesting to
[SPEAKER_01]: see it all and collect some seeds from
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next on the list after that would probably
be South America.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to see some of the stuff there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about strains that throw
nannas at like the end of the cycle?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the ones that do it rather
predictively.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like that's a negative trait
or it's just kind of like something you
[SPEAKER_03]: deal with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't see it as a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that sometimes I see it from the
ancient orange before, but they were
[SPEAKER_01]: always unfertilised.
[SPEAKER_01]: And never ever made seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could even pick them out and try and
make a seed from them and they just
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's almost like a natural defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've pushed a plant out and you get a
few nannas at the top and that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see it as a huge problem.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another one I wanted to run by you is I
myself have seen a bunch of plants be
[SPEAKER_03]: re-veged before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I say re-veged, I mean they've
been taken more or less full flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just trying to re-vege from that
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like when you do that,
often it's kind of detrimental to the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant in that the plants may be not quite
the same as when it was first flowered
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like, do you tend to lose any
traits from re-veging or do you find
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not the case?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that depends on the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen things where me or a friend
who's veged stuff out, re-veged and taken
[SPEAKER_01]: clones again, grown those plants out and
they've been identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think genetic drift in general can
happen down to genetics and the health of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can re-vege that plant and get
it healthy, nice clones coming off of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I think you'll get good results back
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you agree with the idea expressed by
many of our guests in that a poor clone
[SPEAKER_03]: room in terms of the quality results in a
degradation of quality over time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're taking clones off poor mothers,
then I've seen it with the cheese clone in
[SPEAKER_01]: the UK and people taking clones off it,
clones off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they start taking clones off poor
mothers, I start seeing the outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the plants don't bubble up like they
normally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't fill out like they normally do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the buds are a little bit smaller,
even down to like taste and smell can be
[SPEAKER_01]: lacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can happen over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping your mothers healthy is key,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you mentioned earlier that you're
organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're really into that now.
[SPEAKER_03]: What type of growing style do you use
specifically?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you feeding your plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you feeding your mothers to keep
them healthy?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you giving them in all regards?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I was doing it mainly with cocoa
and bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I'm back to organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using a lot of slow release powdered
organic sort of amendments, making like
[SPEAKER_01]: some ferments, aloe vera, I use that a
lot, and coconut water, bean ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can get nettles, that depends on the
time of year, make some nettle tea,
[SPEAKER_01]: comfrey tea, stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, going along those lines now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoors, I've always done it organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And always indoors, I've always done
organic until I come out to Spain really.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's only been the last couple of years
I did the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also a good way to test plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just quickly touch on the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you enjoying the outdoors more?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, given you're into your hash,
I imagine you would.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something I've always seemed to
notice.
[SPEAKER_03]: People say that the outdoor hash is
unbeatable because even though,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, maybe the bud doesn't look quite
as good as indoor because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a bit of dirt, a bit of wind and
all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That, you know, the trichome heads are
still perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the sun spectrum is number
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you feel about it all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where does outdoors sit for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the sun, like that weed,
is by far the best that you can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun produces like terpings that you
just don't get when you do it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think indoors, organic, you can achieve
similar outcomes, but still not like the
[SPEAKER_01]: sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think chemical fertilizers or like
mineral salts or whatever they can produce
[SPEAKER_01]: like maybe a little bit stronger weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the terps, outdoor, under the sun,
is the way forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been getting into a couple of books
from Jeff Lowenfels and what's the other
[SPEAKER_01]: guy called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something Lewis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're like the teaming with
microbes, teaming with fungi, teaming with
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been really good books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting into practice a lot of knowledge
I've gained over the years through like
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of growing like a permaculture type
garden, vegetables in that sort of style,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of companion planting anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to put all this into practice
now with cannabis outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the garden outdoors this year is just
looking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so that's something you mentioned to
me earlier, that you do grow a lot of food
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you even said you keep some
bees, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: How does all that play into things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that people do grow
organically, should try to make an effort
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow their own food and things like
that, seeing as they've got the skills and
[SPEAKER_03]: often a lot of the inputs as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like bees, I used to keep bees when
I was living in the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I've moved to Spain, I've stopped
keeping bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: But growing food, I think everybody should
grow their own food.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it comes down to is where you live
and land.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't have the land,
a lot of people don't have the time to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have the time and you've got
the land there, definitely grow some food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the skills, so put it into
practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people grow organic, but then
they don't eat organic food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going along those lines as well,
when you're growing your own food,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know everything that's gone into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like you do have a better view
on the whole plant now that you do do it
[SPEAKER_03]: organically?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess what I'm trying to say is a lot of
people say to me when they grow
[SPEAKER_03]: organically, they feel kind of more in
tune with their plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not necessarily like this weird hokey
pokey spiritual way, but in a sense of
[SPEAKER_03]: like they really understand the soul.
[SPEAKER_03]: They understand how it's all working,
whereas the stuff in bottles can still be
[SPEAKER_03]: a bit smoke and mirrors at times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel like you have that better link
with your plants in either way,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it be spiritual or just a more
fundamental understanding of the cogs and
[SPEAKER_03]: wheels?
[SPEAKER_01]: Organically, it teaches you everything
about how that soil works, how that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: works.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're actually making all these
things yourself, this is what so many
[SPEAKER_01]: people are missing out on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the actual understanding of what
they're feeding their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people grow and don't even know
what NPK is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be understanding all of this
stuff and organic really teaches you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being around your plants all the time,
making these things, feeding it to them,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's another connection with nature and
that whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was Jeremy from Build a Soil
who said, there's a certain romance about
[SPEAKER_03]: the end quality product of organics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you feel the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has something special about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's organic, sun-grown, it's at its
most natural way of how it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's just the perfect way basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned earlier that you do a lot of
your own ferments and things like that
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you get much into the whole KNF type of
thing or are you just starting to dip your
[SPEAKER_03]: toes into the whole water of all the
various ferments and how all that
[SPEAKER_03]: interacts with it all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm just like, this is what I'm
looking into more because before I came
[SPEAKER_01]: out to Spain when I was doing organics
before, a lot of it was a lot of bottled
[SPEAKER_01]: feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd use some slow-release powdered
amendments and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this way of doing it is... Well,
I used to do nettle teas with the garden
[SPEAKER_01]: and comfrey teas and stuff like that,
but then this whole fermenting and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, this is all new, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking into all this now.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's some of the newest products or
ideas you're looking to delve into or
[SPEAKER_03]: implement in your own garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like you were saying then,
builder soil and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been looking into a few of these
other companies that do these amendments
[SPEAKER_01]: and definitely trying to use a few broader
variety of things in my feeds and soil
[SPEAKER_01]: mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even composting, I'm starting to do a lot
more composting and I used to have a worm
[SPEAKER_01]: farm and stuff like that in the UK and
quite a few bins of worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I need to get more into that,
so yeah, definitely look towards that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does the Spanish scene have a builder soil
equivalent?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a place where you can get all of
the amendments you're after or is it still
[SPEAKER_03]: a bit of a struggle?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I've sort of... It definitely
needs... It's lacking on that side,
[SPEAKER_01]: but as progression happens, more of these
stores will start to get these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see a store that only stocks
organic products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not seen that so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be a really good thing
to do out here in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because all of these products are
hard to get and it's quite a big
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural industry over here,
but they like to spray a lot of chemicals
[SPEAKER_01]: and chemical fertilizers on everything,
so yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how your voice just like trailed
off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how would you describe the scene in
general in Spain?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it mostly people growing organic
outdoors given there's the availability or
[SPEAKER_03]: is it pretty well infiltrated by that
commercial scene as you referenced with
[SPEAKER_03]: the synthetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, any of the commercial standard of
Spanish cannabis is quite low,
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how they're growing it,
but everything has a certain smell or
[SPEAKER_01]: taste to it when I see it, so I'm not too
sure what some of these people do use,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, not organic, but then everybody
that grows for themselves on a personal
[SPEAKER_01]: level tends to go down the organic line,
which is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bit of a weird political question.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you rather do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you rather live in a situation where
it's illegal but you're growing your own
[SPEAKER_03]: or it's legal but the only people
supplying it are big corporations and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of question marks over the
quality and safety checks in the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: process?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it has to be legalized to be normalized
and not be felt like a criminal,
[SPEAKER_01]: then that's the line we have to go down,
but decriminalizing it is the way forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hard question, but I think it needs
to go legal and
be...
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it should be put in the
government's hands, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's enough people out there
that can... There's ways of regulating it
[SPEAKER_01]: in different ways, but it's not how it
will go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, just touching on the idea of
regulation, you referenced earlier that
[SPEAKER_03]: you think the price of weed should go
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just move that idea over to seeds,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing a general increase in the
price of seeds as time goes by.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some say it's in accordance with
inflation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Others say it's getting out of hand in
some respects.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think there should be some
regulation on the price of seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: ultimately?
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds are worth what people can sell
them for.
[SPEAKER_01]: My seeds, I think, in general,
are quite cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I could even maybe lower the price
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on how much work was involved in
each strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some feminized strains don't produce many
seeds, so you have to charge a bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I think it's gone crazy with when
people are charging $300, $400,
[SPEAKER_01]: $500 a packet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it's the market that people pay
this, and then people think, if
[SPEAKER_01]: something's $500 and something's $50,
the $500 one's got to be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people buy by price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so many people, we do it in the
shops, we do it with food, we do it with
[SPEAKER_01]: clothes, and so people do it with seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do you think that there are,
or should I say, do you think that there
[SPEAKER_03]: is a max price which no one should go
over?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think it's just really like,
you know, if you want it and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: willing to pay, go for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd pay a high amount for a special packet
of something old, maybe, that wasn't about
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, if I play devil's advocate,
do you remember Starfighter?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there were some auctions for a
while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that got, you know,
very expensive very quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, do you think that was out of
hand or like, that's the type of thing
[SPEAKER_03]: which merits what you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, auctions are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when it was, I think it was the
alien technology went onto auction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, it was like, it went at crazy
prices for a packet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people have used that in the future
for breeding stock, add a good little
[SPEAKER_01]: story behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, certain things sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to have a release of, and if you've
got thousands of packets and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: charging a huge amount for each packet,
I think that's down to morals,
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: A topic you just briefly touched on,
auctions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen a dramatic rise in the number
of auctions, especially on Instagram
[SPEAKER_03]: recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it feel like we have too many
auctions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are auctions a bad thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the thing I noticed mostly is that
people will often discredit really
[SPEAKER_03]: expensive purchases and say, oh yeah,
but it was for an auction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, kind of like different rules
are in play right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, if they're just constantly
happening, is it not the new norm?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you talking like charity auctions or
is it like just general auctions?
[SPEAKER_03]: The majority of them are charity auctions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't think I've really seen-
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: For charity, but yeah, it seems like
they're just nonstop now on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever you look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a couple popping up and I
donated some seeds and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember checking on their go for
like crazy price for one packet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it's for a good cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's more and more and more of them
popping up, maybe people need to look into
[SPEAKER_01]: it a little bit more about, you know,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see it as a bad thing if it's for
charity and it's for a good cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: People do it all the time with other
industries and people will hold auctions
[SPEAKER_01]: and parties and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, why not do it with some seeds
as well if it goes to a good cause?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last question for the extended response.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is breeding an art or a science?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, do you think that you could pass
all your knowledge onto someone or at the
[SPEAKER_03]: end of the day, you need to have a certain
something within you, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a sense or a knack, whatever it may
be you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that, yeah, it's an art or
it's a science?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say it's a mix of both, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just things that you've learned along
the way and some things can't even be
explained.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just through things that you've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely you can teach people a lot
and save them a lot of time by telling
[SPEAKER_01]: them what you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say it's a mix of both definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit of art and a bit of science all
mixed in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now for our last little quickfire
segment.
[SPEAKER_03]: First question.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go back to one place in time,
in history, anywhere you want,
[SPEAKER_03]: where would you go and what land race
seeds would you be after?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, the 60s, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghanistan and maybe some old Persian
seeds would be nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, exotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the worst thing to happen to the EU
scene since you've been active in it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so not just since you moved to
Spain, since you've, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: been essentially online or even just
talking to people down the block.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit, feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ones that just don't even smell and taste
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what's your current favorite
strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say from this year, out of my things,
Jungle Juice and Jungle Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of other people's stuff, I like
Baldi's Soulmate this year and South Fork
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds, Cherry Can.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the things that are standing out
this year from outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's your favorite of all time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm really happy to have the Bubba
Kush back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just had that back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking forward to that at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the list is too long just to pick
one, but I'm happy to get the Bubba back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think SFV, OG Kush, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: SFV and Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people love the SFV, don't they?
[SPEAKER_03]: So next question though, what is the worst
strain you've ever had the privilege of
[SPEAKER_03]: trying or growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown a few packets of greenhouse
stuff that a friend gave me that it
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that I bought, okay,
I bought a packet of Soma seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: NYC Diesel, expecting a nice NYC Diesel
thing and didn't find the NYC Diesel I was
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a little bit disappointing,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think random seeds that people
give you and you think, okay, I'll try it
[SPEAKER_01]: out years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just find a lot of shit stuff from
that as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the biggest mistake you see
people making when they're growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Overfeeding, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Giving the plant too many bottled feeds,
thinking that this is gonna do this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is gonna do that, that's gonna do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they end up with weed that's had a
buildup, doesn't burn very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think people that add too much to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's a little breeding tip for all
the aspiring breeders out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick your favorite female, one that you've
worked with a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any packet of seeds that you've grown out
that you find in a lot of females you
[SPEAKER_01]: like, collect a little bit of pollen,
dust it on something, grow those seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: out, give them out for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's the best tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that one just about wraps it up
for us.

[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to thank anyone that's grown up

online, entered into cups.
