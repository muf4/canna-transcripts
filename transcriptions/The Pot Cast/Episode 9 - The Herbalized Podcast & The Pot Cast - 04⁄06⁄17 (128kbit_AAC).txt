[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
The Podcast, a cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_01]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode, as always, was brought to us
by our regular sponsors, 420 Australia and
[SPEAKER_01]: OGS.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode is a little different than
normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be going over some details for the
next-gen counter cup, as well as some
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia-related issues in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: My apologies to our international friends
for this episode is not as interesting to
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So stay tuned and we hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's talk about, to get it out of
the way, let's talk about what inspired
[SPEAKER_03]: the next-gen counter cup and kind of how
long it's been in the works.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of how long it's been in the
works, we've been thinking about it for
[SPEAKER_02]: probably about the best part of six
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason was simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it all started with the idea of
like, well, how can we progress the scene
[SPEAKER_02]: from our end, at least as growers?
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea was simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, the biggest problem I have is
like, I see lots of people putting like
[SPEAKER_02]: their hard resources and time into growing
things and they're just not growing good
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, you could really just
not have to put any more effort in and
[SPEAKER_02]: just get a substantially better product
just by changing the genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to stress that to people,
but people often get very kind of attached
[SPEAKER_02]: to their choice in genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand why it's because like,
you know, before you ever buy seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you do a little bit of research and you
kind of decide the ones you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, yeah, that's the right
choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for someone to come along and be
like, no, that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand you're going to get defensive
at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bit of ego there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, so what we thought was,
well, like, how can we get just genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: into the hands of people and not be like
ramming it down their throats?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we thought, yeah, well,
like we, we want to have a cup,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like truth be told, if there weren't
any prizes, it just wouldn't be worth
[SPEAKER_02]: doing because like, I really don't care to
know who grows the best weed in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's really like a peripheral part
of it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The major part of it to me is yeah,
like the prizes afterwards and being able
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we thought, yeah, the prizes as
well as just the cup itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we basically decided, yeah,
we need to get some prizes sorted,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we've been in the process of doing
for a while now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thankfully we've had a lot of support
from a lot of like international breeders,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, as well as even some Australian people
kicking in some prizes, which would be
[SPEAKER_02]: cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and yeah, basically we want to be
able to reward the people who enter,
[SPEAKER_02]: but more importantly, we wanted an avenue
to be able to let everyone get involved,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like just even the casual
punter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was why we thought the majority of
the prizes will be auctioned off and just
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone can bid on those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you haven't entered a sample,
you might be thinking about getting into
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to, you know, provide an
opportunity to get some really good
[SPEAKER_02]: quality genetics and they'll, they'll be
domestic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll already be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you don't have to wait postage or
anything like that, which is another big
[SPEAKER_02]: thing about why people don't order tons of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, it's kind of like running
the gauntlet each time you have to go
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So overall we think it's going to be an
awesome opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Hey, even if like you're just a
smoker, there'll be half Oz's of each
[SPEAKER_02]: entry up for auctions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If those top entries, like, you know,
say one through to five will be by
[SPEAKER_02]: definition, really frigging good smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lots of people will be trying to get
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there seems like there's something for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're trying to make it that way as
well as making it overall a charity,
[SPEAKER_02]: which each year will pick a cause and that
just to sweeten the deal even more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know there's been some,
some mixed reactions from the community in
[SPEAKER_03]: like where the, the charity chosen this
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and look, I can understand how it
might rub some people the wrong way,
[SPEAKER_03]: but ultimately I think like, if,
if you're going to put on a cup of any
[SPEAKER_03]: sort, um, you kind of can model it any way
you want to, and people will choose to
[SPEAKER_03]: enter it or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you do at the end of the day,
if you put it all in your own pocket,
[SPEAKER_03]: you put it all into a project,
you put it all into whatever is kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: ultimately that person's decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the idea of saying that like
someone is more worthy of charity than
[SPEAKER_02]: someone else doesn't really sit with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not what charity is about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what it's about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about helping out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing is, you know,
there'll always be someone who will
[SPEAKER_02]: believe that someone else is a better
cause, you know, so we don't even want to
[SPEAKER_02]: get into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we already just said that there was
some serious logistical reasons as to why
[SPEAKER_02]: we picked Matt Farmer because he really
kindly offered to throw in a ton of prizes
[SPEAKER_02]: to the point where basically most people
who enter will get a prize regardless of
[SPEAKER_02]: where they place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just that, that in itself made the
cup feasibly, sorry, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_02]: feasibly possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, it's a sad thing that you kind
of even have to justify it, but I just
[SPEAKER_03]: wanted to bring it up so that it could be
out there for everyone to know that it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's, there's no, you know, it's a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, we could, we could run the cup
with no charity component, but like,
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of the undertone people
take with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, would you rather we don't
do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So honestly that, that, that only popped
up for like a day or two after the initial
[SPEAKER_02]: announcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then very quickly people kind of
understood that like, yeah, charity is
[SPEAKER_02]: charity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can't helping someone,
helping someone at the end of the day.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you want, do you want to give a
quick breakdown?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I know you're going to have a,
you're going to have two, you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have concentrates and you're going to have
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So give a breakdown of how you would
submit an entry and where to get in touch
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully by the end of this week,
we will have a set date for when entries
[SPEAKER_02]: can be accepted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the rules state that the judges can
only test one sample per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not sure if other comps have that
rule, but we feel that's like one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: most important rules there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spoken to people who've judged it,
you know, cannabis events around the world
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that is a big problem in
factoring the scoring.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, once you've tried one or two
strains within a day, by the time you get
[SPEAKER_03]: to five or six, how can you, what real
determinations can you be making apart
[SPEAKER_03]: from perhaps taste?
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I think that's a, that's a really
cool thing that you guys are doing there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as a result of that, when we kind
of got an indication that there was a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of people interested, we knew that we had
to pull the entry date back because
[SPEAKER_02]: there'll only be, you know, so many days
in between when entries need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: accepted before we announced the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a result of that, there'll only be
so many applicants at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've got like room for 25 or 30
in each category, which to be honest,
[SPEAKER_02]: we've received the indication that like we
could get to those numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's even more people kind of
sitting on the fence, then who knows they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they may either miss out or we might have
to pull the entry date a little bit back
[SPEAKER_02]: more, but we don't really want to do that
because the whole idea was that where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: set now, I mean, one, you know,
it's like, you know, kind of the stone of
[SPEAKER_02]: pop culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on seven, 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, more so than that, it was like about
six months from when we announced it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like, you've still got time to
pop whatever you want, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so like no one can complain that they
weren't given enough notice basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, if we keep pulling the date back
further and further, then that wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_02]: the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not going to do that,
but yeah, the rules will be, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of the categories, there'll be,
two categories, as you said, flower and
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we could potentially split it further
this year, but into say Indica and Sativa
[SPEAKER_02]: categories and possibly solventless versus
solvent based.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we'd have to then double the
prizes as we would now have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of just two first places,
two second places, two third place,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, we'd now have four of each.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would also further have to double
the amount of time taken to test or get
[SPEAKER_02]: more judges on board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which would result in people having to
submit more weed at the entry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just didn't want to have to go down
all that route.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for this year, we're just keeping it
restricted in a sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason for that is because,
and this is kind of the big announcement,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I don't know if I've really told
everyone is that where the whole point of
[SPEAKER_02]: this is because next year we're going to
have a physical event.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have liked to have had a physical
event this year, but given that it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: first year, there'd be no guarantee that
people would make the effort to come from
[SPEAKER_02]: places far and wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you might get a local turnout,
but so, so the idea was let's do it online
[SPEAKER_02]: for the first year, make it really
successful and then ensure that people
[SPEAKER_02]: will make the effort to come to a physical
event next year, which we've already
[SPEAKER_02]: secured.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I look forward to hearing more and
more about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically, uh, just to summarize,
we want the people who are submitting it
[SPEAKER_02]: to be the people who have produced the
flower or made the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, if you're not the grower of,
of the material for the concentrate,
[SPEAKER_02]: we want you to be able to give us all the
same details we would require if you were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you basically need to know
the person and be able to get this
[SPEAKER_02]: information off them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and there's a few basic bits of
information we want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to know, you know, that the
genetics are the, whether it's being grown
[SPEAKER_02]: organically or synthetically, and finally
a few other little bits of information
[SPEAKER_02]: just relating to the grower and
identification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the way you will enter is
really simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: You let us know that you want to enter and
you go to the go fund me, which will be
[SPEAKER_02]: set up very soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will not be in our control.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be in mad farmers control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we won't see any of the money from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't see any of the money from this
ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once you pay that it's,
it's visible on the site, but he'll also
[SPEAKER_02]: let us know and we'll send out a package
to the contestant, um, filled with both
[SPEAKER_02]: instructions and as well as my lab bags
and it'll have, it'll tell you how much to
[SPEAKER_02]: put in each bag, how to zip it all up as
well as a return bag and an M sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: and an address.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically it's pretty easy to
submit your sample, you know, like there's
[SPEAKER_02]: an instruction sheet literally and for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, you just go from there,
you submit it in and we have a final date
[SPEAKER_02]: for receiving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this was a point I wanted to
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: That day is not the day you have to get it
in the mailbox.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the day we have to receive it by,
because that's when testing starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's that date again?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the date is the 10th of
September.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, that leaves room for about,
you know, between 25 and 28, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: contestants, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other big thing to note is,
um, because it's online this year,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was really paramount that the judging
be a hundred percent transparent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise there's just no point,
you know, even entering if you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: faith in the judging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so essentially all entries will be
uploaded, you know, high quality photos
[SPEAKER_02]: along with the scorecards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, like you can,
you, you can literally cross compare,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like if you think something's
got awesome bag appeal and then you check
[SPEAKER_02]: the scorecard and it's marked one,
like it'll, it'll be obvious to say that
[SPEAKER_02]: something dodgy is going on, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a hundred percent transparent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the fact that you guys are doing
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually wrote notes about that because
I don't know that many other events do
[SPEAKER_03]: that either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'd be great also for an international
standpoint for people to be able to see
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that, that went in and what's
happening down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned that we've contacted,
um, a few of the international cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: publications without naming names and at
least one of them has expressed some
[SPEAKER_02]: interest in possibly documenting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I think that it, it might go
ahead, but most certainly next year,
[SPEAKER_02]: there'll be, there'll be some
international presence there, which will
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of beef the status of the event of,
I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you would, I'm, we're hoping that
next year will be, um, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: really something special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that this year will really
pave the way for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my hat goes off to you guys and I'm
sure it's been a lot of hard work and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, some stressful moments as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, anything we can do as you get
closer to it to help you promote it and
[SPEAKER_03]: share it around, keep in touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause, uh, yeah, we really liked the idea
of what you're doing and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully it inspires some other events as
well of the, of the same nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's, um, it'd be great to see
like, cause the edible scene is getting
[SPEAKER_03]: really big here too, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's actually a good point where
we're strongly considering having an
[SPEAKER_02]: edible section because we've had a lot of
interest and in adding an edible section,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would just be one extra section.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can accommodate that in regards to
prizes is not a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's looking very popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had to be honest, waiting on like one
more person to message me and say they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to enter an edible entry and then
they'll officially announce it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe this will be the tipping point on
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I dropped the hint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Send me the DM.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, now when you're not organizing
Australia's cannabis cup, you are also
[SPEAKER_03]: growing some amazing cannabis of your own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And alongside doing that, hosting the
podcast, um, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: probably my other favorite Australian
cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thank you sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so what inspired the, you know,
you starting the podcast?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we talked a little bit about it at
the start of the show, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: recognizing that there was kind of a more
of a receptive community for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what was the inspiration in really
getting the show going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I know at the start, we,
we talked about it and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: about even possibly working together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately I think it's, it's great
that we didn't and that we went out in
[SPEAKER_03]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I just quickly referenced that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea how the show would turn out
at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what I was thinking at the time
was that it would be like really short,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, like sound by a short even.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking like, maybe it could even
like slide in as a little segment on your
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, that, that totally changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I don't even know why really,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I just started writing questions
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized like, I've got a lot more
questions here than what you could fit
[SPEAKER_02]: into a sound bite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, well, it just becomes pretty
organic, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'll admit a lot of pretty much 95% of
the questions I ask I've pre-written and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's because I don't know, I,
I get so wrapped up in the story as I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: listening to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost struggle to, um, kind of like
view it critically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And be like, Oh, but what happened there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you didn't, you didn't really wrap up
that little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for me, I'm just listening to the
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, Oh, the story goes on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, I, I definitely put a lot of
effort into it before each interview
[SPEAKER_02]: because I had, I have, I've had,
I've done one of the interviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't say which one, and it wasn't a bad
interview or anything, but I thought I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: written like lots of questions and we just
blasted through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, I felt like we didn't
have enough material and we ended up,
[SPEAKER_02]: we did, it was fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, I just felt like we didn't at the
time and I just felt so nervous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, fuck, I never want to
be in this position again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm always going to try to have
excess of questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I put a lot of
pressure on myself to try to write good
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't want to ask anything which
has already been asked or like you could
[SPEAKER_02]: just easily Google and so yeah,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that in mind, it takes time
because after like say 30 or 45 minutes of
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to think of like some interesting
questions that they just all become shit
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, you had a, you had a really
strong online presence via your Heavy Days
[SPEAKER_03]: account.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, we talked a little bit before
about the people that go down the Warren
[SPEAKER_03]: Halls and how important they are for the
culture and for it getting expanded.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, by that getting geeky and
really going down and the guests that
[SPEAKER_03]: you've kind of chosen and highlighted
through the way have been a really great
[SPEAKER_03]: reflection of those people that go down
the Warren Halls.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or on the other scale, people who go down
the Warren Hall tend to find these guests
[SPEAKER_03]: of yours somewhere along the way as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the reason for that is because
yeah, I'm down that hole and I'm picking
[SPEAKER_02]: people who I want to talk to mostly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got like just this long list of
people I want to interview and most of
[SPEAKER_02]: them have already said yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just as like a little side note,
anyone who ever messages me and is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, you know, I can get this person on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that like I don't want to
interview them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got such a big list already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just because yeah, like I want
to and that really helps with writing the
[SPEAKER_02]: questions because I've had a lot of people
request someone and I tried to start
[SPEAKER_02]: writing questions for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually what I do before I even
message them and ask them because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I want to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some stuff to ask them basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some ones where like it was just one
where a lot of people asked for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, yeah, I was really struggling to
write questions because yeah, I just kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of read all the history and just try to be
really critical of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like, what happened there?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so yeah, if you're not
interested in it, it's hard to get
[SPEAKER_02]: involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So last year, we almost crossed paths.
[SPEAKER_03]: We almost did this in the flesh.
[SPEAKER_03]: You managed to be in Cali for the Cannabis
Cup down in where were you again?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonoma.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So did you get to record any stuff down
there and live and in the flesh?
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been so lazy editing at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, a lot of it, a lot of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got, I recorded like two interviews,
one of them's online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recorded the Mr. Soul one in flesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recorded like, I'll say like half of one
with my boy from dynasty, but we were like
[SPEAKER_02]: just so, we went out the night before and
we were just so tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so we had to like wrap up halfway
through and we still got to finish that
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got a lot of footage,
but like, I don't know, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to, I guess I'm just going to get
everything on YouTube because yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: like obviously SoundCloud doesn't support
any footage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess my motivation to get all
that finished up is just being put to the
[SPEAKER_02]: side for the moment.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now your heavy days page is, you know,
probably one of the better known pages as
[SPEAKER_03]: far as Australian breeders go.
[SPEAKER_03]: The photos you show up are absolute weed
porn.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, you, and you obviously a big
proponent of, of growing organic cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a first time, grower, somebody who
might be listening, thinking about setting
[SPEAKER_03]: something up at home, what, what would be
a reasonable place to kind of think about
[SPEAKER_03]: getting started?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've had a lot of people ask me
about seed banks and reliable sources on
[SPEAKER_03]: sourcing genetics and making sure that you
start with something good to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, and that, that ties into what I was
talking about earlier, where it's like for
[SPEAKER_02]: no extra effort, you'll get a way better
product just for the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because it's really simple in
biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's this, this is actually a biology
equation and it basically says that the
[SPEAKER_02]: end product of whatever we're talking
about in a genetic sense is the result of
[SPEAKER_02]: three variables, genetics, environment,
and then other factors, which are usually
[SPEAKER_02]: combinations of synergistic things between
the two, as well as just other random
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental factors that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So more or less they have assigned that,
you know, the genetic part gets
[SPEAKER_02]: approximately 40%, the environmental part
gets approximately 40% and then the other
[SPEAKER_02]: factors get approximately 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that means is like, you know,
literally a minimum of 40% of the end
[SPEAKER_02]: result of your grow is determined by the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, it's a lot more than that,
but the bare minimum, like you should try
[SPEAKER_02]: to consider that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're only running like mediocre
genetics, maybe they're only running at
[SPEAKER_02]: say half their capacity, like 20% instead
of 40.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, yeah, it really adds up and
it's, it's literally no more effort at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're a, you know, a home grower,
you're looking to maybe get your own
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine, where would you recommend one,
like in terms of the soil composition,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you're, if you're going inside,
if you don't have the opportunity to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: it outdoors, are there some sort of bare
minimums that you need to start with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, for organic, that was what
got me so into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the rev is a, an online figure who
writes for the skunk magazine and he's,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's a really kind of charismatic
presenter and he's very powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's passionate about organics and he was
the one who got me into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was this video he had on YouTube
and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually a seminar he gave at the
Emerald Cup, I think it was 2005,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for whatever reason it's been taken
down, unfortunately, and it doesn't seem
[SPEAKER_02]: to be anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: But long story short, in that video,
he basically highlights the point that
[SPEAKER_02]: like the reason why organics is so good is
because it, there's so many different ways
[SPEAKER_02]: to make it work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas with, you know, synthetics,
there's kind of like more of a recipe,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is like more of a one way works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, his, his whole
philosophy was like, just give it a go,
[SPEAKER_02]: literally just get yourself some good
compost, get yourself some good,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, potting mix, potting soil,
grow a plant in it, just give it water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it really needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your product is going to be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to get a whole ton of it,
but it's going to be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something which I really liked
about organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you like fucked up a bit,
it more so just affected the yield,
[SPEAKER_02]: not the quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like first time around,
you'd get really good stuff and it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck, this is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I just need to try to work on getting
some more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like for me, that's not a problem,
but I think that that's a good starting
[SPEAKER_02]: spot for a lot of people because I started
out being a bottle nutrient grower and I
[SPEAKER_02]: got reasonable yields, but it was pretty,
it's pretty shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like the first time I grew
organics, it was like a game changer in
[SPEAKER_02]: terms of the quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was, it was full on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's yeah, like I'm really passionate
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess if someone wanted to get into
it, as I said, honestly, if you just like
[SPEAKER_02]: putting your toe in the water,
like just go get some good compost,
[SPEAKER_02]: go get some good potting mix with compost
on the bottom half of the pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: put the potting mix on the top half and
start growing your plant and just,
[SPEAKER_02]: just get some water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like literally that's all you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, obviously have like lights
and shit like that, but that's really it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, and if you want to go really
down the worm hole, you can then start to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at more advanced stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the stuff I use, it's like,
I kind of get given it real cheap by my
[SPEAKER_02]: friends over at OGS who they do like a
real good job, but again, like if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: just thinking about it, like don't,
don't bother with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just get your toe, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, there's no point buying a high
end camera just to see if you're into
[SPEAKER_02]: photography.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's kind of like a little bit like
we were talking before, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like give people a little taste first,
like have a taste diet with just water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, you'll be encouraged
next time around and start tweaking a few
[SPEAKER_03]: variables and start making your yield a
little bit more productive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll, you'll start to geek out a
little bit on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, to me, people who are really
passionate about organics, the yield tends
[SPEAKER_02]: to not be their concern.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're interested in producing
clean, good quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, if yields are made of concern of
yours, I would never even recommend really
[SPEAKER_02]: looking into organics unless you're
committed to really learn it because you
[SPEAKER_02]: can still get just as good of a yield,
but you've, you know, it's still got a
[SPEAKER_02]: learning curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, I spent harvest last year at a
pure organics cannabis farm in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, when you've got the
opportunity and the means to do it with,
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can do it on a huge scale and
your yield can be phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like, that's a thing which a
lot of people don't think like,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause the hydro mags have kind of always
said that for a long time being like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it might be better quality, but we can
grow lots more of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for the business minded person,
that sounded really appealing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I mean, that's not even the case
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more so like, if you are really
business minded in that sense,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you should probably talk to someone
else because that's not what I'm about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in the world of fruit and veg
and everything else, organic fetch is a
[SPEAKER_03]: premium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why shouldn't it in the world of
cannabis as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's, that's certainly the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know people on both ends of the
spectrum where there's, I know people who
[SPEAKER_02]: grow organically and as a result,
they're able to charge more and I know
[SPEAKER_02]: people who grow organically and they still
give it for the same price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that those, the customers of
those later people, like they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got it good and they don't know
what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that goes back a lot to what
you're doing with the cup as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also what we talked about before about
the depth of knowledge really starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: expand in the Australian community where,
you know, the more technical terms around
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis when we're not really discussed,
let alone strains even, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: growing up and hearing about strains,
it was virtually unheard of.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's quite prevalent throughout
the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really an interesting topic because
that same point was kind of echoed by a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the, the people I've interviewed,
you know, like in the past people didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really seem to care so much about the
strain names or like trying to get like
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of information about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was just more like, how does it
make me feel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's all I really care about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as a result of that, there was a
lot of like misnaming of stuff because
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, people didn't care about the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might've had some real good stuff
and you found some seeds in it and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: boy, it would be great to know what this
stuff was actually was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you bought the seeds and maybe you use
them, but like now you just got to name
[SPEAKER_02]: them something because you don't really
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, yeah, that's like a bit of a
problem, but yeah, it's really interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: how the names have become more popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my theory around it, at least in
relation to myself is the more strains
[SPEAKER_02]: that come out, the more, you know,
there's more kind of like little micro
[SPEAKER_02]: domains that you can become expert in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you might be like,
well, I really like Indica's and
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly I like Afghani's.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be like, try to collect
all the Afghani's I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll try to become like real good at
picking up those elements when I smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: other strains or whatever, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, there's all these little
areas where you can, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: become like a little even micro
connoisseur amongst flavors, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas before it was like, maybe you were
just known as the dude who smoked a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: good weed or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was hard to, hard to carve your
identity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people would just stick names on
things to try and make them sound cool
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I read this story hypothesizing that
a lot of the strains back in the day that
[SPEAKER_02]: had super in them, like it was just like,
it didn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like, you know, like so super
skunks, the big example, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of people say, if you look online,
a lot of sites will tell you that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: across a regular skunk to Afghani,
which was true for what one breeder did.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I think for the majority of it,
it was just like really good batches of
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's like in Brazil, I mean,
they have kind of two types of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the brown, which is just like
brick weed from over the border.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get access to skunk and skunk
is just covers anything that's better than
[SPEAKER_03]: brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that was kind of the case in
the UK for a long time as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where it just, well, it could very well
have stemmed from there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know that like for them,
it was like, cause they didn't even really
[SPEAKER_02]: refer to cheese as cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just still call it skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know at least when I went over there
in 2010, it was the case that,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, it was like, there was still a lot
of brick weed coming in from various
[SPEAKER_02]: places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had got some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you could also get like skunk,
which was like, when they explained it to
[SPEAKER_02]: me at the time, I remember thinking,
this just sounds like the equivalent of
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, like Bush and Hydro in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're getting Hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, there's been a kind of a bit of a
boom in the, in the Aussie cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, outside of the plant itself,
it seems that there are a few people like
[SPEAKER_03]: for seeing, for seeing a green rush,
you've got vaporizer companies starting
[SPEAKER_03]: up, add to that, the whole host of
medicinal things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I even saw like a hemp drink release.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess now with the, the change from
food standards with them allowing us to
[SPEAKER_03]: consume hemp now, we're going to see a lot
more of that becoming quite prevalent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good take on all of that, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've heard that hemp's got lots of
antioxidants and stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, even if you want to just look
at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I always try to look at things from
like the most ultimate pessimistic view.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically I try to look at things from
the view of like what a current medical
[SPEAKER_02]: doctor would look at them, which is like
someone who like probably doesn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: support marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, even they would have to
agree that like a drink like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's got like lots of antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you could theoretically make it
low calorie if, you know, you don't stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: it full of sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, there's lots of other things that
could be, you know, like all the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavonoids, just depending on how they did
like the, whatever type of the hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts in there, like you could,
you could make it all the way up to being
[SPEAKER_02]: like almost like a full extract type thing
just without the actual cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and if you look at like extract of
most things, they appear to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: effective than like oil or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the extrapolation is that there's
stuff in there, which is doing the extra.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you might be getting that in the
drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that'd be cool in regards to
all the vapes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm not a big vape dude myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my buddy Gerald the hand, he's got
like the best vape I've ever had in that
[SPEAKER_02]: it hooks up to like a bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, you can still pull it through
a bong if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, and it delivers like a real good
hit, whereas most I've tried to,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like a different high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like for me, I'm, I always laugh at
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a bong bitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was brought up on them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, same way, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've probably heard a couple being sucked
down along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to switch over to most of the
vapes when you come from bongs because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're used to that big hit and yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this one, this one I tried from
Gerald, it's just pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking about getting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you remember what it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he'll kill me for not knowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he loves it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's got like an active fan in
it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, it's actively pushing it
down the stem of the bong and then you,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets a good amount of smoke out in a
relatively short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's like the big part is
like trying to simulate a bong here,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is essentially that like big hit,
small amount of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know before we sort of started
kicking it off, you were talking about an
[SPEAKER_03]: article that you've been writing at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a good segue for me to talk
about something that we've kind of covered
[SPEAKER_03]: a little bit, but you know, I guess one of
the demons of the Aussie Canada was saying
[SPEAKER_03]: is, is PGR weed and, and a lot of people
don't even know what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know that it's a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the first, the first I ever
heard of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first they think Australians ever
heard of it was I got a good friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't drop his name because I can't
think of like an alter ego name for him
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's on Reddit and he was,
he was the first one I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was the one who posted something
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like the first article I ever
read about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was like three or four years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember reading about it at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, this is, this is
interesting because this is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always had the suspicion that
something like this was going on because
[SPEAKER_02]: to me, I always used to think like,
what, how come all like quote hydro weed
[SPEAKER_02]: in Australia has like that similar feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you get like that rubber band feeling
around your head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I used to describe it as like
just a brick to the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just, just knocks you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always used to wonder like,
surely not all the growers are using the
[SPEAKER_02]: same strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just can't be the case really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I, I realized that like a lot of
it, a lot of that, those unpleasant
[SPEAKER_02]: feelings are caused by the PGRs
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more so the reason why all the weed
looks the same is because I mean some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the strains are shared between the big
growers, but more so the, the PGRs
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves cause the plants to look a
particular way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why, you know, the hydro looks
quite similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that in mind, which lent itself to
the, it lent itself to like the myth,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, cause it was like, this is the
good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you notice it, it looks,
it's got covered in red hairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really dense and you know,
kind of fat nugs, you know, that are all
[SPEAKER_03]: really dense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that became the myth for a lot of
people that that was the good weed to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never, I'm quite young, so I was never
getting weed when it was good,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the first time I bought weed would
have been like around like the 2008,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2009 period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe a year or two earlier,
like just, but yeah, about then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was always rampant PGR stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, I never, yeah, I never thought
it was good or bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely thought it was better than
Bush in the sense that I just thought Bush
[SPEAKER_02]: was trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, that type of sativa
that is typically called Bush is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just doesn't really speak to me anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a big fan of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the things to, to look out for
with it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the interesting part because
it's really, it's really kind of hard
[SPEAKER_02]: unless you've got just exposure to seeing
a lot of PGR weed because there are a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of little variations and.
[SPEAKER_03]: And PGR, sorry, it's plant growth
regulators, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically, these are, these are
chemicals which are trying to mimic
[SPEAKER_02]: natural chemicals the plant would make.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, they've got a lot of unwanted
side effects in the human body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, if the, if the companies could just
make the natural chemicals themselves,
[SPEAKER_02]: that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for whatever reason, like they're not
uptaken through the roots or you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like you can't water the plant
with it and get it into the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for that reason, you got to give it a
different chemical that will get in and
[SPEAKER_02]: try to replicate the effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, a lot of the molecules
themselves have got, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: like carcinogenic properties or just,
they disrupt sperm matters or,
[SPEAKER_02]: and as a result result in like,
you know, cause this was a, this was a
[SPEAKER_02]: typical thing I got told growing up,
you know, like if you smoke stems,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll have like to form sperm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I used to laugh at that,
but it's actually true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like PGRs literally do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cause sperm matters or disruption.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for those kinds of reasons in most
like of the, for instance, the States in,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the U S those where you have legit
grows, you're definitely not allowed to
[SPEAKER_03]: use PGRs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, if it's being tested,
then yeah, you definitely can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot of people seem to think it is
being used in the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a bit skeptical because I see photos
online all the time of people being like,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is PGR weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, it's still super crystal-y.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's just dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing, which I think a lot
of people don't understand is it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not just like really dense weed is
PGR weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like PGRs make the strain more dense
than it would have been.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you had a strain that was going to
be super airy, it might not even end up
[SPEAKER_02]: being like, you know, quote dense after
PGR use.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just be more dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so it's not just like a rule of thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, if you, you know,
like it could be the case that the most
[SPEAKER_02]: densest bud you've ever come across was
not PGR, you know, like, um, so yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a big one to remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think for me, the biggest one in my
opinion is the discoloration, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's, it's got like a weird gray dark
color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it looks like it's kind of almost been
vaporized sometimes or used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like someone had good bud and it's like
post-vaping bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've even heard rumors of people
blasting bud and then selling it like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to make BHO and then selling the
bud after.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard of that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the thing for that would be
though, that you'd have to be starting
[SPEAKER_02]: with good bud because I've heard of people
like trying to do extractions on PGR buds,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, you get horrible returns
because there's no trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, I could definitely see that
being possible if you had good weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and you gave it a blast and you
got it out and dried it for long enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it didn't smell like butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And admittedly like to the, to the
experienced smoker, you'd probably still
[SPEAKER_02]: pick up on it, but you know, to the,
to the novice, they probably don't be
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: There seems to be a bit of a rise in
concentrates as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously having a concentrate
section to your cup shows that it is
[SPEAKER_03]: happening, but definitely starting to see
it become more prevalent in the Aussie
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in the States and you know,
talking to young dudes like in their late
[SPEAKER_03]: teens, early twenties, and they're like,
you know, flowers are for old men.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, that's what my dad smokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd never touch that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just straight up doing dabs their
whole life, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, um, I'm in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm flower for life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, um, in Australia, I got a theory about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty simple, you know, weird shit here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's natural to want to try to make it
stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get concentrates, easy solve.
[SPEAKER_02]: In America, you got good flower though,
because that's the interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have told me like,
it's just because, you know, like
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually people are going to jack their
tolerance up and then, and then it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: where do you go to from dabs man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of me thinks it's like, it's a
mistake in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you do dabs and they're good
because they just, they fuck you up and
[SPEAKER_02]: then, and then you keep doing them and
then, and then you've done them for like a
[SPEAKER_02]: week and then you smoke some flower and it
just doesn't do anything for you anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like part of me thinks that's maybe what
happens to literally everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't know, like I just say to
people, like I meet a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_02]: are like concentrates only.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, as soon as someone says that to
me and they're Australian, I immediately
[SPEAKER_02]: think like, oh, you probably haven't had
like really good flower before.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And dabbed yourself out of being able to
appreciate the mild blood that you've got
[SPEAKER_03]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, but like, I mean, the one thing
I'll say in defense is maybe not a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: them would dab only, but a lot of them
were like mostly dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and after I have physically met up
with them and like shared some of my
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers, a lot of them would have been
like, yeah, like I'd be happy to smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, I don't, I can't pinpoint why
in the States they do it because yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: for me it's like, I just say to people,
I'm like, look, if you try like the most
[SPEAKER_02]: top end flowers, it's to me, it's on par
with the most top end concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it shouldn't be a case of like,
oh no, it's still better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think yeah, it's the tolerance thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also America's got like this big
thing about like just going super hard,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bigger, better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just, just go as hard as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well that, that kind of brings us around
again to the article that you were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about earlier and kind of starting that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you're in a, in a shitty
position where you can either only,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're, you're supplying people and you
can only get crappy weed or you're on the
[SPEAKER_03]: lower scale of that and you're only able
to find crappy weed for yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we need to start a conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within the community where we start to get
away from, from crappy weed and start
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at really good cannabis and
demanding it and finding a way for
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody to work together, growers and
suppliers to, to keep good cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: flowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's such a multifaceted problem,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this, there's so many parts,
which like, I feel like we should start on
[SPEAKER_02]: first, but it's hard to know where to an
interesting thing to notice.
[SPEAKER_02]: about that is that in my opinion,
if you're someone who makes like a
[SPEAKER_02]: substantial amount of money, like,
I don't know, because substantial is like
[SPEAKER_02]: a bit of a vague term.
[SPEAKER_02]: How should I put this?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, if you're the type of person who's
like a dealer, but you're just,
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of helping mates out,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe getting cheap weed for yourself or
something in the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I think if you're at the point
where you're actually pocketing money from
[SPEAKER_02]: it and you're selling shit stuff,
I think you've got an obligation to
[SPEAKER_02]: prioritize like literally actively looking
for a good source of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might take you forever to find it,
but like, there's nothing that annoys me
[SPEAKER_02]: more than like, I meet a dealer and
they're just like, Oh yeah, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just sell PGRs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's all I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, and, and, and do you look
for like a better source or anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, Oh yeah, like I did a
while ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, well, it's not going to
come fucking knocking on the door,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and, and so, yeah, like,
I mean, I think if you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if you're like a dealer for a
living and you're just dealing PGRs,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's, it's fucking your obligation to
like, try to find a better hookup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and as I said, you know, it's hard,
it's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not saying it has to happen,
but you've got to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, in regards to getting growers
and stuff to link up, it's, it's about
[SPEAKER_02]: forming good relationships, you know,
and, and good relationships are built on
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we mentioned this earlier,
but you know, like a good relationship is
[SPEAKER_02]: one where a buyer is not constantly trying
to bid down a seller.
[SPEAKER_02]: And likewise, a seller is not constantly
trying to pull the wool over the buyer's
[SPEAKER_02]: eyes in regards to quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I mean by that is,
is like there, there aren't really high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality dealers in Australia because of
several factors, but a big one is that a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people don't want to pay the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so until you are like happy to pay
prices, you're not going to find that
[SPEAKER_02]: dealer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the, the way I would tie into it
is, you know, if you meet someone who
[SPEAKER_02]: offers you weed for a higher price,
don't just instantly shy away.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you suspect ask them for a sample,
it's totally reasonable to ask for a
[SPEAKER_02]: sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like if you, even if you were
going to buy the smallest amount they were
[SPEAKER_02]: willing to offer you one cone is nothing
in compared in comparison to that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, even if it was like $50 worth
one cone is like $2 worth of weed at max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like it's totally reasonable to ask for
a sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's good, buy it and form a good
relationship with that person and don't
[SPEAKER_02]: try to beat them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't like ask them next week if you can
get it for five bucks cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like that's, that's a big problem.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like eventually the person will be
like, Oh man, everyone wants it cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they go and find a new source.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell anyone all of a sudden the weed
shooter and that ties in, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of people have had that story of
like, Oh yeah, like I've got this new
[SPEAKER_02]: dealer and like they were really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden it just dropped
off after like a month or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, because yeah, like people
just, you know, passively always kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to wear them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they think, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get this cheap rounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can give it to them a little cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also making some more money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like bottom line's lower now and
it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like this, you know, this bloody
slippery slope almost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, it's like self degenerating
and yeah, nasty circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, find someone, find someone
who's got weed you're happy with to pay
[SPEAKER_02]: the price and value that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're a good person, they'll
value you as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's at least how we think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the community is growing and
opening up enough now where if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: smart about it, those relationships,
you can start to make them and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: start to build them and start to find
like-minded people close by.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people message me asking for weed
and I usually don't reply, but some of
[SPEAKER_02]: them for whatever reason, and you probably
just dependent on the mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll decide to reply to them and
just like kind of ask why they're asking
[SPEAKER_02]: me this more or less, but most of the time
the answer I get is they're just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I've tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, when you say you tried,
do you mean like you've messaged other
[SPEAKER_02]: people randomly who you don't know just
asking for weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and it, cause it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's like, I form friendships with
people and you know, like probably takes a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time, but like eventually I'll like
maybe give them a bit of weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: like just unexpectedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll just, there you go, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, people, people don't seem
to understand that like that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's almost just how friendships work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't just, you don't just walk up to
someone and ask them for something
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like when you're, when you,
their friend, maybe they'll help you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't do it on the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I just say to people,
I'm like, look, I know you want weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe you should just try to make some
friends in the community and just chat to
[SPEAKER_02]: them and just get to know them for ages.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe eventually one of them will
offer you something like even as
[SPEAKER_02]: simplistic or as you know, reductionist as
that sounds, that really is like the most
[SPEAKER_02]: basic game plan you could have to try to
start scoring good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had no means of doing it in person,
like literally start making friends with
[SPEAKER_02]: people online.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't pester them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by that, I mean, don't ask them for
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't just, don't just ask them
questions, but like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like become friends with people,
like be genuine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reach out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people will sense the genuineness and
then that's when they won't feel weird
[SPEAKER_02]: about maybe helping you out a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's all about how you present
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, yeah, I know that maybe you
don't have weed now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really tempting to just ask for
some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's never going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other problem is they could never
understand the position you're in anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I don't expect them to have a
hundred percent, you know, ability to be
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Oh, well, if I was in his shoes,
I'd never help someone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't ask that because like,
yeah, they've never been in my position.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't know why, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's a bit of a unique one to be in,
but at the same time, they should be smart
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to know that like, yeah,
just getting a random message online for
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs is never going to result in a,
and if it did like fucking what type of a
[SPEAKER_02]: guy would I be like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the dude you've got to,
you've got to be alarm bells.
[SPEAKER_02]: That dude comes and rolls you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, you've, you've been, obviously
you've got a great selection of strains at
[SPEAKER_03]: home and have over the years produced some
beautiful cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and you know, have done some
traveling.
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what are your, what are the things
that you look for in like a really good
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke?
[SPEAKER_03]: Java Java, like a top three strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a top one, even can you nail it down?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite strain is the blue Magoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, anyone who likes blueberry
strains, they'll really love the blue
[SPEAKER_02]: Magoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to dynasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The BX too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good in seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I love it because it's, it's a very
Indica Afghani type plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's got much better side
branching than the typical Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from a growing point of view,
it yields a lot better than a typical
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani, which is like really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's got like bang on blueberry
turps, but it's got like this kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: musky incense twist to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to describe, but it's,
it's a very like complex and nuanced,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you can just sit there and just kind
of decipher all the components.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, it's like a cave you
explore, you know, there's so much to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, and finally it's, um, it's so
medicinal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just, you smoke it and you feel
like in between all your joints,
[SPEAKER_02]: like little clouds of air and you can feel
the anti-inflammatory properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also really good for anxiety and,
um, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's, um, just as a little side
note as well with that smell, it's like a
[SPEAKER_02]: very feminine smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like a real, it doesn't overpower
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you had it in a bag with something
else, it might even get overpowered
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's, yeah, it's like,
it's got like a soft, almost like the way
[SPEAKER_02]: like lavender has got this softness to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it come from blue dream?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that in its?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it comes from blueberry and across to
a strain called major league bud,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is, um, a very old school strain of
Williams wonder from SSSC, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially the best seed bank of all
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, definitely some heavyweight
genetics behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you know, what's really
interesting, cause I thought about this
[SPEAKER_02]: for a while and I wanted to make a point
of mentioning this, if I ever brought this
[SPEAKER_02]: up was, um, the, the, the Magoo is part of
the reason as to why I share clones with
[SPEAKER_02]: people, because I, you know, like I don't
give them 21, but I share them with
[SPEAKER_02]: friends for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the reason for that is because,
uh, the blue Magoo, they don't know who
[SPEAKER_02]: made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just made by someone in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a real popular in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it's, it, it's a result of
basically because DJ short, the guy who
[SPEAKER_02]: invented blueberry, he decided to release
clones to the community and to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and as a result, you know,
like my favorite strain was essentially
[SPEAKER_02]: conceived by just some dude in a basement
because DJ short was willing to give out
[SPEAKER_02]: his really good cuts of blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for me, that really was like,
well, I'm, I'm going to make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, like I'm not giving it out
to everyone to the point where it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: valueless, but I'm not, I'm not going to
say no to people who are worthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, that's something which I
always consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think people should consider as
well, because, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I mean, likewise, DJ short would
never, he probably wouldn't even really
[SPEAKER_02]: know that much about the strain,
to be honest, but he would never take
[SPEAKER_02]: credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, it's a really, you're just
helping other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's no skin off your back really.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that side of the whole,
the whole breeding thing and the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: sharing and the community that you guys
have.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really nice thing to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It reminds me a lot of the jujitsu
community in a lot of ways.
It's
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So somebody just quickly mentioned was,
in regards to the cut, like one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: goals is to obviously, you know,
have an event next year, which would be
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to tie it back to like that,
that growth of the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so another thing, which unfortunately
I've got no control over, or no one really
[SPEAKER_02]: does, except for just people collectively
is I'd really like for there to be organic
[SPEAKER_02]: networking at the end of the comp,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I mean by that is part of it is
like, so that people kind of know who's
[SPEAKER_02]: who.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think, Hey, I'm trying real
hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm at the forefront of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to know other people who are here
with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you kind of now know, you might have
thought you were going to get first place
[SPEAKER_02]: and you end up getting third place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you got two new best friends,
whoever came second and first.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, and, and that, that again ties
into kind of the, the Magoo point.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that, you know, like through that
networking, people share clones and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, like my ultimate goal in some
regards, people always ask me like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's my ultimate goal?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really have one, but one thing I
would love to achieve is for there to be
[SPEAKER_02]: like a clone sharing scene in Australia,
because that's, that's how shit happens
[SPEAKER_02]: because like so many strains are a result
of just accidents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just because like, there was a,
like a really nice female clone in that
[SPEAKER_02]: grow room at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, as a result of that,
well there's now a new strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think it's really important
that people do that, but there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so many issues surrounding that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the first thing is like,
I, this is like kind of a little how-to of
[SPEAKER_02]: how to trade clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, first of all, don't ever accept
the clone off someone unless you are
[SPEAKER_02]: either a 100% sure that the clone they
have is just better than like anything
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got, anything you've ever tried,
because so many times I've accepted
[SPEAKER_02]: clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just don't perform up to what I'm
expecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that comes back to exposure,
you know, like what you think is really
[SPEAKER_02]: good and you tell me it's really good,
could be totally different to what I think
[SPEAKER_02]: is really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just because I've smoked Chem
91.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I'll ever smoke stronger
weed than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to me, when you give something a
nine out of 10, to me, it might just be a
[SPEAKER_02]: seven out of 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's an important point
because that can lead to frictions and
[SPEAKER_02]: especially it can lead to like,
you, maybe you do a trade with someone and
[SPEAKER_02]: like you're both happy with the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden you feel ripped
off and like they, they weren't trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: rip you off necessarily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so yeah, like you just want to avoid
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really a simple way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you just trade some bud first,
be like, I'll send you some bud of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You send me some bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we both like the bud, we can then
trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so the kind of the unsaid part
of that though is how do you then,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, have good, good weed trade?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you've got to be buying seeds
regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I often, sorry, I feel like it's almost
wasted time when I'm not growing out new
[SPEAKER_02]: strains because sometimes you find a
strain and it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you, maybe you're going to spend a
little bit of time working with that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but honestly it's still just so,
so rewarding to pop new seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: to find new things and to be able to share
them as opposed to just growing the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because to me, I look at it like at the
end of each growing cycle, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got two choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can either grow to make money,
you know, by like selling the bud or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, or you can grow to have new
clones at the end of it, because you've,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you've tested new things and
you've culled out the runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now at the end of it, or you've got
maybe, let's say, you know, you did a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole room full of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now at the end of it, you've maybe
got two or three plants that are like
[SPEAKER_02]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, I've got them in your
kit, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, you've got a choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do those.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, I'm not interested in the money
one, you know, I'm interested in finding
[SPEAKER_02]: the new clones because hey, the clones are
worth a lot more and they're an infinite
[SPEAKER_02]: source of the bud as opposed to just a
finite one, which will get you money,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then it's gone and you've got to make
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more so, it opens the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: If no one pops seeds, that's just a shame
because then we've got no new flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you really do need to constantly have
new strains coming onto the scene because
[SPEAKER_02]: A, it gets people interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more importantly, I'm sure as you're
aware, when you're like, and this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: hard point to explain, you know,
cause by definition, a heavy smoker is
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone who smokes once a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like for, for like people like us,
that doesn't sound like a heavy smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if someone came up to me and was
like, Oh, you know, I just have like one,
[SPEAKER_02]: one hit before bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I wouldn't call him a heavy smoker at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be like, you're a light smoker,
but that's a heavy smoker by medical
[SPEAKER_02]: definition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and you do notice, even if you
smoke that much, if you suddenly switch
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, you'll feel like you've just been
hit for six, you know, and that's because
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the change in cannabinoid profile is
like a shock to the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it almost feels like you had a bit of
a tolerance break in the sense of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just, it's hitting you harder than
the previous strain was until you readjust
[SPEAKER_02]: to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if nothing else, you know,
there's people might need to take meds
[SPEAKER_02]: every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like for them to be able to have
something which can just totally feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: a shock to the system, even though they
haven't gone on a tolerance break.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from a recreational point of view,
it's always nice to have new flavors or to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to feel like a different type of
euphoria, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, that's always the joy of
being able to get overseas to places where
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got access to the various strains
and you don't even have to buy lots of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and you can just, it's,
then you get a real good appreciation of
[SPEAKER_03]: how varying and subtle the different
effects of different strains can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something which I think it's
like, it's that whole exposure point,
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like if people knew about the
different ways they could feel,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I was so much more passionate
about things like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time I had some banana ROG and every
time you took a hit from this stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd get like a wave of kind of tingles
slash euphoria go through your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure everyone's experienced that
from smoking weed at some point in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the crazy part was like every time you
took a hit of this stuff without fail,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, like this is, there's
clearly, you know, like a specific
[SPEAKER_02]: composition of chemicals in this weed
right now, which is doing, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and what people haven't probably
haven't realized is that, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I only like smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been a couple of times I enjoyed
it, but I never did the other times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not knowing that those couple of times I
enjoyed it, there's a specific strain out
[SPEAKER_03]: there for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to replicate that every time
for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think exposure is a big one and
that'll be good because just over time
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll naturally happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, yeah, a little side note
of what I was mentioning before in regards
[SPEAKER_02]: to the popping seeds, you also really need
to keep the clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know a lot of people who grow
seeds out, but like they don't keep
[SPEAKER_02]: clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just such a waste, you know,
like you're seriously wasting the genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you found the best strain on earth,
it's now gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, go on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you, if you keep a clone and you
propagate a mother plant, she's viable for
[SPEAKER_03]: a long time, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Theoretically forever, as long as you
don't treat it bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like people, it's just,
it seems like a bunch of effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was something I went through
myself and I realized every time I kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: up the ante as a grower or as a breeder,
it then just became the new norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was like, Oh, you mean I've got to
take cuttings of every plant before
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then soon enough that was the norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was like, Oh, well,
I've got to keep cuttings with the males
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you kidding?
[SPEAKER_02]: And just now that's the norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, it's just adjusting and
getting used to it because some people
[SPEAKER_02]: will be like, Oh, well if the plant's
really good, I can just revedge it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to take a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is when you revedge a plant
often that plant will now be reduced
[SPEAKER_02]: potency and reduce yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, you might have it back,
but it's like often it's not the same
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, not as good, I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, it's worth the effort to take
time to keep the clones because there's
[SPEAKER_02]: probably been more good strains lost even
in just Australia than like there are
[SPEAKER_02]: clone onlys in America, so to speak,
because lots of people in Australia buy
[SPEAKER_02]: good quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they just grow it out and
they're like, yeah, that was like an
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome three or four ounces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you pop a bunch of seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what your feelings are on
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that kind of the way people go or is
that not a thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as I thought you kind of still a
bit risky with playing with the genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: further down the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, to me, honestly, I've grown a lot of
feminized seeds out and I've never really
[SPEAKER_02]: had major issues with hermaphrodism,
except from the calicon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep that in mind everyone, calicon is
hermy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, some of them don't,
but most of them do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically in general, yeah,
my feminized seeds have never hermied on
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I speak to people, that tends to
not be their issue with feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: either.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tends to be when people want to breed
with feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's actually because it's like as a
breeder, you should be going to the effort
[SPEAKER_02]: of doing all the things that need to be
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're a breeder, feminized seeds
is a bit of a shortcut because it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, I don't have to bother, you know,
culling out the males.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, I can select through 30 plants
instead of 15 because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, if you're just growing out
for yourself, go for feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great way to, especially because,
you know, you don't have to like fuck with
[SPEAKER_02]: culling the males.
[SPEAKER_02]: As if it's your first time around and you
don't want to have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, that's, that's what I was
going to kind of ask about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you, if you don't know what you've
got, right, they're not feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got, say you've got 10 plants
growing, you would advise or you would
[SPEAKER_03]: take cuttings of the 10 of those before
they showed any signs of sex or what they
[SPEAKER_03]: were going to be and have them all clearly
labeled and marked and then make your
[SPEAKER_03]: decisions after the flowering point and
refer back to those previous cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically yes to everything you said,
except I sex them first.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I find out what are the males and the
females, and then I take cuttings of all
[SPEAKER_02]: the females.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I was going to breed with the
males, I would select my male out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: group and then take a cutting of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then cull all the males.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then I'd have a cutting of all the
females plus the one male plus big parents
[SPEAKER_02]: of all those ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd put the big ones into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, little ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause some often a lot of sites will tell
you to keep the big plant as a mother and
[SPEAKER_02]: then grow the little one up and flower
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, no, that's totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put the big plant into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause otherwise it will get way too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what the fuck are you going to do
with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big one into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the little one, once it's rooted
and cloned, that's your new mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tiny and easy to maintain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and then in sexing before you
determine clones, is there tips and tricks
[SPEAKER_03]: to sexing males and females?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously every new time grower is
worried about, you know, having their
[SPEAKER_03]: females pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody trips out that they don't
want to get their boys out before there's
[SPEAKER_03]: any problem of them releasing pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some tips and tricks for you as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're feeling confident,
what you do is you let the plants get root
[SPEAKER_02]: bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by that, what I mean is you put
them into little pots after you've
[SPEAKER_02]: sprouted them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by little, I don't mean crazy small.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like, you know, relatively small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it may be like a half a liter up to
a one liter pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't go higher than one liter
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically you let the plant grow in
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically that's the only pot it'll
ever be in before it goes into the final
[SPEAKER_02]: pot, which you'll then basically you'll
transplant into that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes into flower by leaving it
in that small pot and letting it get root
[SPEAKER_02]: bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant like it's a little bit stressed,
but we're in veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stress doesn't mean anything in veg
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it gets root bound, gets a bit
stressed and it'll show sex early.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing I do in conjunction with
that, which is a little bit easier to do
[SPEAKER_02]: because most people, when they grow in
their first time, it's probably easier for
[SPEAKER_02]: them to just have the plant in like an
appropriate pot because towards the end,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you've got like a big plant in a
small pot, it becomes a little bit harder
[SPEAKER_02]: to maintain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're not feeling real confident
with that one, the other one, which I
[SPEAKER_02]: would recommend, or you can do them
together is keep the plant on the 24 hour
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under the 24 hour light, the plant won't
grow as quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll have smaller internodal distance,
but it'll be very sensitive to darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you say grow it up to say five nodes
big, it's got five nodes and it's under 24
[SPEAKER_02]: hour lights and you then start to give it
eight hours of, sorry, six hours of
[SPEAKER_02]: darkness, which is not enough to make it
flower, but it's a lot of darkness in
[SPEAKER_02]: comparison to getting none.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants will almost like start to
prepare for flower and they'll start to
[SPEAKER_02]: show their sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so either one of those or both
together works really well and that way
[SPEAKER_02]: you can find out the sex before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And either one of those, sorry to
interrupt, but on either one of those,
[SPEAKER_03]: would you then, after doing either one
root bound or whatever, would you then
[SPEAKER_03]: move it fully into its flower cycle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once it got root bound and showed sex,
it would be about a reasonable height
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would then replant it as soon as it
showed sex.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was enough growth on it to take a
clone then and there, I'd do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I know it's a female.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, as you said, put it in the final
pot, maybe give it a week or so before you
[SPEAKER_02]: flip it to flower so it can just kind of
establish itself and it'll grow a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, then you'll be able to get a
nice healthy clone off it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can still take clones relatively
safely up until the end of the first week
[SPEAKER_02]: of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you have to give it a bit
longer, you could do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one caveat I'll put on that is if
that clone doesn't root, you won't know
[SPEAKER_02]: till about, it takes about two weeks for a
clone to really show you whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to root or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if after about two weeks, if your
conditions are good and it hasn't rooted,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's probably not going to root.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that point you'd be in week three of
flower and now it's too late to take a
[SPEAKER_02]: clone in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a bit risky doing it,
but you can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess, well, you just want to take
enough clones initially so that your
[SPEAKER_03]: success rate in the rooting is increased,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a bit paranoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still take like two or three clones of
everything because I'm, I feel if I took
[SPEAKER_02]: one and it just didn't, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you just don't, you don't have a
spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course the one time I only cut one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happened to me once and I lost my
most beloved plant literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Less learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took three clones and none of them
rooted.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should be doing four or five.
[SPEAKER_03]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, especially like in the climate that
we live in with the illegalities involved,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the reward understandably has to
be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that doesn't mean that our growers have
to grow lots of crappy weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's let them grow less really good weed
and pay like what it's due.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you also need to not,
not abuse the medical side of things in
[SPEAKER_02]: the sense that I know so many people and
they eventually someone will like start
[SPEAKER_02]: throwing the term medicine around and,
and then using that as almost like a form
[SPEAKER_02]: of like, I need this for cheaper because
it's, it's one thing to be like giving
[SPEAKER_02]: someone some, you know, weed or if you
want to call it medicine in this sense at
[SPEAKER_02]: a discounted rate, because like you feel
like they really need it and they can't
[SPEAKER_02]: afford it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's another thing for like what I
hear about, which is mostly people who
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of start to throw the term
around and be like, oh, and then use that
[SPEAKER_02]: as like a segue into like, can you hear
that cop car?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like right out front of my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an ammo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people use that as a segue to try to,
you know, get stuff for cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I literally got told two
days ago by a grower I know who grows,
[SPEAKER_02]: he grows really good organic stuff and he
gives it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super cheap in my opinion, like crazy
cheap, like, like he's barely,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's probably just covering his
bare minimums.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was saying like, yeah, like he was
giving this girl like one ounce a month
[SPEAKER_02]: and then all of a sudden she needs two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, he, he like agreed to
do it at first, but then he just realized
[SPEAKER_02]: that like, you know, she would then just
go and sell it to a friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, you know, just willing to pay
like good prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like, yeah, that's kind of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a shame.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's always going to be people
out there looking to rip you off wherever
[SPEAKER_03]: they can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I mean, some of, some of the,
the rest of us kind of have to prop it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a shame.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I guess one thing I was thinking
about, cause I actually, I, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was around at a friend's house today
and, uh, the, um, can a koala and the Oz
[SPEAKER_03]: can a lady, I don't know if you're aware
of those guys from Instagram were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, they're, they're bringing,
it's going to start bringing in some CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: isolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, hemp produce isolate.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is it, is it any different from
CBD isolate that would be produced from a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly haven't read enough into it,
but from the briefings I have read,
[SPEAKER_02]: it seems to suggest that, um, CBD derived
from cannabis would be much better because
[SPEAKER_02]: assuming you're not talking about like
99%, like, you know, like, like stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like crystal meth, basically,
because, um, you know, at that point it's
[SPEAKER_02]: all the same, you know, it really doesn't
even matter where it's come from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 99% CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if it's like some kind of extract,
like a dab type thing, I think from a
[SPEAKER_02]: plant would be way better because we know
that the, uh, you know, all the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the other components of their plants,
such as, you know, the flavonoids and the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, all of these things synergize
with the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it, it makes sense that, you know,
a THC based weed, which has got the right
[SPEAKER_02]: THC, uh, the right cannabinoid profile and
flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'd be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, um, who is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD crew, the good ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like, there's like CBD crew and
CBD seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them was like a fucking joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them was like shanty barber.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one's like legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys offer a strain called CBD
divine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's apparently like the first strain
that's derived from a cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: not, not hemp that had like 0% THC and
like 16% CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got like, and it looks like a
cannabis plant and it's like, apparently
[SPEAKER_02]: got pretty good turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could imagine that the extract would
be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I smoked some really nice,
well, there were the two CBD strains at
[SPEAKER_03]: the farm last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some Swiss and maybe it was,
I can't remember a spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a spider web, which was like
something from, from Charlotte's web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, they were, they were
delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them had a super low CBD,
super low THC and one had a kind of higher
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD and medium THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were, they were really lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the taste, the smell profile were
absolutely delicious, but the buds
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves were like, were considerably
different to like normal cannabis buds
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that they kind of, they didn't have as
much structure to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: That could have been a part of the grow as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've got a one-to-one CBD strain I
grow, but it looks like regular weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think it's one-to-one level.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably would.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't really seen what the end product
of what they're making this, the hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: extractions look like, like whether
there's any appreciable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there'd probably be a few calyxes
like individually stacked on top of each
[SPEAKER_02]: other, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, this is a quick note.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still wasn't aware that you were able to
import CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought there was still some weird like
little restriction about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as far as I, I, I think,
because I think it's still technically
[SPEAKER_02]: classified as a poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the way they do it,
where it's like, cause it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get prescribed a poison because
pretty much every drug is listed as a
[SPEAKER_02]: poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't import poisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't wondering if, and this is with no
research backing it up, but if it wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: to do with the change from the foods for
Australia and New Zealand reclassifying
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp, I don't know if that changed some of
the availability.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's all hemp derived.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in the sense that, yeah,
that actually probably works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that you might have to derive
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might have to make it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you just, just press it here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's going to, it's, if that's the
case, like if that is the work around that
[SPEAKER_03]: now that hemp is, you can consume it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you can start to make hemp based
extraction things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's going to be, it's going to be
interesting to see what happens in terms
[SPEAKER_03]: of that market here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I don't know if it'll be game changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it'd be game changing
for like, you know, epileptic kids and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I always have to remind people
that the reason why I grow a one to one
[SPEAKER_02]: strain is because as far as we can see,
um, one to one seems to be arguably the
[SPEAKER_02]: most therapeutic ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason for that is because if you
look at all the different symptoms and
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrums of disorders that cannabis
treats, it appears that THC tends to treat
[SPEAKER_02]: the large majority of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's only actually a very small amount
that are exclusively treated by CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that means is there's only a small
amount of diseases where you absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: need CBD, but the largest amount of them
actually benefit from having both THC and
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, the real epileptic kids,
those are one of the ones who exclusively
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit from the CBD, but most people,
I think they actually don't get benefits
[SPEAKER_02]: for most.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure like the glaucoma people,
for example, like you actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need the THC, um, more so than the CBD
in that case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think even in, in some of the cases
of kids with, um, with epilepsy and things
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, I think further into their
treatment, like years down the line,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're finding that they're having to up
the THC a little bit as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I think that they're, it's really
synergistic together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so yeah, that's something which,
and that, that plays into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, like in my opinion,
I'm really, really quite skeptical of the
[SPEAKER_02]: current medical scene we have,
because it's, it's like a, it seems like a
[SPEAKER_02]: big farce to me, you know, it's scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and I'm, I'm literally counting
on the, you know, I guess the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to speak to increase the penalties on
growing after the whole scheme's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: fully rolled out, so to speak in that
they'll do exactly like what they did in
[SPEAKER_02]: America where they'll say anyone who needs
it now has access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone else is still growing is just a
criminal and even worse criminal
[SPEAKER_03]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just doing it for the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, in my opinion, like you've really
got to be steadfast in the right to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: your own has to be like the number one
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you don't have the right to grow
up for yourself, I just, I don't think I
[SPEAKER_02]: would compromise for that because even in,
even in the States, you know, we can both
[SPEAKER_02]: attest to this, even in a mark,
even in a place where you can grow
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself, there's still so much issues
with, you know, it not being grown
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly, like in like a medical sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, if it was exclusively up
to like Marlboro or whatever, what hope in
[SPEAKER_02]: hell do you have that they give a shit
about your health?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's, it's pretty crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I still just get blown away at like
how our laws are shaping up here,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think we're going to have to go
through like a, a kind of a dark period
[SPEAKER_03]: where it's going to be kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be mad controlled before
actual decriminalization and recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: use comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's going to, I think that,
I think we're in store for like a few
[SPEAKER_03]: years of bizarre, crappy, weird reform
after reform of bizarre cannabis law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and I mean, I think I would probably
agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the interesting part about it is like
how we referenced earlier, there's almost
[SPEAKER_02]: like two sides to the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like the political side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's just the actual kind of
underground production side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that we could, for example,
as a whole community, just as a
[SPEAKER_02]: hypothetical be like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's going to try to be active in
campaigning for law change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, everyone's just going to try to
focus on growing the dankest weed
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And all you could do the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, neither one of those would
be, I mean, I think the first situation
[SPEAKER_02]: would probably be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, like it's really illegal
and you've got good weed as opposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: having it legal, but everyone's just
smoking PGRs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my mind, it's like, well,
I accept that there's that political
[SPEAKER_02]: instability, which essentially means like,
you know, all your work could be for
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, that's why I think it's
like, you've got to push that other end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the coin so hard because it's,
what if it's just like the other way
[SPEAKER_02]: around where it's like, we get to the
point where weed is so dank and everyone's
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking dank weed that it's just like,
fuck, this needs to be legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and so, you know, that's what might
be the, what pushes it over in the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I think it would be a lot more
complex and I think a big thing would be
[SPEAKER_02]: labor getting empowered, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but even then, you know, like that's,
that's just like a minor point,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think, yeah, like I've always
thought that and that's a part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: reason why I breed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's like, I just thought,
yeah, like if everyone could smoke dank
[SPEAKER_02]: weed, hopefully they would then have the
knowledge and the willpower to say no to
[SPEAKER_02]: PGRs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's like, Hey, you get it out
and you can also get good flavors into the
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's an interesting one,
but yeah, you got to push that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the point always, I mean, Australia's
still caught up with some really bad
[SPEAKER_03]: preconceived notions of, of weed smokers
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that it's still got a really bad
rap that they managed to be down in a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of parts of the U S you know, that whole
reefer madness.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really sunk in, in like, in my parents'
generation, you know, it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's pretty hardcore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas in the States, you see people of
my parents' generation, even later in
[SPEAKER_03]: life, I mean, California is different,
but you're starting to see it around the,
[SPEAKER_03]: all around America now where people later
in life are starting to really break down
[SPEAKER_03]: their preconceived notions about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, it's just, I just feel like it's a
bit of a weird statement to make,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I feel like on the whole, the older
generation of Australia are more
[SPEAKER_02]: conservative than the older generation in
America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, on the outlying end of the
spectrum, definitely not, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's definitely some really fucking
conservative outliers in America,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if you look at the general masses and
so, yeah, it's really one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: problems where it's like, you hate to say,
but it's like, we just need the old people
[SPEAKER_02]: to die off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, obviously not literally,
but in the sense that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we will see that, we'll see that change
come in, that generational change coming
[SPEAKER_03]: in our life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's, it's, that's like 20,
25 years away though, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so hopefully that's not how far away
cannabis reform is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'll be like a trickle down thing
where like, you'll see one person in
[SPEAKER_02]: parliament start to really support it and
then, you know, and then it just starts to
[SPEAKER_02]: trickle onwards and the others lose their
numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, you know, typically how it's
happened around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and it's playing out all around the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, they could surprise me and
it could really happen quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I reckon we can call that a podcast
and a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice and short one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thank you to my homies at the
Herbalize podcast, as well as all of their
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: To our sponsors, 420 Australia and Organic
Gardening Solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to everyone for listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you.
[SPEAKER_00]: La la la la la la.
Bye.
