[SPEAKER_00]: historians of the scene on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big welcome to the editor of the Emperor
Wears No Clothes, as well as the man
[SPEAKER_00]: behind AG Seedcode, Todd McCormick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, first question we love to ask
our guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you smoking on at the moment?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually a haze combination.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of the original older
genetics and I really love original haze
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've kind of crossed it with
everything I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is one of those concoctions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an on haze, which is an old Neville's
haze that I used.
[SPEAKER_03]: I crossed it against an original haze male
and I made something called on haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I took that and I've crossed this
with something called super glue,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was like an Afghan Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some ways, I was trying to recreate
that old NL5 haze that we all used to love
[SPEAKER_03]: so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, how do you feel this one
compares to the old NL5 haze?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different, you know, because every
phenotype we pick are different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if the plants are brothers and sister
seeds, you can still get a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: variation between them, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can have one brother or one
sister who's kind of overweight,
[SPEAKER_03]: another one that's really skinny,
another one that's super smart,
[SPEAKER_03]: another one that can't do math.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like that with plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: The original haze is really the smell and
the taste that defines haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everything else is like crudy or
gassy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That leathery kind of Afghan, stinky,
skunky smell, we call it in North America
[SPEAKER_03]: is very different from the terpenes that
you find in that Colombian original haze
[SPEAKER_03]: mixture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's truly unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really like it, however it comes out,
because I just favor the scent and the
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, lovely, lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you find incorporating some of
those more modern genetics brings a little
[SPEAKER_00]: something extra to the table or it maybe
just takes it a little different place,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's kind of the other way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Around because original haze is really the
first hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a first bred in the Santa Cruz
mountains over here near where I live back
[SPEAKER_03]: in 1969.
[SPEAKER_03]: Came along around five, six years before
skunk one, which is what I would call the
[SPEAKER_03]: second real hybrid that that was bred and
then became kind of famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And later on, when I first got exposed to
haze, it was in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: I visited the cannabis castle in 1994 with
Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was standing next to Jack when Ben
Drunkers gave the Jack Herrera variety its
[SPEAKER_03]: name and christened it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was able to smoke some of the
Northern Lights and the haze crosses that
[SPEAKER_03]: were at the castle at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also lived in Amsterdam for over a year
after that and visited numerous times
[SPEAKER_03]: after this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it really was different for me because
I had been growing for 10 years at that
[SPEAKER_03]: time, but I'd never experienced haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was just, it was a wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had never experienced cannabis that
gave me like a coffee, a morning coffee
[SPEAKER_03]: effect where I felt like invigorated and
talkative and engaged.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was usually a lot of the varieties of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was more like, you know, you relax,
you nod out, you know, you're in your own
[SPEAKER_03]: little world, but not so much with haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was really intrigued and it took me
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked up seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew Northern Lights number five by
haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew the Jack Herrera seeds that they
gave Jack at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I still had them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I lived in Holland, I was able to
get a really nice Northern Lights number
[SPEAKER_03]: five clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was technically the plant that won the
1996 cannabis cup as a dirt grown pop,
[SPEAKER_03]: as a hydroponically grown pop,
but it was really dirt grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was truly exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then years and years go by,
2012, I was in Amsterdam receiving the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis culture award along with Dr.
Lester Grinspoon and Sir Richard Branson
[SPEAKER_03]: of all places.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Skunkman Sam came to the event and I
used the opportunity to ask him and I'd
[SPEAKER_03]: known him since 94.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually was very silly and was like,
Hey, will you sell me the original haze
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds that you sold Neville?
[SPEAKER_03]: And after he got finished laughing at me,
he told me that he'd consider it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he asked me what else I wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt like a dummy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, I was like, you know,
I don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says, I think you want all the
seeds I saved for myself and I don't sell
[SPEAKER_03]: to anybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Oh, that's exactly the
seeds I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, bring over your best hash and
come over and we'll talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went over there and it was really a
wonderful experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Skunkman Sam is credited with
saving original haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: His home was next to the gentleman who I
only noticed the letter G, who was the
[SPEAKER_03]: surfer who first bred haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were neighbors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy down the street was his two
initials were RL.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went on to make the 1976 original haze
poster that became really famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also the other neighbor they had down
the street was the guy that wrote the
[SPEAKER_03]: psychedelic encyclopedia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was quite the block over there back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he, Skunkman Sam, realized that the
original haze was a unique cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he saved it by not losing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most breeders cross what they have with
what they've got and they make new
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties and they think they're improving
it, but they get further and further and
[SPEAKER_03]: further from that original creation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not always for the better,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what Sam did, which was unique,
is he kept it through IVL breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is only allowing the males and
females from that particular variety to
[SPEAKER_03]: breed with each other so that he could
capture those genetics and work with them
[SPEAKER_03]: as the generations passed.
[SPEAKER_03]: He took selected plants and he created
varieties like Skunk by Haze, by Tai.
[SPEAKER_03]: He calls that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then he has a whole shitload of them in
all reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like a fool listing them all off.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what he did is he gave me the original
haze seeds and then he gave me all of his
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite out-crosses with it, which was
really quite beautiful because think of it
[SPEAKER_03]: like colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like getting a primary color and then
all his favorite secondary colors and you
[SPEAKER_03]: can go home and do art.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was really happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I realized this, I realized that
I had brother and sister seeds of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants that Neville had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Neville had two male haze plants that
he used to breed with everything that's
[SPEAKER_03]: quite famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a haze hay and a haze seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those two plants came originally through
Skunk Man Sam and the seeds that he gave
[SPEAKER_03]: me were essentially brothers and sisters
to those males.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I got home, I took a cutting I had
of Neville's haze and then back crossed
[SPEAKER_03]: it, if you will, to a male original haze
plant because I wanted to turn up the
[SPEAKER_03]: haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted more haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what made Neville's haze unique to
original haze is that touch of Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights, which was a little bit of Afghan
that it had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the recipe for Neville's haze was
Northern Lights Number 5 by Haze,
[SPEAKER_03]: Haze C, I think, crossed back to Haze A,
which was his other, or not crossed back
[SPEAKER_03]: to, but crossed out to his other Haze A.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was what he called Neville's
haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he took that plant later on and
crossed it with Skunk One and called that
[SPEAKER_03]: Super Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that little bit of Northern Lights
really is something that I always just
[SPEAKER_03]: loved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the time, I didn't have original
Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had things like OG Kush and Super
Glue, which are very reminiscent in all
[SPEAKER_03]: reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I was doing is trying to recreate
what I had with some of these generic
[SPEAKER_03]: because going back to Skunk Man Sam is
like going back to the original source.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the guy that initially sold the seeds
to Neville in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's really the genius behind Skunk
One and quite a few other varieties,
[SPEAKER_03]: even hemp varieties such as Phenola.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just really quite incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the breadth of his work is
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, on a personal curiosity,
how did your haze back cross end up
[SPEAKER_00]: turning out for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I love Ang Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've used it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2019, I used the male from that variety
that I created.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I crossed it against most of these
clone-only cultivars floating around
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when I was working with it,
I was realizing that when you're breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: with cannabis, a lot of times the female
is more dominant in the prodigy than the
[SPEAKER_03]: male.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was able to kind of use my Ang Haze
as almost like a neon filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no real color neon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you take red, blue,
green, and you want to make it neon,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's still red, blue, green.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I wanted to do with a lot of
these clone-only cultivars such as Green
[SPEAKER_03]: Crack and OG Kush and Trainwreck and
others is I wanted to retain that red,
[SPEAKER_03]: blue, green.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wanted to add a little bit of
spiciness to it, which was on Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: And happy 420 from California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always stop at 420 in light of joy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And take a little breath and take a little
moment of meditation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as twist of fate would have it,
after Neville passed away, I wrote an
[SPEAKER_03]: article called Legacy of a Legend.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he most certainly was a legend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got this comment from a guy named
Greg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he alluded to Northern Lights living
on through Neville's work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I knew Greg's name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew that the guy that supposedly
brought Northern Lights to Neville was
[SPEAKER_03]: named Greg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that he was from Seattle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've heard the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I couldn't imagine he was commenting
on my post.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I messaged him and said hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tried to introduce myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just said, Todd, I've been
following you since the 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know exactly who you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why I'm following your Facebook
page.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we started talking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he told me that he always wanted to
get original skunk one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he always wanted original Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he couldn't get them through Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, unfortunately, him and Neville
had a falling out, I'd say about a year
[SPEAKER_03]: and a half after they started doing
business, you could say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville kind of went behind his back,
tried to buy some of the seeds from
[SPEAKER_03]: another party.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interesting because I am a
collector of books about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have all the old Neville catalogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's actually a paragraph in one of
the pre-catalog letters that he wrote
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, bad news, my Northern Lights
supplier has cut off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just stunned me a little to get it
from Greg and what had happened and why
[SPEAKER_03]: that happened, why he got cut off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the time, I sent Greg over the
original Haze and skunk just to be
[SPEAKER_03]: courteous.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a legend.
[SPEAKER_03]: He deserves it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let him enjoy these genetics for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then about maybe a year plus later,
almost two, we had been staying in
[SPEAKER_03]: contact.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he called me and said,
hey, my sister passed away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, wow, I'm really sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But not why I'm calling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted your address.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to return the favor.
[SPEAKER_03]: My family found some of my old Northern
Lights seeds in one of her freezers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're from the early 80s from even
before I met Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm getting germination out of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to see what you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I sent him my address.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he sent me Northern Lights number two.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent me Northern Lights number five.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent me what is called Purest Indica,
which is the Afghan that he got from this
[SPEAKER_03]: gentleman named Murphy Stevens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, Murphy Stevens, wrote a book
called How to Grow Marijuana Indoors Under
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights, one of the best cannabis
cultivation books.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I literally have every cannabis
cultivation book from the 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really quite incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: He explains cloning.
[SPEAKER_03]: He explains CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: He explains some of the things that have
become mainstay, like taking mothers and
[SPEAKER_03]: doing selections in our work of today,
but was kind of unheard of back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were friends because of this
indoor sun shop, it was called.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he'd go in there and buy equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess, Steve Murphy, Murphy Stevens
was his pen name, but his real name was
[SPEAKER_03]: the other way around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve Murphy gave Greg some of these
Afghan seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave him four of them in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is what became the Northern
Lights lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, so what he did is he,
Greg F2-ed them, which would be to mix the
[SPEAKER_03]: brothers and sister seeds together and
made a whole bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he called that Purest Indica because
that was the one he got from Murphy
[SPEAKER_03]: Stevens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what he started to do is
out-cross it to other Afghans that he got
[SPEAKER_03]: from Oregon and California, and then more
tropical plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I asked him, what the numbers
represented when he sent them to Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, the numbers were one through
like 11 or 12 were based on how close they
[SPEAKER_03]: were to that Purest Indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, one being like, Purest Indica
would more be like zero, because if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: counting, it would be like, oh,
comes first, Purest Indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: First hybrid is number one, second hybrid
is number two, third, fourth, and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like number five, he told me, was actually
crossed with what at the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: they thought was a Hawaiian, but he has
always believed was a Northern Mexican
[SPEAKER_03]: variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a little more tropical.
[SPEAKER_03]: So each of the plant numbers became more
tropical and truly fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, from my perspective as a historian
and just an overall cannabis geek,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I started growing in 1984 and I
was reading High Times back then,
[SPEAKER_03]: like we all were.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know, it just like a little
boy's dream to now be in communication
[SPEAKER_03]: with this guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he's in his seventies,
a retired Marine.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's, you know, just incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I started growing them out and I
have these old books and I have these old
[SPEAKER_03]: photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And later on, I'll send you some pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's truly remarkable because it looks
exactly like the first page in Murphy,
[SPEAKER_03]: in Murphy Stevens book.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just blows, blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's been really wild to now have
these original Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm starting to play with those
and the original haze and the original
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's quite the palette.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were thinking of it, like,
like art, it's, it's quite the color
[SPEAKER_03]: palette to start with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I actually have more of these original
colors than even was given to Neville at
[SPEAKER_03]: the time, because Neville never received
all of Skunkman Sam's favorite out-crosses
[SPEAKER_03]: with haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: He never received a batch of original haze
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: He only got a couple of males.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was unable to do what I did,
which was reproduce as an F2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or an IBL original haze and basically
unlock it and share the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had to actually use them as hybrids,
which started appearing in the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Holland seed bank catalog in 1988.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prior to 88, 85, six, seven, there's not
even the word haze mentioned in any of
[SPEAKER_03]: those catalogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's not even the haze,
the word haze hasn't even mentioned in the
[SPEAKER_03]: super long high times article that was
published in March of 87.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I came to the conclusion that
Neville just didn't have haze at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Greg told me that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I've heard it from other people
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's a real opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's been a lot of,
you know, breeding done in the past 30
[SPEAKER_03]: years plus since the eighties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, I don't think a lot of
it was for the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that a lot of people were breeding
for, for, for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: For fields and, and, and for quickness
rather than overall quality and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, I think we somewhat
lost our way with some of these older
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that I have thick original skunk
one and original haze and original
[SPEAKER_03]: northern lights in various forms,
I am, it's like a time machine to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I was growing back in the eighties
and now to be able to grow these again,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just truly quite remarkable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that was so long winded.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I already have that feeling in the
back of my neck where I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to be a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell really, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A myriad of different avenues we could
choose to go in after you gave me so many
[SPEAKER_00]: good little leads I could pull on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess something I wanted to discuss is
this topic of Neville being a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: disliked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've spoken to a lot of people who
know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most consistent thing I hear is,
he was a bit disliked that he was a
[SPEAKER_00]: complex man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And although undeniably he did some of the
best breeding we've ever seen,
[SPEAKER_00]: he also burnt a lot of bridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess my question is, do you feel
like in a case like Neville, he's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those people where you've got to
separate the art from the artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you ever have any personal
interactions with him?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a beautiful way to put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did have interactions with Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was always nice to me when I met him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I played chess with him once.
[SPEAKER_03]: We smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up around drugs as a kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little biker kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my cousin Kathy died from a heroin
overdose way back in the early nineties
[SPEAKER_03]: before I ever met Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I grew up around people that
unfortunately did abuse alcohol and were
[SPEAKER_03]: flirting with heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you grow up around it as a little
kid, you kind of feel it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't do hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I smoke grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of square in a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than cannabis, we didn't have
what we get high on in common.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, what I respect about
Neville, and I'd like to say up front,
[SPEAKER_03]: is when you read that article back in
1987, he's not a victim.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's never been a victim of his own
circumstance.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't portray himself as a victim.
[SPEAKER_03]: He deals with his addiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: His addiction issues like an adult,
and he's remorseful for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's realistic about trying to struggle to
deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have nothing but empathy for someone
who's dealing with alcohol and drug
[SPEAKER_03]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: People say, well, it's a consensual
disease.
[SPEAKER_03]: You smoke the stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You drink the stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is your fault.
[SPEAKER_03]: But chemically, it gets a little deeper
than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, I believe that his
substance abuse absolutely compromised his
[SPEAKER_03]: personal relationships with a lot of good
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, when I was writing
Legacy of the Legend, I know a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people that knew Neville that was in
business with Neville that were really
[SPEAKER_03]: close to Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of them wanted to say a damn thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunate because is it so much he
burnt the bridges or it was his addictions
[SPEAKER_03]: that caused him to burn the bridges?
[SPEAKER_03]: But he did burn bridges.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've interviewed Skunkman Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've interviewed Greg and Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they told similar stories around the
same time about how Neville ripped them
[SPEAKER_03]: off, knocked off their seeds, went behind
their back, and killed their relationships
[SPEAKER_03]: with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg and Sam don't know each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't meet until recently when I
gave each other their numbers and said,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, you guys, you're both in your 70s.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're both legends.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: But up until now, they never had
communication.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's interesting for me, a journalist,
to hear these unedited versions of events
[SPEAKER_03]: from the people who were really in touch
and have the genetics now and had the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as Neville, and I don't mean to
bash, as someone who grew up in the 80s,
[SPEAKER_03]: he was a hero to me in all reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a rock star, Led Zeppelin,
there was the Holland Seed Bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, though, the more you
get into the history of it, Neville only
[SPEAKER_03]: picked up a Mel Frank grow book in 1981.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was inspired by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he started the Holland Seed Bank,
84.
[SPEAKER_03]: Initially, he started selling seeds he was
collecting from Dutch coffee shops that he
[SPEAKER_03]: hadn't grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he literally had a disclaimer saying,
I can't vouch for these.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't make them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was selling for like 25 cents
each.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his world changed when he met Skunkman
Sam and got that whole catalog that really
[SPEAKER_03]: worked California genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: California Orange, Skunk One, Hindu Kush,
Afghani One, Durban, Poison.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville had anything to do with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And realistically, at the time with the
drug war and everything, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: weren't really stepping up to say,
oh, yeah, that's me that I did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he begot these genetics, 1984,
1985, and kind of took credit for the work
[SPEAKER_03]: of many people that came before him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't believe now in today's
cannabis economy or community that if
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody was growing wheat for two or
three or four years even, let's give him
[SPEAKER_03]: 81, which I understand he wasn't growing
in 81, 82 or 83.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did grow in 84 outside of his apartment
before he got the cannabis castle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: The winter came.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just in the backyard type of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't until he moved into the
castle that they started growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he started getting help from people
that went to the university.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really he had no experience breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a heroin addict who was trying to
get off heroin, got a loan from the
[SPEAKER_03]: government, started selling seeds,
bought seeds that were really good and
[SPEAKER_03]: started mixing them together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want to say, I mean,
it's like these DJs that take really good
[SPEAKER_03]: music from one artist and really good
music from another artist and mash it
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds great on the dance floor,
but they're not musicians, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't write Love Me Do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not making these beats.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just taking somebody else's work
and jingling it together and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: little rock stars on their own merit,
but on their own, they're really not
[SPEAKER_03]: musicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hate to say this, but I don't see
Neville as much of a breeder because he
[SPEAKER_03]: was handed such fantastic varieties and he
crossed them together, mainly because he
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't paying the people for their seeds
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So unfortunately we saw things like skunk
number two and him selling a half price
[SPEAKER_03]: seed and then literally in the catalog,
it says, there was like an unexpected
[SPEAKER_03]: pollination and I'm selling these at half
price.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if Mr. Jack Daniels went to a
distillery and sold them his number seven
[SPEAKER_03]: whiskey recipe, and then a year or so the
distillery realized, you know what,
[SPEAKER_03]: don't need Jack anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can knock off this whiskey recipe and
send it out the door, tell him to beat
[SPEAKER_03]: feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it would be a good energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's exactly what Neville did to
Craig.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exactly what he did to skunk man Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So unfortunately, yeah, things went the
way they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when you get into the handover of
the Holland Seed Bank to Sensei Seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was continued in all reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, initially when Ben bought the
Holland Seed Bank, he attempted to
[SPEAKER_03]: trademark all of the super skunk,
skunk, one, Hayes names, and sent cease
[SPEAKER_03]: and desist letters to other seed companies
telling them, you can't use my names.
[SPEAKER_03]: And skunk man Sam got a letter and
unfortunately for Ben, he had already
[SPEAKER_03]: registered these varieties with the plant
registry and technically was the legal
[SPEAKER_03]: breeder of them in the EU and sent Ben a
letter saying, no, you don't have the
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use the name skunk one on a
lighter or on a t-shirt, but as it comes
[SPEAKER_03]: to cannabis, I own that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you try to stop other people from
using a name that I came up with in the
[SPEAKER_03]: seventies, I will go into court and block
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Ben lost the ability to basically
trademark and register these names that
[SPEAKER_03]: are now very much public domain,
as were the genetics in all reality,
[SPEAKER_03]: because skunk man Sam had been selling
seeds by the kilo long before he met
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And plenty of people had skunk one seeds
and California orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: And originally it was Mel Frank who made
Durbin poison.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Afghan number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was really a lot of other people
that really were the reason why the
[SPEAKER_03]: Holland seed bank had such great varieties
in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a really, in one of his last
interviews, if not his last interview,
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville is in Mishka's book.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he talks about how he was never able
to make anything worth anything from land
[SPEAKER_03]: race varieties of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gives credit to the breeders who
came before him who took things like
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghan, you know, Colombian gold and
aquapoco gold and turned it into skunk one
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, Colombian genetics and
turned it into Hayes and in the first
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I honestly don't know how spectacular
the Holland seed bank would have been if
[SPEAKER_03]: he hadn't gotten those American genetics
from Sam and Greg and others through the
[SPEAKER_03]: eighties, all reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: If he was just left to the Jamaican,
Colombians and Thai seeds coming in
[SPEAKER_03]: through the coffee shops, it might've been
a very different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very intriguing and very interesting
to hear sort of a more inside take on it
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think that was, I wouldn't say a
pet peeve, but something which I always
[SPEAKER_00]: felt uneasy about was how, yeah,
people always said, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's had a shady past, but no one
would ever say to me what.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to hear like, you know,
this is some of what it boiled down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the natural question which
comes to mind for me is in my mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought a lot of those raw base
genetics Neville used to make the crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: came from like one of those mythical land
race trips he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are you sort of more of the opinion
that it was more given to him for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Northern Lights was sent to him as
seeds one through 11, I believe one
[SPEAKER_03]: through 12.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and he made some of them very famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: The number five he used, the number six he
used, the number two he used extensively.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg did send telling me that he never
sent Neville the purest Indica,
[SPEAKER_03]: the zero, if you will, the original egg of
Northern Lights, because he didn't want
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville to have something better than what
he had.
[SPEAKER_03]: He sent Neville the hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I think that growers in some
ways have been wise to the fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're going to get burned to a degree
and they've wanted to protect their IP in
[SPEAKER_03]: various ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Simon Schmidt, who's Dutch and owns
Sirius Seeds, he's a good friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_03]: absolute hero of mine really.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when he first started Sirius Seeds,
he only started with three varieties,
[SPEAKER_03]: AK-47, Chronic and Cali Mist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were all F1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he held the parent plants to each of
those three varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he could make those seeds forever and
ever and ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if somebody bought those seeds and
then crossed them together or outcrossed
[SPEAKER_03]: them, now you got something different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and because of that, you would always
go back for that F1 Cali Mist from Sirius
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeds, because it was exactly what it was
last time you bought the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a way that he protected his
intellectual property, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody could really make an F1 of Cali
Mist but Simon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, as this is, when you look at
it that way, that was happening even with
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why Greg didn't send him the
original Puristinica.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why Scott Mansam didn't give,
that's why, that's why Neville never got
[SPEAKER_03]: original hayseeds is because he didn't
want them to be able to have two of them
[SPEAKER_03]: and make seeds of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wanted to kind of keep control of the
variety a little bit because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, in all reality,
Neville had to wait for the hayseeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't get it even offered to him in 85
or 84 when he first bought the seeds from
[SPEAKER_03]: Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also there wasn't much desire for them
because here there are these long
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering, you know, not even great
yielding comparatively, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Dutch and indoor growers were looking
for quick flowering short plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: yielded that heavy resin that made indoor
growing practical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Hayes sure the hell didn't make indoor
growing practical.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was quite the opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not, there wasn't really a demand for
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when I was living there in 1996,
people, I mean, Cali Mist, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: NL5 Hayes, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But were people growing original Hayes?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: And very few people were actually breeding
with it because not that many people
[SPEAKER_03]: actually had an interest in dealing with
these long flowering finicky plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 1996, I was living in Amsterdam and
I was working at Positronix, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: owned by Bernard and a gentleman named old
Ed, who originally taught Bernard how to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow seedless cannabis in the seventies
was over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he and I worked together for a year,
growing out various varieties of Posse's
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, you know, after 10
years of, you know, politely I'll say half
[SPEAKER_03]: hazard breeding or breeding that wasn't
for, let's say, overall potency or flavor
[SPEAKER_03]: or scent, but instead quickness and yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them didn't have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't that they were kind of
watered down or muddied up would be a
[SPEAKER_03]: polite way to say it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what me and Ed were trying to do was
make selections and then try to make some
[SPEAKER_03]: F1s that could kind of bring back some
hybrid figure and uniformity and
[SPEAKER_03]: consistency to the seeds that Posse was
selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, part of what I wanted to do
when I started my seed company was jump
[SPEAKER_03]: way back and get seeds directly from skunk
man Sam and skip Neville, skip Bernard,
[SPEAKER_03]: skip the whole Dutch scene, you know,
because nothing against, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: I got nothing but love and respect for a
lot of my friends in Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: But realistically, the purpose of what
they were making seeds for was not
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily the purpose of what the
California people who were breeding,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was quality over quantity and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they got out there and it was about,
you know, quantity, quickness and quality
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of went down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of people that were
visiting the Netherlands coffee shop scene
[SPEAKER_03]: through the nineties would attest that the
cannabis wasn't getting better over the
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of getting more and more
homogenous and lackluster and just very
[SPEAKER_03]: similar to each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of that was because of a lot of
inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I hopefully what I'm doing
now is kind of taking it back to the heart
[SPEAKER_03]: of it and going for the quality and going
for those terpenes and going for that
[SPEAKER_03]: sentiment taste over the potency,
even because like, I feel that if you have
[SPEAKER_03]: a good joint like this one is getting me
totally stoned and I'm hard, not hard time
[SPEAKER_03]: getting through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have a good joint, even if it's
not that potent, you'll go back and roll a
[SPEAKER_03]: second or if it's good hash, you'll go
back and pack another dab.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if it's not that good, it doesn't
matter how potent it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like when you drink,
you know, you don't drink straight alcohol
[SPEAKER_03]: to get drunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of like the nuances of the wine
or the beer or whatever it is you're
[SPEAKER_03]: drinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's the same with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think as, as we get back into that
quality over quantity and quickness,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to see a lot better cannabis
hit in the scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, because of like that
quick math, you know, mindset,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the varieties that were 10 weeks and,
you know, 10 to 16 weeks really don't get
[SPEAKER_03]: grown by people anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're still around and think of it
like a box of crayons that have 16
[SPEAKER_03]: crayons.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're only playing with the first 10
crayons.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's crayons number 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, and 16 there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people aren't even doing art with them
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and that's in a sense why I'm really
excited to be bringing the original Hayes
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics back and, and kind of moving
towards these equatorial varieties that
[SPEAKER_03]: used to be shunned because the bag appeal
and growth characteristics, but we're
[SPEAKER_03]: really great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, once you started smoking it,
you'd love it, you know, but would you get
[SPEAKER_03]: past the bag appeal to get your joint
rolled up?
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people don't, they,
they, they eat with their eyes rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: with their taste buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that's going to change as
we move towards concentrates and extracts
[SPEAKER_03]: and people are doing dabs and you're
feeling the terpenes and feeling the
[SPEAKER_03]: synergy of cannabinoids, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think people will start buying
cannabis based on how it makes them feel
[SPEAKER_03]: over how it looks in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I certainly hope so myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so many avenues we could go
off onto with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the first thing I wanted to
quickly run by you was you mentioned this
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of growers protecting their
intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's still a relevant
discussion in today's market, specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: we hear some breeders, not many,
but some who are quite vocal about even if
[SPEAKER_00]: you buy their seeds, you still need to ask
them if you're going to breed with it or
[SPEAKER_00]: something to that effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a good number of breeders take the
opposite point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, man, if you bought them,
they're yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you stand on that issue?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm strange.
[SPEAKER_03]: I stand on both sides of the fence.
[SPEAKER_03]: I completely, I call it public domain
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody invented cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't have this wonderful joint of
haze if it wasn't for, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: some guys named G that was playing with it
a year before I was born.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm grateful for the, you know,
shoulders of the giants I stand upon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I try to give credit where credit to
do it at every corner of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that said, you know, when somebody
like Simon used to use serious seeds as an
[SPEAKER_03]: example, wants to put a company together
and put out a product like Cali Minister,
[SPEAKER_03]: AKA or Chronic, I think they should have a
right to be able to try to make something
[SPEAKER_03]: unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by doing it the way Simon did,
which was so intelligent, it gives his
[SPEAKER_03]: customers a reason to go back and get
those F1 seeds from him because they know
[SPEAKER_03]: why they have a reason to, because they
know it's authentic and he's the only one
[SPEAKER_03]: that held the parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the way it works in plant breeding,
if you buy seeds and you out cross with
[SPEAKER_03]: them, the prodigy is your creation.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, to take somebody's seeds
and just mix them together and to like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, do what so many did,
which is to F2 them without permission is
[SPEAKER_03]: not so cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had original Hayes from 2012 to 2019,
and I was growing it and playing with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't until I started my seed
company that I called up Skunkman Salmon
[SPEAKER_03]: and formally asked his permission to make
seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, within his good grace,
as I did, he even consulted on how he
[SPEAKER_03]: recommended I reproduce those original
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That he gave me so that I would get the
best quality out of the prodigy and have
[SPEAKER_03]: the most variability in selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I got the original Northern Light
seeds from Greg, I again asked his
[SPEAKER_03]: permission.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only did he give me his
permission, he gave me his encouragement
[SPEAKER_03]: because his goal has been to share the
genetics with people and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: to spread the medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of people don't know
Skunkman Sam's goal in the 1970s was to
[SPEAKER_03]: create a true breeding or a relatively
true breeding variety, because he was an
[SPEAKER_03]: acid eating hippie.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wanted his friends to be able to
get the seeds and to be able to mix them
[SPEAKER_03]: together, the brothers and sisters
together, and to have the prodigy come out
[SPEAKER_03]: relatively close to the parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: And normally that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you mix closely related genetics
together, you get like a dog's breakfast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get, you know, a lot of variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The haze has got a lot of variation in its
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not relatively true breeding at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the opposite of Skunk 1.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I asked Skunkman Sam,
you know, how did you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I didn't, nature did.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, I just had to cross together
enough plants to find the ones that when I
[SPEAKER_03]: crossed them together, they had the effect
of being able to be a relatively true
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it kind of went to show how humble he
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a great article that we
republished in our magazine Grow called
[SPEAKER_03]: Sun, Soil, Seeds, and Soul.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wrote it for what was called
Blotter Magazine, which was an LSD
[SPEAKER_03]: magazine that was published by the
gentleman who would go on to publish the
[SPEAKER_03]: psychedelic encyclopedia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wrote this really long breakdown of
how people can learn how to breed and how
[SPEAKER_03]: he created things like Skunk 1.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was trying to share the
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, anybody who's done a lot of acid
would understand that kind of like feeling
[SPEAKER_03]: the oneness with all of humanity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was his goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: His goal was to turn Skunk 1 into this
massive public domain genetic that would
[SPEAKER_03]: only create good cannabis for the rest of
the world once they got the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why Skunk 1 has been bred into
everything because it adds this
[SPEAKER_03]: consistency and uniform to practically
everything that you cross it with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unique in the cannabis kingdom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that's in a way why it became so
famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, truly one of the most famous trends
of all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interesting to hear the backstory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's cool the way Sam's quite
humble about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was interested to quickly loop back for
a moment and ask you, you spoke about the
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland Seed Bank and Positronix and
Sirius Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the seed banks, besides the
seed bank itself, the Holland Seed Bank,
[SPEAKER_00]: like yourself, a lot of reverence for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also really, really looked up to
SuperCetiva Seed Club.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you rank them?
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe that Carl got the inspiration to
create SSSC out of what Neville was doing
[SPEAKER_03]: with the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Carl also went and purchased seeds
from Skunk Man Sam as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody did really.
[SPEAKER_03]: When Sam moved there and started working
with Renard on the green team,
[SPEAKER_03]: they were providing seeds to all of these,
the Flying Dutchman and others that
[SPEAKER_03]: started up even before Sensey Seeds was
Sensey Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the Sensey Seed Club.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was technically SSC and not SSSC,
which was the SuperCetiva Seed Club.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were all doing this to a degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And SSCC was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they got some of the Hayes
genetics and some of the Skunk and some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the stuff that Sam had at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they made some cool things with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would say they probably lost most of
it like many of my friends did over there
[SPEAKER_03]: by not being mindful like Sam was and
keeping it isolated from all the other
[SPEAKER_03]: work he was out crossing and making sure
that he created an IBL line that was vast
[SPEAKER_03]: enough that he could go back to the
original genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they didn't have Afghan and they
didn't have Hindu Kush and they didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have Thai, didn't have anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just that three-way Colombian.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, a lot of them lost it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I started up my seed company,
one of the first orders I received was
[SPEAKER_03]: from SSSC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they wanted to be original Hayes back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, their seeds got sent
back to me because I didn't have a photo
[SPEAKER_03]: sanitary certificate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam was being kind of rude that day,
I guess, at customs.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sure I'll be able to get them the
seeds in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think they played a great role in
this too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think these seed banks were the first
heroes because they were the brave ones
[SPEAKER_03]: that made them available to everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all benefited from it to a large
degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, never worked with some
shitty people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was turned in by the guy that was
actually sending his seeds for him from
[SPEAKER_03]: Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the story in a short way goes that
somebody called Neville up back when
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville was answering the phone and
drummed up a friendship over the phone
[SPEAKER_03]: with Neville from Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Neville invited him out to the castle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this guy, Anthony Ray Cogo,
went out there numerous times and
[SPEAKER_03]: something happened with the seed sender
that Neville had in America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville would send cans of seeds to the
Americas in bulk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then somebody in America would get
addresses and quantities of which variety
[SPEAKER_03]: to send to these addresses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they would package it up in America
and send 10, 20, 15 whatever seeds out at
[SPEAKER_03]: the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, Anthony Ray Cogo was
jealous, was angry, was something at
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, he had been sent
sending Neville seeds for about 18 months.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he got busted for bringing,
from what I understand, hashish into a
[SPEAKER_03]: jail to one of his friends in Michigan and
got arrested for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville sent money to him to help him on
the bequest of his wife.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've read this in the court paperwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: The interesting story is a little bit is
that after Neville passed away,
[SPEAKER_03]: right before he passed away, actually
about two weeks, I was arguing with
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody on Instagram that was claiming
that Sunk Man Sam turned in Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It isn't true.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no truth to it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy that I was arguing with that
was making this point fancied himself an
[SPEAKER_03]: attorney.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he went to a court website and
downloaded Neville's paperwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: He downloaded the two indictments.
[SPEAKER_03]: He downloaded the statements from the
witnesses and the police.
[SPEAKER_03]: And contacted me and said, hey,
you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunk Man Sam had nothing to do with
Neville getting busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was this guy named Ray Anthony Cogo
that used to send his seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, how can you be so certain?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, I'll send you the paperwork.
[SPEAKER_03]: I paid $29.60.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I downloaded all the paperwork anybody
can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was a little shocked.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he sent over the court paperwork and I
got, and I'll send it to you afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, you can, it's quite intriguing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was the whole statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: The statement of Anthony Ray Cogo.
[SPEAKER_03]: The statement was taken in January of
1994.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it starts in, I would say March or
April, May of 1989, when Anthony Ray Cogo
[SPEAKER_03]: willfully went into the DEA with all of
these addresses that he had saved,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though Neville told him to destroy
the addresses after he sent the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: This SOB saved the addresses, brought the
addresses to the DEA and turned in,
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville turned in all these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the same time and cut a deal for
himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And truly amazing, because unfortunately
Neville was paying him to send the seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they made a deal that Neville sold him
the recipe to his nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this guy came back and started selling
Cogo's nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is still for sale today and brags
about the fact that he got the recipe from
[SPEAKER_03]: the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once he had that recipe and he was
making the fertilizer, he really didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: need Neville anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't need to work for Neville
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we turned him in and he acted as an
undercover witness, if you will,
[SPEAKER_03]: 1989, 90, 91, 92, 93, because they didn't
take his sworn statement until January of
[SPEAKER_03]: 94.
[SPEAKER_03]: So poor Neville didn't even know who did
it at first.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take 1990, 91, 92, 93.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a mystery to Neville all the way up
until the case was dismissed in,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, 02, and only then was this
paperwork made public.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was no internet like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you couldn't go to pacer.net or .gov
and download the court file.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it took a long time, I think,
for Neville to truly find out who was
[SPEAKER_03]: really behind turning in the seed bank and
what the real story was.
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately it was this guy,
Anthony Ray Cogo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's inevitably what took Neville
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember SkunkVA said, real life is
always more interesting than fiction or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sort of holds true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the general question that comes to
mind for me after hearing that is we often
[SPEAKER_00]: see a lot of people blaming a lot of stuff
on Dave Watson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had Ryan Lee, Chimera,
who you're probably familiar with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Ryan a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ryan stayed at my house before.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ryan is adamant that, same as you,
Sam's never done any of this bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is, why do you think he's
the scapegoat for all the bad stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think he is a scapegoat for any of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: To put it in plain English, I think
Neville's a fucking asshole for starting
[SPEAKER_03]: the room as he started about David Watson.
[SPEAKER_03]: Calling somebody a DE agent is akin to
calling him a pedophile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the most horrible thing you could
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the biggest traitor in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he knew it wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knew he was lying.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He knew it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he lied anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did it to bolster his own
reputation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was bolstering his own work based
on the work of SkunkVA and Sam,
[SPEAKER_03]: David Watson.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no two shits about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: David was the genius.
[SPEAKER_03]: David still is a genius.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about stability.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just celebrated, I think, his 52nd
wedding anniversary with the same woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you go back to David's history in
1970.
[SPEAKER_03]: Him and his girlfriend sold all their
personal possessions and took a hippie
[SPEAKER_03]: trip from London to Morocco to Germany and
hitchhiked all the way across to India and
[SPEAKER_03]: through Afghanistan, the Hindu Kush
mountains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they lived in India for a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: David collected the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: He brought them back to Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_03]: He started his breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three or four years later, he came up with
Skunk One.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all along the way, he was collecting
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be
smoking haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would have been long lost 40,
45 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was really a savior of the seed and on
a level that no one else really has ever
[SPEAKER_03]: reached.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, to me, David's one of my heroes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people don't really know the depth
of the genius he was, but more people are
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to realize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the longest time, I respected his
wishes and didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I separated his hippie identity from his
professional identity because his skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: man Sam was the acid eating hippie that
was trying to make the world better,
[SPEAKER_03]: getting him good seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when he grew up, had a couple of
daughters, came kind of square and started
[SPEAKER_03]: following the progress of Marinol,
which is a synthetic version of THC and
[SPEAKER_03]: saw there being an opportunity to create a
generic version of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: He literally country shopped, realized he
could start a company in the Netherlands
[SPEAKER_03]: called Horta Farm and he could become the
very first private commercial cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical company in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of the anger that my Dutch
friends, Ben, Renard, Neville,
[SPEAKER_03]: a few others have had against him is that
they didn't understand how he got a
[SPEAKER_03]: license to grow cannabis in the
Netherlands and they didn't know how to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the truth is they could have all
gotten licenses to start a cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical company.
[SPEAKER_03]: If one, they knew what they were frigging
doing, or if they saw the market,
[SPEAKER_03]: the international market for medical
cannabinoids, but they weren't on that
[SPEAKER_03]: trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm actually writing an article
called ants under the skyscraper,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is actually about the formation of
the Dutch seed companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I labeled it that because I feel as if
these guys were like the ants under a
[SPEAKER_03]: skyscraper that cannot comprehend the
engineering or the building that they live
[SPEAKER_03]: under.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't comprehend the sophistication
that's happening on the penthouse floor.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just don't get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those guys didn't get medical cannabis
for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't know what terpenes were.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, look at the pollinator,
nothing against Mila.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she's incredible, but she named
her resin extraction machine male pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like the lack of better
understanding should have been called the
[SPEAKER_03]: resonator because realistically she was
tumbling female flowers and extracting the
[SPEAKER_03]: resin heads from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: She wasn't tumbling male flowers and
extracting the pollen from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's the kind of misunderstanding I
saw when I moved there, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, and I, and I got where,
why there was a mystery.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, you know, what people
don't understand, they often condemn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that a lot of these people
condemned it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when, when Horta farm hit the scene
and suddenly there was this David Watson,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of the people that had met stunk
man, Sam under his fake name, Sam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And his last name was his hippie acid
nickname jingles just spelled backwards,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is really kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's a big dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's over six foot tall and he used to
wear these gesture hats that had bells on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he would, there'd be these like
legendary acid parties in the sixties
[SPEAKER_03]: before it was, you know, illegal and,
and the seventies still, and, and they
[SPEAKER_03]: were heavy in a psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is where the grateful dad was born.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are the Santa Cruz mountains where
Ken Kesey was and the Mary pranksters
[SPEAKER_03]: were, this is, this is what was going on
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he used to wear a gesture's cap that,
that jingles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so his nickname was jingles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he moved over there, it was also
stunk man Sam.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when he moved over there, it just
became Sam Seldnage, which was jingles
[SPEAKER_04]: backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my friend who publishes grow
magazine, when you meet him, he usually
[SPEAKER_03]: says his name's guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not it's Steve, but he has a wife and
a kids and he's, you know, trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: create a little bit of division between
his family and the, and the BS and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was no different back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when people discovered that stunk
man Sam was David Watson, they turned it
[SPEAKER_03]: into a big conspiracy and it really
wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, unfortunately, just because
of their own lack of imagination,
[SPEAKER_03]: they didn't start cannabinoid research,
you know, companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they didn't know anything about
it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't see the market potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have multimillion dollar
investors that wanted to invest into what
[SPEAKER_03]: could become a multi-billion dollar
company in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think these guys were forward
looking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you look at the work they put
out, like hashish, hemp diseases and
[SPEAKER_03]: pests, later cannabis, evolution and
ethnobotany, you know, even the hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: industries association that put out a peer
reviewed journal printed on 100% hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: paper and provided hemp educational kits
made out of like hemp wax crayons and
[SPEAKER_03]: plastics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, you name it, hemp seeds,
fabric, all of it, paper, and then sent it
[SPEAKER_03]: to universities so that the academics at
the universities would get a better
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like to, to call these people DEA agents
is the most ridiculous shit you could ever
[SPEAKER_03]: call them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's like, if you think the DEA is
going to let their rogue agents write
[SPEAKER_04]: these incredible volumes of cannabis
history and practical utility,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're, they're spending billions
of dollars to go against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you think they're going to plant these
two guys in the Netherlands so that they
[SPEAKER_04]: can pursue cannabinoid research and then
write about it and then send this damn
[SPEAKER_04]: information to the universities,
which is only going to work to subvert the
[SPEAKER_03]: propaganda that the DEA is putting out in
the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I take great offense at the lies and
the rumors that were not only started by
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville, that were continued and
circulated by Ben Dronkers, by Renard
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruning and others who knew that they were
lying, but were lying to benefit their own
[SPEAKER_03]: reputation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still think they should be condemned
for doing so because I wouldn't want
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody calling me a DEA agent after I
self surrendered and did a five year
[SPEAKER_03]: prison sentence rather than cooperate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's the worst thing you can say
to somebody that has a clear conscience,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I'm glad that skunk man Sam has
outlived a lot of these people and that
[SPEAKER_03]: the truth has come out and that his
reputation is being, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: for what it really is, you know,
not based on some heroin addict's fantasy
[SPEAKER_03]: of what he wished it was, but on the
reality of, of, of a lifelong's worth of
[SPEAKER_03]: work, basically protecting the seed,
sharing the information and doing good
[SPEAKER_03]: for, for the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and that's, I feel really passionate
about skunk man Sam and David Watson.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's one of the nicest people I've ever
known.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've known him since 1994.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the most solid people I've ever
known.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, a lot of us don't have
relationships with our loved ones that
[SPEAKER_03]: last 51, two years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it really goes to show what
kind of a person he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody that I know that knows him
really loves him and has respect and
[SPEAKER_03]: admiration for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I, after knowing him for so
long, I understand why he's never done a
[SPEAKER_03]: bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's never said a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's never lied to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me that matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very impassionate and informative answer
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone who I've spoken to, who knows him
personally has echoed your sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I've just got two final little
questions on Neville before we sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I'm interested for the last
few years before Neville passed away,
[SPEAKER_00]: because he did pass away a few years ago
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually a little bit active on the
Mr. Nice Guy forums and he was causing a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of waves over there with some of the
stuff he posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, did you ever get around
to reading that and did you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on any of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some of the stuff he posted went
very much against the grain of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: stories that were circulating sort of
said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think maybe he was just a bit
unwell or do you think there was maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: some truth to it all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I think Neville was one of
the, you know, first cannabis people to
[SPEAKER_03]: like reinvent the stories and put out
misinformation to benefit himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, when he broke up with Ari
and very publicly, you know, for those
[SPEAKER_03]: that read forums back then, it wasn't a
pretty divorce.
[SPEAKER_03]: He took his genetics and he sold them to
Scotty.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't move to Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't follow Scotty.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't go do breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, here you go, give me money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he helped market the genetics that
Scotty was making in Switzerland until the
[SPEAKER_03]: point where Scotty got busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, Scotty also went to
jail for five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe it was quite a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Neville was already out of
the picture at that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what of those genetics
were saved or lost because I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scotty is Shanty Baba, by the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I knew Scotty as the guy that
worked for Ari and when I first went to
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam, Ari and Scotty, you know,
Scotty was like his assistant,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like Scotty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always thought Scotty was really
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know him around the name change.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't know where the Shanty
Baba came from, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and I think Scotty's a good
bro, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a lot of experience and stuff,
but he inherited the genetics that he got
[SPEAKER_03]: from Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Neville pulled the same
thing with Ari and that he pulled with
[SPEAKER_03]: Ben.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, when him and Ben broke up,
he took his genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had people that he knew that worked it
since, since he destroyed the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even worse, I mean, I know firsthand
that the person that supposedly was
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to destroy the plants,
stole the plants, and then years later
[SPEAKER_04]: offered them back for sale to Sensei,
which is just such double cross.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just like, but you saw a lot of it
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, but he broke up with Ben
and, you know, talk shit about Ben.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he broke up with Ari and talked
shit about Ari and, you know, and I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know what his relationship with Scotty was
towards the end, but he was using the form
[SPEAKER_03]: as a soapbox.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, a lot of the stuff that
I've seen, it doesn't go with the stories
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg's told me, the stories Rob Clark's
told me, the stories that Skunkman Sam's
[SPEAKER_03]: told me, the story that Ben's told me,
and Alan Dronker's.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spent time with all these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, unfortunately, they sing a
similar song, and they're not in the same
[SPEAKER_03]: room together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, it doesn't paint a very
pretty picture.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it paints a picture of people
that were disappointed in somebody that
[SPEAKER_03]: they tried to like a lot, you know,
but somebody that was dealing with the
[SPEAKER_03]: demons of addiction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, that was spilling into
the rest of their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Neville was haunted in a polite way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And who knows what kind of a person he
would have been if you take the heroin and
[SPEAKER_03]: the alcohol away.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it could have been a whole
different world for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He could still be alive today,
but it's not the Neville that he was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just got to accept people for what
they are and, you know, give sympathy and
[SPEAKER_03]: pity where it belongs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, anybody who's a drug addict,
I feel for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, not one, but I have nothing
but empathy for people that are struggling
[SPEAKER_03]: with addiction, but it doesn't give them a
free pass to be able to try to destroy the
[SPEAKER_03]: reputations of good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when they know they're lying,
you know, especially when they know what
[SPEAKER_03]: they're saying is not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that form, I kind of condemn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I understand where you're coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think maybe the saddest part about
what you just said is that I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: banged it on their head in that Neville
probably likely would still be around if
[SPEAKER_00]: he didn't have those demons.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other end of the spectrum,
the question has to be asked, would we
[SPEAKER_00]: have had the same offerings from him?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was the addiction that caused him
to start the seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget, it was a grant from the
Dutch government because he was dealing
[SPEAKER_03]: with addiction maintenance and they were
trying to get him on to starting a
[SPEAKER_03]: business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Dutch government gave them a loan
to start the Holland seed bank back in
[SPEAKER_03]: 1984, which is quite astonishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, only in the Netherlands could
this story be what the reality is always
[SPEAKER_03]: much stranger than fiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, to loop it back, I guess I sort of
wanted to end the Neville discussion on a
[SPEAKER_00]: more brighter note.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something which I've always suspected
is that the point you made about how he's
[SPEAKER_00]: like a DJ, you know, he's sort of mixing
and mashing other people's work,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of resonated with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I thought is if we're going to
use those terms to keep it simple,
[SPEAKER_00]: I sort of get the feeling there haven't
really been as many DJs on the same level
[SPEAKER_00]: as Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, as much as I agree with what you're
saying, he didn't create the music,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak, so he shouldn't be credited
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also feel like he did a pretty darn
good job as a DJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think there are any other
people who are in that same echelon of
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing and matching and creating really
standout work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Kenny, Kenny Morrow,
Tricrome Technologies, that poster behind
[SPEAKER_03]: me over here, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kenny, Ultraviolet, which was what became
Purple Passion, Granddaddy Purple,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything else was his work back in the
mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_03]: He released that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's released quite a few varieties over
the course of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Simon Schmidt, I think, is a phenomenal
breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he went to school for plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: His company has been around now,
I think, 30 years almost.
[SPEAKER_03]: 94, I think, it started.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's coming close to around his 30 year
anniversary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's skunk man Sam,
who is really a god over Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Neville used to really kind of
attack Sam all the time, but Neville never
[SPEAKER_03]: made a skunk one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville never made any of the varieties
that Sam gave and sold to him and that he
[SPEAKER_03]: built his business upon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he always tried to steal the credit
from where the credit was due,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is something I don't do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but then again, when you look at
a lot of these California varieties,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Sour Diesel, Trainwreck,
Green Crack, God Bud, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I could go on and on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who made California Orange?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, but it was really good weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, unfortunately through the
drug war, we didn't get a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: who had the courage that Neville really
had to stick his head above the water and
[SPEAKER_03]: say, yeah, I did that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll give him credit to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think we should, you know,
I wanted to emulate him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was, when I met him, he was still a hero
to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, his courage to do something that
was, you know, wrong was right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, selling the seed to the
community was a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, Operation Green Merchant
came out of it and he got a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: busted because of his poor relationships
or his poor picking of relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, you can't go back and fix
the people that screw you over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sometimes wonder if that guy was a cop
the whole time and that that was a full
[SPEAKER_03]: engagement because why else would he have
saved all those addresses if he didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: plan on using those addresses at a later
time to his benefit?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was clearly a back door that he
was leveraging at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was also growing and doing his own
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe he just felt like if he did get
popped, he would just turn over,
[SPEAKER_03]: which he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you read, when you get it,
you'll see what I mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you read it, he went willingly to the
DEA and turned in Neville and turned in
[SPEAKER_03]: all of his customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's two sides of every
sword, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, a lot of people got
sliced by it, but it created a new
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity and look at all the seed
companies, SSSC, the Flying Dutchman,
[SPEAKER_03]: Paradise Seed, Luke is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, he's a really good one too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Luke has maintained a long time since he
stars, a great variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's other people like,
you know, the guy that made White Widow,
[SPEAKER_03]: his name was Egmar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much of a greeter, but he made a
variety that a lot of people, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: to this day recognize, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there has been a lot of people
along the way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Greg is another one, the guy,
Murphy Stevens that really started all
[SPEAKER_03]: this with his afghan is also very
underrated to a large degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all smoking prodigy from what he
started, you know, way back when.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked Skunk Man Sam before, what would
have been the most popular cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: variety had you not released Skunk One?
[SPEAKER_03]: And without a hiccup, he said,
oh, Norton Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so Norton Lights was that
impactful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, you know, those afghans that
Murphy Stevens Indica was floating around
[SPEAKER_03]: in the 70s and 80s long before Neville
ever started a seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how many of these other varieties also
have it?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know, you know, and, you know,
the truth is, is that unless we really get
[SPEAKER_03]: good genetic testing, DNA testing,
and we get better samples in, we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: going to know the relations of these
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I once asked Ben Dronkers,
I said, Hey, are you going to send your
[SPEAKER_03]: samples in to get DNA tested?
[SPEAKER_03]: He looked at me, we were sitting together
getting high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, why?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can prove all these genetic tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he, and I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've made a living making millions of
dollars selling Jack Daniel's whiskey in
[SPEAKER_04]: your distillery and you ain't never had to
pay Jack.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you want to, I don't think
you want to, who is the daddy test?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, because do you really want it to
come back and say, you're not the father,
[SPEAKER_04]: Ben, actually it's him, you know,
and, you know, and I, and I think that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what a lot of them don't want to see
happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, when you even look at
phylos, which is interesting on a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: levels, I don't agree with what they did
with community and conception nurseries
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that aside.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when, when you look at what they were
doing and you look at them using OG Kush
[SPEAKER_03]: as like a backbone to all these other
varieties, I think it's misplaced.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you took out OG Kush and you put
Northern Lights number two, then it would
[SPEAKER_03]: make sense because I remember life before
OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because phylos didn't have a good
Northern Lights sample, they didn't have
[SPEAKER_03]: anything other than OG Kush forward to go
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's for those, I mean, OG Kush is
1996, 1997.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that old.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, original Hayes, 69 skunk one 76,
a lot of, you know, Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern Lights was named Northern Lights
when he sent the seeds to Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: Up to that point, he was just keeping
track of the crosses being made.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the people within the circle that he
was sharing the Afghani seeds from Murphy
[SPEAKER_03]: Stevens with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he, Greg does not take credit for
making Northern Lights number five.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said that it was a Herbie, I think that
worked at the Sunset shop, the indoor sun
[SPEAKER_03]: shop that worked for Murphy Stevens made
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because they were all sharing
genetics, Greg had some of those hybrid
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and initially when he sent it over as
Northern Lights, he, he spelled to
[SPEAKER_03]: L-I-T-E-S like a light bulb, like turn the
light on because it was all being grown in
[SPEAKER_03]: the North under lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and you know, cause you know,
L-I-T-E is more like illumination,
[SPEAKER_03]: L-I-G-H-T more like the weight of
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was going with L-I-T-E-S and Neville
changed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville changed it to L-I-G-H-T-E-S and
called it Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the little, the little funnies in the
story have always intrigued me,
[SPEAKER_03]: but these genetics were floating around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quite a while before Neville took them and
broadcast them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And realistically, I don't think Neville
was so much a great DJ as he had a great
[SPEAKER_03]: platform.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he was like the first dude at
Ibiza with, you know, two turntables and a
[SPEAKER_03]: microphone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every he's like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that, and you know, a lot of people
have come since and probably been better
[SPEAKER_04]: DJs, but he was the first one to,
to, to seed bank it, turn it on,
[SPEAKER_03]: print catalogs and send seeds all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he deserves credit for being one
courageous person and unfortunately he
[SPEAKER_03]: paid dearly for his courage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A brilliant answer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I might just take us back a little bit
because you just brought it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk a little bit more about the
Northern Lights stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess one of the questions I was
wondering was, as you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was sort of different tropical males
being crossed to this pure syndica and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's generating the different numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four, five.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just a female because they had
the seeds of the pure syndica.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as they would grow out the pure syndica
seeds, I have boys and girls of pure
[SPEAKER_03]: syndica downstairs, so I can go either
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wasn't just girls being married to
tropical males.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know, and when I interviewed
Greg, he, he's really humble too,
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like Sam, when I asked them,
you know, what the genetics were,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's like, we'll never really know,
will we?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just a beautiful, it's a
beautiful honesty that I really
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause one of the things I don't like about
the cannabis community is how certain
[SPEAKER_03]: people are about, you know, things they
don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even now, everything I'm saying is
just from my journalistic research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it's from my personal
interactions, but you know, most of it's
[SPEAKER_03]: from research and me trying to gather
stories from different parties and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and finding the thread of truth through it
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's always been my goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really not biased to what the truth
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just would like to know what it really
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful sentiment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it did make me wonder,
did Greg ever mention anything about any
[SPEAKER_00]: of the other parents being kept in a pure
form or was it just the purest Indica?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would just cross it,
but never keep the other things pure as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you know, the way I look at it is
this, if you had groups of people,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, you have one guy playing
with what was a Hawaiian, maybe Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexican and crossing it with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had his genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was the guy that they
referred to as the Indian and lived out on
[SPEAKER_03]: an island.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had his genetics and he crossed it
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I see is like a pure color,
a primary color, and then the color is
[SPEAKER_03]: shared.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then some people are mixing a little
yellow, some people are mixing a little
[SPEAKER_03]: blue, some are mixing a little brown,
some have yellow and some have orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're all coming out with something
slightly different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're sharing again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how Greg kind of described it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it makes sense to me as somebody that
has friends and loosely shares genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: and then gets them go, you've got to have
these seeds back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made them from your variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Greg initially sent seeds
to Neville because he wanted to trade with
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wanted some of the varieties Neville
had.
[SPEAKER_03]: He made a comment, oh, because Neville
never sent me back anything nearly as good
[SPEAKER_03]: as we sent him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get where he's coming from too,
you know, because if he's a person
[SPEAKER_03]: experiencing the F1s from his friends who
are first making them, he's going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: more robust prodigy because they're going
to have the hybridized effect of,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, consistency, uniformity and
bigger more so than the plants that are
[SPEAKER_03]: being maybe inbred and inbred again,
or being bred with genetics more closely
[SPEAKER_03]: related to one another, you know,
which I'm sure Chimera talked about when
[SPEAKER_03]: he was on because he's brilliant when it
comes to breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, normally like humans,
we're not trying to, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: have sex with our cousins because,
you know, babies don't come out so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of similar with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I think this is also why a
lot of Neville's initial offerings were so
[SPEAKER_03]: good because he was making these F1
hybrids with distinctly different
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics, original haze, males and
northern lights, females or skunk,
[SPEAKER_03]: which didn't have any northern lights in
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk man Sam never had northern lights
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: He never got them.
[SPEAKER_03]: He never worked with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the other side of it, Greg never
could get his hands on original skunk and
[SPEAKER_03]: never got his hands on original haze
until, you know, some fucking kid like me
[SPEAKER_03]: comes along and sends them to him in his
retirement sometime in like 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I sent him those seeds,
you know, so, you know, it's you never
[SPEAKER_03]: know how it's going to work out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, Greg was in Vietnam from
1965 and 1969 joined when he was 17.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he was going to be drafted and
started smoking cannabis when he was in
[SPEAKER_03]: Vietnam and brought back the habit or the
hobby and started growing in 1969 as soon
[SPEAKER_03]: as he got home.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was taking horticultural classes at
the university in Seattle and the
[SPEAKER_03]: University of Washington.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny because he's in his 70s now
and he is still taking university courses
[SPEAKER_03]: online.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he shares with me links, constantly
about, you know, testing sugar content in
[SPEAKER_03]: your plants and like how to avoid
different diseases and like light
[SPEAKER_03]: penetration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's such an avid learner and I
absolutely adore it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I absolutely hope I have his vigor for
life when I'm his age.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's not that long.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fucking 50 now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to just keep up with the
health food.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just kept it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think he met Murphy Stevens in
around sometime in the 70s, mid 70s after
[SPEAKER_03]: the book came out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said to me that he first got those
four seeds from Murphy Stevens in 1979.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was one of the, you know,
the best Afghans that he had ever gotten
[SPEAKER_03]: up to that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of the hippies initially
were breeding with more tropical varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: that were coming in Thai, Vietnam,
Mexican, Colombian.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all semi-tropical.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't until the hippies started coming
back from the hippie trail with Afghan
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties in the mid 70s that these
skunky, stinky, earthy tones were kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: brought in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these fast flowering, heavy yielding
broad leaflet varieties were starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: get brought into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Original skunk one started as one of these
Afghans crossed with Colombian gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he took that plant and crossed it
with everything he had until he realized
[SPEAKER_03]: that when he crossed it with Acapulco
gold, that that combination of genetics,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you grew out the prodigy and you
spread the prodigy together would be
[SPEAKER_03]: consistent uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he did that with all of the different
ones he had and threw them away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once he realized up, this is the right
genetic block in order to go with what I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of people won't spend the
time, won't, you know, he always,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you ever could talk to him,
you'll say, you know, he kills plants more
[SPEAKER_03]: than he grows them, but I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you can't get attached,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it doesn't meet the standards out of
the garden, it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what really makes great
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I think that a lot of the,
unfortunately, you know, people that came
[SPEAKER_03]: along later, weren't really working on the
scale that he was working on, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: tens of thousands of plants at a time,
you know, 50,000 skunk seeds or 50,000
[SPEAKER_03]: originally seeds in a single 50,000 square
meter greenhouse going off at once and
[SPEAKER_03]: creating, you know, more seeds of its own
variety is something a lot of us don't get
[SPEAKER_03]: the opportunity to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was in a position to kind of
maintain his genetic gene pool on a level
[SPEAKER_03]: that few others were.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he, you know, from my interviews
with him, my conversations, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: when he was doing a horta farm,
there's no limit on seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody cared about the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's no drug content on the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course you need to save the seeds
because you need to grow more plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the one thing he could do was really
intense breeding and saving of genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was in a really unique position,
uh, that unfortunately small scale seed
[SPEAKER_03]: companies, you know, any name,
any of them just weren't in a position to
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The position, few of us will probably ever
be able to find ourselves in sadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to bring you back for a
moment to the Steve Murphy's Afghani,
[SPEAKER_00]: the purest indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they ever have a cutting they kept,
or they just use the seeds every year?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow-up, what type of Afghani
do you think it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it was just like a hash plant
or like more akin to Afghani number one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghani number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got Afghani number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I sell Mel Frank's seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mel Frank is 77 years old now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been friends for since 96.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met him at Positronics in Amsterdam one
day when he was walking through and he was
[SPEAKER_03]: complimenting some plants and I was the
one that was growing the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and we got to talking and it was just
a really good connection and we became
[SPEAKER_03]: friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were best friends to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, the Afghan number one is okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, it's not, uh, the Northern lights,
purest indica is really exceptional.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the, the Afghani number one has,
in my opinion, some more tropical
[SPEAKER_03]: influence in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not pure Afghan, like the purest
indica is, and, uh, it's, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it, you know, maybe I'm really sticky
too though, cause like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, uh, you know, when you have one
thing and you think it's great,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's cause sometimes you don't have things
to compare it to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when I had other things,
I, when I had Afghan one initially,
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was great, you know,
but then I got all these Northern lights
[SPEAKER_04]: plants and these Afghans, the purest
indica from Greg.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought, Whoa, that's really
incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it changed my perspective of Afghani
number one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you know, I, I'm going to sound
like a jerk too, but I don't really like
[SPEAKER_03]: Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I sell the seeds because it's
authentic Durban poison and it has a real,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's got a great bud structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got great resin.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people smoke it, love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, screw my opinion,
but it's, it's not one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, but you know, what I've been trying to
do at the seed company is really make
[SPEAKER_03]: these advances.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be accessible to people because I don't
know the, you know, The cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: that'll be fine or the terpium
combinations that will be found.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think there's still a lot to be
found in these genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think all of the genetics are
medically useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of, of identifying them
and, uh, and finding them into medical
[SPEAKER_03]: utility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's starting to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, there'll come a day,
I believe when, when people will go in and
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll have their endocannabinoid system
tested and they'll be able to just like
[SPEAKER_03]: they look at your blood and they can tell
you what vitamins and minerals you're
[SPEAKER_03]: deficient in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll be able to pull off the shelf
all of these various single cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_03]: put them together and maybe add some
terpenes for a bit of an, I hate to use
[SPEAKER_03]: the word entourage, but it's more of an
ensemble effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way they synergistically work
together will be how we use it to battle
[SPEAKER_03]: once our endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more we have these genetics
available and the more people can start to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow them and test them and, and discover
them, you know, the more we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have more colors we're going to have to
pull from when we're turning around and
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to, you know, color in our life and
make it, make it better.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, cause I, you know, obviously
I've had cancer a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty certain we're all going to die
at the end of this wonderfully short trip,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's about our quality of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really about, you know, the time
you're present and being present and
[SPEAKER_03]: treating, you know, time like it's a
present and really appreciating it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think cannabis plays this really key
fundamental role in our wellness.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this really becomes a
conversation about wellness more than it's
[SPEAKER_03]: a conversation about, you know,
getting high on a Friday night,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and feeling good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think more people are going to start
to understand that as they come to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand that they have an
endocannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Endocannabinoid system in that it can help
balance them better than pharmaceuticals
[SPEAKER_03]: or better than heroin or better than
alcohol or better than smoking cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people I think are going to turn
to cannabis like you and I have and really
[SPEAKER_03]: help them help their life considerably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, here, hopefully, hopefully the
medical sort of improvements lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something a little left of field,
but I thought you might have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective on was often when we talk to
guests about the really old school
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, they reference how they really
like them because there was no ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, weed these days, it only gets
you so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I'd be interested in hearing
your thoughts on the ceiling effect and
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how does it occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just land races have no ceiling and
when we hybridize things, they get
[SPEAKER_00]: ceilings?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: I get what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been sitting here for an hour
and 32 minutes and I've only managed to
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke half a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff and it's a lot because with the
haze, you feel it, you know, like you hit
[SPEAKER_03]: it and you feel it and you go put it down
for a minute because you're like
[SPEAKER_03]: self-titration happens quickly when you're
smoking this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mostly I feel like with the haze
varieties that this that you can keep
[SPEAKER_03]: getting higher and higher and higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like you end up doing what I'm
doing, which is you hit it a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: and go, well, I'm doing an interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to keep my shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you end up putting it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find half joints of haze all over my
head.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's because I get really
high and I put them down and then I get
[SPEAKER_04]: distracted and I am so high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget I leave the joint there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't do that as much with more of
the modern varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, if I go to the store in
California, buy some pot, I'm not that
[SPEAKER_03]: impressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been fortunate enough to be a
cannabis cup judge for high time,
[SPEAKER_03]: for the cup, for the secret cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a photographer for them,
for Chalice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a judge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had some exposure to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, a lot of the cannabis
floating around California is quite
[SPEAKER_03]: homogenous and it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of standouts.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they call haze isn't really haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was judging concentrates and I sat down
next to the gentleman that owns I'll just
[SPEAKER_03]: say a gentleman that owns one of the
bigger extraction companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he always gives me what a little jar
or whatever he's smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I gave him mine and I had made some
extract out of haze and he opened it and
[SPEAKER_03]: he smelled it and he was like,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, that's original haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was just like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were sitting with maybe a hundred
plus samples in front of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I made the comment and I said,
you know what's weird after smoking all
[SPEAKER_03]: this stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I could put this haze jar down
and it would stand out out of all of
[SPEAKER_03]: these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, oh, it's absolutely unlike
everything else here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had, I think 119 samples in front
of us that year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just because growers didn't want
to spend the extra time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you take Northern California into
an example, you know, when you get north
[SPEAKER_03]: of San Francisco, it's not the most
hospitable place to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your ability and variety is limited by
your early winters, your early rain,
[SPEAKER_03]: your heavy humidity, that coastal fog.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have hats off to everybody in
Northern California that can turn out
[SPEAKER_03]: really high quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are a lot of people who do,
but they're not growing no three-way
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombian haze up there until December
with that weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're limited.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because they're limited to their
environment, we see the limit to their
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics that they offer as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Emerald Cup is my favorite event in
the world and everybody should visit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you go to the Emerald Cup,
most of all those varieties have always
[SPEAKER_03]: been under 10 week varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only last year when I was there taking
photos for growing Magnolia, I was in a
[SPEAKER_03]: magazine and they had all of the varieties
separated by their dominant terpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is the future, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so now you've got orange
competing with orange and you've got gas
[SPEAKER_03]: competing with gas and you've got sweet
tropical with sweet tropical and you've
[SPEAKER_03]: got, you know, hazy, you know,
train wreck type varieties competing with
[SPEAKER_03]: hazy train wreck type varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're not trying to compare,
you know, California orange to OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by breaking it down into your dominant
terpene category, you're starting to get a
[SPEAKER_03]: better understanding of which like,
let's go back to colors, which primary
[SPEAKER_03]: color groups that that variety happens to
fall into.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause if it's pineene or if it's
terpenilene or mercy dominant,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's going to fall into that group.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a limonene dominant terpene
plant is going to smell lemony period.
[SPEAKER_03]: So group them together, judge them for
what they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's really neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, there wasn't very much when
it came to really hazy varieties offered
[SPEAKER_03]: at the time, because again, it's an
organic Northern California event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they moved down to maybe,
you know, they're not really growing it in
[SPEAKER_03]: Santa Barbara yet either.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you see growers starting to grow
cannabis in areas that are more warm and
[SPEAKER_03]: they can leave plants in the ground until
November, December, you know, when you
[SPEAKER_03]: start getting south of Santa Cruz in
California, you start to experience this
[SPEAKER_03]: type of, you know, summer all the time
weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's really two distinctly
different weather patterns in Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: California that split around Pismo beach
on North of Santa Barbara and Santa
[SPEAKER_03]: Barbara South.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got hot sunny days, you know,
all year long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then North of Santa Barbara,
you start to get more wintery as you get
[SPEAKER_03]: more North and you know, people are going
to start growing, you know, these long
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering varieties in places like
Northern Santa Barbara and LA and further
[SPEAKER_03]: south.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think you're going to experience
cannabis like we haven't experienced in
[SPEAKER_03]: decades, because a lot of the cannabis
coming in in the 50s and 60s was coming in
[SPEAKER_03]: from tropical, semi-tropical places.
[SPEAKER_03]: That changed when we started getting stuff
from Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the 70s, when the hippies and
others started mixing together,
[SPEAKER_03]: hippies and the soldiers started greeting
together various varieties of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: coming up with the higher breds that we,
the Hayes, the skunk, the Hindu Kush,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Calio, the Afghani one, the Durban,
you know, we could go on and on about what
[SPEAKER_03]: became of those land race varieties that
those guys originally got in the first
[SPEAKER_03]: place and then morph them into the
varieties that we know today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then those primary varieties were
crossed together to make a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: wedding cakes and the skittles and the
runs and the stuff that we are now
[SPEAKER_03]: re-referencing to today, because none of
that stuff was bred from brand new land
[SPEAKER_03]: race crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all bred from the seeds they got on
vacation to Amsterdam or through a friend
[SPEAKER_03]: who was already growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And quality was just passed on,
passed on, because why go through all that
[SPEAKER_03]: shit and try to recreate the work others
have done successfully when you can take
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk one seeds, grow them out,
and then take another variety,
[SPEAKER_03]: grow them out, mix them together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody claps at you because you're
a DJ and they didn't think of mixing
[SPEAKER_03]: together the Beatles white album and the
Jay Z black album until they heard your
[SPEAKER_03]: gray album.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're like, oh, that's the
shit, you know, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, not musicians, but still,
you know, I think the best thing these
[SPEAKER_03]: seed breeders today can do is give credit
where credit's due.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason you don't see me making up a
lot of funny names on my seed website is
[SPEAKER_03]: because I'm just trying to give credit
where credit's due.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to come in and pretend
like, you know, you know, I'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: reinventing the wheel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I do make varieties that are
unique to me that are unique to my
[SPEAKER_03]: company.
[SPEAKER_03]: But usually those in those cases,
I just call them what I made it out of,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I want to leave breadcrumbs for
the people who buy my seeds so that
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll kind of know where to go with
their crosses, because then it gives them
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like a dog or pedigree information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they have the pedigree information,
you know, maybe they can make a better
[SPEAKER_03]: cross after they get my seeds and they
cross them with something they have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I encourage it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where I think it's kind of shady is when
you know, I sent I sent a company seeds in
[SPEAKER_03]: February, seven months later, they knocked
off those seeds, claiming that now they
[SPEAKER_03]: finally have skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they they told a brand new story
about skunk one, said Sam the skunk man
[SPEAKER_03]: got out of jail in 1981.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that these seeds came to France in
like 1974 kilo.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all bullshit, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Sam didn't even make skunk one in
1974.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't come around till after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these people that come and they try to
reinvent the history to benefit
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's shady.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think they should get called out for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think that, you know,
the cannabis community deserves an
[SPEAKER_03]: authentic and real history, and not a
history that's been maligned by marketing
[SPEAKER_03]: people, you know, that were trying to
market their seeds or market their
[SPEAKER_03]: company, and trying to, you know,
you know, basically steal the wind out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the sails of others, because they're still
doing it to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is invariably one of the discussion
points I thought we were going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: touch on, which hopefully give people a
bit more background.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, as you just alluded to,
you know, there has been some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: ongoing what's the word they use in the
news.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been robust conversations between
yourself and aficionado around a skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: release.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just wondering if you could give us
a little bit more of the backstory on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, simply put, they contacted me,
actually, way back in July of 2020,
[SPEAKER_03]: asking me for seeds, because they were
following what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I told them they weren't going to be
available yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told them they'd be available in
probably like seven, eight months.
[SPEAKER_03]: February of 2021, they contacted me
saying, hey, can you know, we saw them on
[SPEAKER_03]: your website, can we get some?
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, or fortunately,
you know, it's weird, I almost didn't sell
[SPEAKER_03]: them the seeds because they have a bad,
they have a reputation, we'll just say,
[SPEAKER_03]: of doing this with other varieties and
other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I I've had words with Leo,
who's aficionado here in California in the
[SPEAKER_03]: past.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they contacted me through Frenchy
Canole.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just I adore Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's since we met, we were friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got nothing but love for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was one of the most authentic
people who had such a true passion for
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will miss him forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am crushed that he's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, I absolutely got nothing
but love for Frenchy, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were looking for the skunk
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were very upfront about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they contacted me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, this is why after he said
I was a liar, I posted the conversation up
[SPEAKER_03]: on Instagram, because I'm not a liar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would never misinterpret the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just not it's not my thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not afraid of the ramifications of
truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't have to lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyone who has to lie can go
themselves, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just how I feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I got him the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent him some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent him roadkill.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent him skunk one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I even sent him extra seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent some for Frenchy so he'd have some
to grow at his house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, and then they get the seeds like
February 26.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, end of August,
end of August, they released that bam,
[SPEAKER_03]: I got skunk one seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, they f2d their 1974 seeds from a kilo
and told this elaborate story.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was that such bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people in the community, I think also
recognized it as bullshit and started
[SPEAKER_03]: calling it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I mean, skunk one of all the
freaking varieties to lie about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why pick skunk one?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so documented.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and it was weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I called him out on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I woke up that morning and called
him out on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually happened a little earlier,
though, because when I got the RKS,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was from that guy, Jaime in Alaska,
who's another great guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's an old biker that's been growing
forever in a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people gave him nothing but shit for
saying that he had roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he sent it to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it is it is it is really
what he says it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just it's not as strong as people
would would would want it to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said this to him and I've been
really upfront and honest about this to a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said it's there, but you're going to
have to look through plants to really find
[SPEAKER_03]: that one that is going to blow your away
and stink out the car and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: be smelled down the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, since this conversation has
started, you know, I don't know how much
[SPEAKER_03]: you're into the files.
[SPEAKER_03]: So files are what I now believe are the
cause of the skunk acrid smell in these
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Humans can detect files and parts per
trillion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it makes it hard for machines to even
be able to detect it in measurable amounts
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So files are what I believe a lot of these
aspects of African varieties that smelled
[SPEAKER_03]: like urine and acrid, dead flesh and
skunks to Americans.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where a lot of this came from,
because when you talk to Robert Clark,
[SPEAKER_03]: who is, to me, the foremost historian on
cannabis in the world, a lot of the more
[SPEAKER_03]: tropical varieties have sweeter scents and
a lot of these more lemony and citrusy and
[SPEAKER_03]: flowery tones we're getting are coming
from the Acapulco gold, the Colombians,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Thais, the Mexicans and such.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these files are what I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Initially, when everybody started breeding
with the Afghans, they all took on this
[SPEAKER_03]: heavy scent.
[SPEAKER_03]: But because the way humans work is that
this is something that when we smell makes
[SPEAKER_03]: my our brain think, oh, this is going bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Avoid it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We slowly bred away from it and bred
towards the sense that we're more
[SPEAKER_03]: appealing, which were the fruity,
flavorful, tasty dessert type when you go
[SPEAKER_03]: for a walk down the street, you do not
stick your nose in a pile of dog shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You stick your nose in a rose.
[SPEAKER_03]: You smell flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think for cannabis cultivators,
especially considering that that stench of
[SPEAKER_03]: shit would get them busted, they just all
maybe subconsciously bred away from the
[SPEAKER_03]: fiols and move towards the more aromatic
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's what happened to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not even telling people this,
but the purest indica, because I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to see their heads explode again,
really smells like fucking skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get dead skunk from my street.
[SPEAKER_03]: My dogs come home skunk sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lived with skunk since I was a little
kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have them in New England.
[SPEAKER_03]: Funny enough, though, they're only North
American animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no skunks in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And none of my this is what weirded me out
when guys like Ben were like, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: I called it skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Ben, you've never visited
America.
[SPEAKER_03]: How have you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked, have you ever seen a skunk
outside of Pepe Le Pew?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you mean a person?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you even have them at your zoos?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how would you know what a skunk smells
like?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you smelled a plant that smelled
nasty, like in the UK, they refer to it as
[SPEAKER_03]: cheese, because if you go to the UK and
you smell that nasty ass shit that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to eat and that nasty act,
I call it cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wouldn't call it a skunk because they
don't have skunks in England.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they wouldn't call it something they
don't have in the Netherlands either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes sense to an American when you
smell it, it smells like shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells like dead skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells accurate, rancid, nasty,
which also contains thiols in the skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: spray.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the relationship to me makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these, you know, the skunk one seeds
that I currently have, I have only been
[SPEAKER_03]: reproduced twice since the 1980s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Skunk man Sam gave them to Mel Frank in
1988.
[SPEAKER_03]: He put them in the refrigerator until 1996
and then reproduce them in 96.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put those reproductions in the
refrigerator and left them there until he
[SPEAKER_03]: took them out in 2019 and gave them to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started growing them out and realized
these things all still smell accurate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't smell sweet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did a selection of the most accurate
plants, filled my greenhouse, reproduced
[SPEAKER_03]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They came out great.
[SPEAKER_03]: People have been loving them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who don't grow them hate on me
and say I don't really have skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the people who do grow them love them
and say that skunk smells sweeter than
[SPEAKER_03]: these plants, one guy said.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get it though, because these
genetics are literally old.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're literally from the 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're literally from way back when.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got the ones from Greg.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, from what he says, from the
earlier 80s, they still have these thiols
[SPEAKER_03]: that are present.
[SPEAKER_03]: They still smell skunky to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that as we do more selections,
we are going to be able to bring the funk
[SPEAKER_03]: back in much of these Afghans if we're
looking for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're breeding towards flavor and taste
and trying to make dessert recipe type
[SPEAKER_03]: flavors, we're obviously going to move
away from thiols.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if people consciously do what I did,
which was throw out all the sweet plants
[SPEAKER_03]: and breed together all the stinky plants,
I think over time, just like we can
[SPEAKER_03]: manipulate terpene levels and cannabinoid
levels, we could manipulate thiol levels
[SPEAKER_03]: and raise them in future generations of
plants and kind of bring it back,
[SPEAKER_03]: bring it back, bring it back a little bit
at a time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's been an interesting journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when I first released Hayes,
I had a lot of people saying, you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: really have Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I released skunk one and,
oh, you really don't have skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody has skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And fortunately now with Northern Lights,
nobody's giving me a hard time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Greg is a little more active on social
media.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a little different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I had a lot of naysayers at first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even Skunkman Sam's been on shows like
Hashtard saying, yeah, Todd has my seats.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're real.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know why it's so hard for a
lot of people that don't want to believe
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a little ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually saw a disparaging comment by
what's the guy that got the, he got the
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom Hill Hayes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: He got the Positronic seeds in 1996.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he brought them home.
[SPEAKER_03]: He made some seeds and he named the Hayes
after himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was living practically at Posse.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had fucking keys in my own office at
Posse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I grew out those seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, they weren't that great
at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he bought them and thinks they're
awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I saw him on one of the forums
basically talking shit about, he doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: know what I have, but they can't be as
good as what he had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking really, I skipped over 10
years of Bernard's breeding and went right
[SPEAKER_03]: back to Skunkman Sam and got the original
Hayes seeds from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you think the ones that I got from Sam
are not as good as the ones you picked up
[SPEAKER_03]: from Positronics on a trip to high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I doubt honestly, that Tom picked up
thousands of original Hayes seed at
[SPEAKER_03]: Positronics at the time, because one,
we didn't sell them in very big packages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And two, most of the people there were not
buying thousands of seeds when they got
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have had thousands of original Hayes
seeds to do my selections through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would tend to believe it's like a
lottery ticket.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more lottery tickets you have,
the more of a chance you have to win.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you went home with even a hundred
seeds, I can't imagine how you would get
[SPEAKER_03]: selections as good as somebody who went
through thousands of seeds looking for a
[SPEAKER_03]: selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people want to,
I don't know, they get on a high horse and
[SPEAKER_03]: they really feel like they deserve credit
for things that really they don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because you went and bought some
seeds at Positronics, man, doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because you bought some seeds at
Positronics and mixed them together and
[SPEAKER_03]: then sold those seeds doesn't mean you're
doing anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like me, I am trying to not influence
the Hayes genetics in a sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am out crossing and making my own
varieties, but that's not original Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm trying to not fuck it up by
listening to Skunkman Sam and doing the
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding the way that he recommends I do
it, because I want other generations to
[SPEAKER_03]: get the opportunity to go through these
seeds as pure as possible and to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to find their own selections and hopefully
become great DJs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I'm feeling like I'm the
bridge between the older generation and
[SPEAKER_03]: the younger generation of newer breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like I'm the anti-cannabis,
cannabis company, because I'm really
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to get the genetics into the hands
of the community before these big
[SPEAKER_03]: corporates show up and try to turn it into
IP.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once they get their hands on a Purple
Passion or a fucking OG Kush, they're
[SPEAKER_03]: never going to release it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to cut clones and sell
them at the shop so you can grow the shit
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're selling, never in a million
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this genetic preservation is
super important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wish more people like Tom would say,
see that we're all trying to benefit the
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not a fucking quarter mile race.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about who's got the best of what.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, these are plants we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're all unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single plant in a sense is a unique
fingerprint on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't know its benefits until you
grow it out and experience it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wish more people would be
open-minded to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wish more people would kind of have
that open-minded approach to breeding and
[SPEAKER_03]: looking for the best quality and looking
for the best medicine rather than looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for an ego stroke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I can understand how understandably
frustrating it must have been to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with all the questions about validity
of stock and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's interesting and coincidental
you bring up Tom Hill, because I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: had a question I was going to ask you
about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may as well do it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the photos I've seen you post of the
Purest Indica, it looks obviously like
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights, but it also kind of
reminded me a bit of Deep Chunk with the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that resin's so thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell this has got some serious
Afghan hash plant-type vibes to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever grown out any of Tom's
lines, specifically the Deep Chunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not really his lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they are land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just because you bought some seeds
from Positronix doesn't mean you're
[SPEAKER_03]: working out land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is these Afghan genetics are
dominant in a lot of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Neville did a lot with Northern
Lights number two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern Lights number two is one of my
favorites right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so OG Kush, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked Greg years ago if he ever smoked
OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said to me, he said, yeah,
yeah, yeah, it's just NL2.
[SPEAKER_03]: He made a joke.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, Todd, we used to grow the NL5 and
sell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we used to grow the NL2 and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, oh, that's hilarious,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because the NL2 was funky and
heavy and fucking dank as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then the NL5 was more of that tropical
kind of light high, better yielding and
[SPEAKER_03]: shit like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So quicker growing because it had a little
more of the more tropical equatorial
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got what he meant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of this stuff, Neville was a
blessing, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville spread the seeds around.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Neville got these genetics into the
hands of many people.
[SPEAKER_03]: That then had an opportunity to breed with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: What Neville did was a beautiful thing for
the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he should always be revered for that
because it put the genetics into the hands
[SPEAKER_03]: of many people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it made a big difference in
the overall quality of cannabis in all
[SPEAKER_03]: reality by going through these selections
and getting these Afghans and different
[SPEAKER_03]: things out so that you can mix it with
your hazes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just an absolute blessing to the
world in the way of not having to go
[SPEAKER_03]: through land race tie or land race Afghan
or land race anything to start at the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom and try to work your way back up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sharing the genetics was like starting on
the top floor after all these people had
[SPEAKER_03]: done selections and breeding and made
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every single time, hopefully,
was an improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I think in a weird way,
the first wave of breeding was all about
[SPEAKER_03]: quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second wave of breeding was all about
quantity, meaning either quantity of seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: or the fastness and the amount of cannabis
you'd get in a short amount of time
[SPEAKER_03]: because people wanted that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted quick, they wanted heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't ask you for the highest
quality when you were selling seeds in
[SPEAKER_03]: Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody was like, it was the fastest,
heaviest yielder you got.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, okay, you want big bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who wants to smoke big bud?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I used to work for Simon at
Serious Seeds in the day, cleaning the
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Chronic was cool to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there was Chronic AK and Cali
sitting in front of me, I smoked the Cali,
[SPEAKER_03]: then I smoked the AK, and I'd probably
give away a little of Chronic.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that would be the last of the pots of
smoke because it was the least effective
[SPEAKER_03]: in my opinion, but it was the heaviest
yielder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big bud wasn't the biggest winner of any
of the cannabis cups I ever remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people went over there trying
to get big bud seeds because they wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: heavy, fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: The prohibition market demanded it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could turn over six crops a year in
your house, growing an eight week or you
[SPEAKER_03]: could turn four crops or even worse,
two crops a year growing something that
[SPEAKER_03]: was four to six months, what were you
going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pure economics drove the conversation to
where it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: The funny thing is, I always hoped to meet
Tom Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was younger, I had reverence for
all these breeders that I heard of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to the cannabis cup place to enjoy
meeting everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's got the highest THC game?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just about making friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a little bummed when I saw him
talking crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he has good genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he's done good selections.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he's put out some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had the opportunity to smoke weed
that he grew, I'd be happy about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to try some of Tom Hill's
haze and stuff, especially because I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been able to get original haze from
Skunkman Sam and grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've had great cuttings of
Neville's haze and smoked and loved it
[SPEAKER_03]: because I worked at Posi and was growing
fucking haze for the whole year of 1996.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to go through different varieties
to figure out which ones I like best.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of experience with it and I
would love to see his secondary color and
[SPEAKER_03]: what he's made with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Personally, I would rather have the seeds
that Sam keeps for himself and doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: sell to anybody than the seed you can buy
at Positronics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Personal preference, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm there with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You touched on OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'd be interested to hear a little
more about your thoughts on OG in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a strain you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you ever grow it and smoke it or do
you feel like it's just superseded by the
[SPEAKER_00]: ENL?
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll laugh, but when I got out of prison
in 2004, I didn't have any money in debt
[SPEAKER_03]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: My friends that grew OG Kush gave me back
because I had it before I went to prison
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They shared the clone with me prior to
prison, but I wasn't really talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't say they gave it to me,
but then when I got out of prison again,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was offered back to me again in 2004.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I got out of prison, I started Select
Strains, which was a little nursery and
[SPEAKER_03]: what is on the cover, but OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was my number one cutting, Sensei Star,
Super Silver Haze, Ronin Purple,
[SPEAKER_03]: and 39.
[SPEAKER_03]: I sold the shit out of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I was the very first person to
sell OG Kush cuttings in LA starting at
[SPEAKER_03]: the end of 2004, November, December.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably December 2004 was my first sale
of OG Kush cuttings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little later, maybe January,
but not much later after Christmas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Around that time, the guy that offered it
to me, I inquired to my friend who gave it
[SPEAKER_03]: to me and I went to him and said,
hey, may I sell cuttings of this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, I just didn't want to be an
asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came back to me and said, Todd,
the person who wanted you to have it,
[SPEAKER_03]: died and I don't think it matters.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do whatever you want with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, whoa, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't realize that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then years and years later, Adam Dunn had
a show that he was doing and he was
[SPEAKER_03]: letting people tell this real bullshit
story about the origin of OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, he had this guy that was
someone I knew and that snitched on me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was one of the government informants in
my case.
[SPEAKER_03]: His name was Dave.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've known Adam since 1994 and we're
friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam is from the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We both grew up a little bit in Rhode
Island.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're both smart asses.
[SPEAKER_03]: While the guy was talking, Adam joked with
him that, oh, you should have just went to
[SPEAKER_03]: the cops and told them that you only grew
it at one house and not all these other
[SPEAKER_03]: houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dumb son of a bitch said, I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I went to the DEA and told them I was only
growing a hair in Laurel Canyon and not to
[SPEAKER_04]: charge me with all these other houses.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always knew that he cooperated,
but I couldn't believe that he told on
[SPEAKER_04]: himself on Adam Dunn's show.
[SPEAKER_03]: After that happened, I heard from all
these people that were like, you got to
[SPEAKER_03]: listen to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just like, sweet Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when that happened, Josh D,
who's now pretty famous for being the guy
[SPEAKER_03]: from LA that had it.
[SPEAKER_03]: At that time, he was still underground
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: He hadn't made an Instagram for it or
anything and he contacted me.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said in a text message, how did you get
OG Kush?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't going to answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I called him on video and he answered.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, you tell me.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think you know me and you think you
know how I got it, you tell me who I got
[SPEAKER_03]: it through.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first name he mentioned, he got it
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, whoa, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it really somebody named Mad Dog?
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, Todd, that was my roommate.
[SPEAKER_03]: He held up this picture of his friend who
passed away from pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_03]: complications.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't know D or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a medical condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a really touching moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, Todd, he used to cut out articles
about you from the newspaper because this
[SPEAKER_03]: was before the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to put them on magnets on our
refrigerator so when I would come home
[SPEAKER_03]: from work, I could read the article about
you because we both thought what you were
[SPEAKER_03]: doing was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how in the 90s, he found out I had
friends and he got me a cutting through
[SPEAKER_03]: friends but I didn't know who it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't give me the nickname.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then after I got out of prison,
the same dude went through friends,
[SPEAKER_03]: different friends this time and offered it
back to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I would love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when I went back to ask, I found out
he passed away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then Josh put it all together for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The conversation I had with Josh was
really sincere.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no questioning Josh's
authenticity of what he was saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in LA at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew more than I should and that's why I
went to prison because I wouldn't talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't cooperate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just lock me up and that's what they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when I got out of prison,
all my friends were still there and I had
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing but love.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a lot of good things given back to
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my friends were still there when I
came home so it was really warm to come
[SPEAKER_03]: home to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I just got O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always been a fan of O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a go-to mine for medicine for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used it in that 2019 breeding against my
onhase.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's done really well for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: People seem to really love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I have Northern Life No.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 and I just did a greenhouse run of
Northern Life No.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2, I can absolutely see who the mommy
daddy of the O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush was.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I spoke to the guy who supposedly
originally made the seeds in Florida that
[SPEAKER_03]: the cutting came from, he told me that in
89, we went to the Netherlands and we
[SPEAKER_03]: bought Hindu Kush and Northern Light seeds
from Nepal.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it can be because when I talked
to him, I said, man, I think it's Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: Lights because I remembered.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first experience with O.G.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush was in 1997 when I came back from
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I smoked it in January of 97,
I was like, oh, this is Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_03]: because I had just come back from hanging
out with Alan Droppers and going to the
[SPEAKER_03]: castle in 96.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being there, smoking Northern Lights
varieties that they had, stuff that they
[SPEAKER_03]: agreed with, the stuff that they grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to smoke a lot of different shit
with Alan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan's a real pothead.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alan loves to smoke, loves his hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's really into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had the opportunity of sleeping over
at the castle and getting high with Alan
[SPEAKER_03]: all night long and smoking the stuff that
was in the basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I'm very fortunate to have the
experience that I've had.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the cannabis that I've been around.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I got here and smoked it,
I just thought it was Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then when I asked Greg about it,
he reinforced that, yeah, it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that I've grown it, I definitely think
the parents were Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I think that in phylos,
if in the six different types or five
[SPEAKER_03]: different types that they list out,
because they list out wild, berry,
[SPEAKER_03]: skunk, and something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is Oji Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that was Northern Lights, then it would
make sense for me because there'd be
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern Lights and Skunk One and then all
the other things that came from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: To put Oji Kush up there with Skunk One,
when there's 20 years, you got to go back
[SPEAKER_03]: to the 70s if you're really going to get
under the varieties that we have now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those don't go to Oji Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go back to the Steve Murphy Purist
Indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen the book?
[SPEAKER_03]: The book I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen the picture I mean?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the genetics don't lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you look at the photo, when you look
at the 1975 photo, it's like freaking
[SPEAKER_03]: twins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it looks the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my mind then asks the question,
I'm not sure how familiar you are in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of growing out the different chem dog
varieties, but the same sort of question
[SPEAKER_00]: often lingers around chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think there's NL in that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've often thought chem 91, they call it,
and Oji Kush are closely related without
[SPEAKER_03]: question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also grown stuff that came from the
hog farm, the wavy gravy, Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: California, and it was very Northern
Lights as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, Northern Lights number two is the
mystery between Afghan, because it was an
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I asked him what Northern Lights
number two was, he said it was mixed with
[SPEAKER_03]: the Afghans that they got from Oregon and
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he said and California, it made me
think, okay, this makes more sense,
[SPEAKER_03]: because if you have zero mixed with a
California or Oregon Afghan, and then you
[SPEAKER_03]: take number one, because that becomes
number one, and then you mix that with a
[SPEAKER_03]: California Afghan or Oregon Afghan,
you get NL number two, you're still pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: close to that Purist Indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: As they were bumping up that where,
in Greg's opinion, it was simply growth
[SPEAKER_03]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: The leaves became narrower, the plants
became taller, the finishing times grew
[SPEAKER_03]: longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just numbered them from closest to
Murphy's Afghan to the most tropical ones
[SPEAKER_03]: that he had.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you think about it, it makes sense
why none of the numbers over five really
[SPEAKER_03]: became popular to Neville, because
Neville, once he got those male hazes,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything was with the male hazes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's as if he didn't have any other haze
plants to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says he had a female, but he says he
killed it because it wasn't that good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe he actually had it,
to be really honest with you, but it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the conversation,
he stated many times that he only had two
[SPEAKER_03]: males.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that that's why, in a sense,
you get just a limited amount of secondary
[SPEAKER_03]: colors from what he could do with that
primary color, because if those haze males
[SPEAKER_03]: were his primaries, it would have a good
signature on every other color he mixed it
[SPEAKER_03]: with, just to use an analogy that people
that maybe don't breed can easily
[SPEAKER_03]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if he had a female, he would have
definitely made F2s and hunted through
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and we would have heard about it,
but interesting nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been having so much fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We skipped over the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We normally jump back to it around 15
minutes in, but we ask everyone,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom was a hippie, and I was going
through chemotherapy and radiation,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I have a big scar on the side of my
body.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a tumor between my left lung and my
heart for the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had it in soft tissue, only it was
inside a bone marrow, and it would break
[SPEAKER_03]: my bone.
[SPEAKER_03]: My spine is fused.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had three locations in my skull.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two more in my right ear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two locations in my left hip.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in a wheelchair for over six months
when I was a little kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then after all that, I got it again
between my left lung and my heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom had read in Good Housekeeping that
cannabis was being used for cancer
[SPEAKER_03]: patients, and she inquired with my
pediatrician, and he felt like,
[SPEAKER_03]: man, you have nothing to lose,
Anne.
[SPEAKER_03]: She, being a hippie, already had weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we drove home that day, she had me
slip down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was only nine years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had me slip down into the front seat
of the car, and she had the air
[SPEAKER_03]: conditioning on.
[SPEAKER_03]: She gave me a joint, and she told me to
sip it like it was a straw.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got down in the little thing,
and I was sipping it like it was a straw.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started giddling and feeling pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mind you, I just went through chemo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only went through chemo, I went
through radiation therapy because I was
[SPEAKER_03]: getting chemical therapy, and then they
were sending me to radiation, so it really
[SPEAKER_03]: sucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we got home that day, I wanted
spinach.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a big Popeye fan, and I wanted
sauteed spinach and butter.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom was high and thought, what would I
do to my kid?
[SPEAKER_03]: She called my pediatrician, and he said,
feed him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tomorrow, don't give him any and see if
it's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next day, we drove home, and it
sucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got home, and I was being sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was up in my room, fucking crying and
puking and having a fucking moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: She came up with a joint and said,
hey, sip it like it's a straw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's try this again.
[SPEAKER_03]: We sat on the floor in my bedroom,
and I had a Don McLean American Pie 45,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you'd have to flip the fucking song
over halfway through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and my mom said, I was out there,
and she had a joint, and I had a joint,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was smoking it, getting high,
and I got so high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so into the song, and she hated it
because they sing, now is a good day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's the day I'm going to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom, fucking nine-year-old with cancer,
fucking rock it out to this, we're all
[SPEAKER_03]: going to die song, but it's an American
anthem, and I loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just really amusing, and that was
my first real experience with my mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it saved my life, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turned me into an avid student.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am grateful to this day, to her giving
it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a beautiful, touching story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for sharing that with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it progress from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you start, as usual, smoking as a
teenager?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you develop the urge to first
grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in a twist of fate, I started
smoking pot, and I stopped smoking pot
[SPEAKER_03]: after the cancer for a while, but then
when I was 12, my stepdad was a biker,
[SPEAKER_03]: a big six-foot-five monster, tattoos down
to his wrist, and harleys and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was eight, I got a motorcycle,
and when I was 12, I got another
[SPEAKER_03]: motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a helmet on, and my spine is fused.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first five vertebrae fused solid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a 12-year-old kid riding trails on a
motorcycle that was too big for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I weighed 70 pounds, and they gave me 100
cc Suzuki TS100.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just a terror, and my head would be
bouncing around, and it started to hurt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was in seeing my doctor, and I said,
hey, you got to give me something for my
[SPEAKER_03]: neck.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, your neck's fused, and it's not
going to get better.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I can prescribe for you is
opiates, and they'll become physically or
[SPEAKER_03]: mentally addicted, and it'll ruin your
life, and I'm not going to do it,
[SPEAKER_03]: so you got to learn how to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, that sucks, and I was 12.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, shit, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, well, you could try smoking your
mom's pot, and I was just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: ha-ha.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, no, I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are my help.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 1982, and probably October.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to my mom and was like,
hey, Peter, Peter Smith was my
[SPEAKER_03]: pediatrician.
[SPEAKER_03]: He told me maybe I could smoke some pot,
and it would help my neck feel better.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was like, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, ask him, and so she did.
[SPEAKER_03]: She believed me, though, and she gave me
some on the spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did have a conversation about it when
we went back to the hospital, because if I
[SPEAKER_03]: had lied, it would have been the end of
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we got there, she said, did you tell
him to smoke pot?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, yeah, how did it work out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you try it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it was just like, okay, you weren't
full of shit, because how many doctors
[SPEAKER_03]: back then were brave enough?
[SPEAKER_03]: He had been my pediatrician since I was
two or three years old, so he had such a
[SPEAKER_03]: close relationship with me and my family.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom and dad were bikers, so they
weren't exactly going to go to the cops.
[SPEAKER_03]: They may have been outlaws, but you could
trust them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that sounds funny to say,
but there was dignity within that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was cool with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started getting bags of weed from my
mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was sworn to secrecy, unfortunately,
but I stopped with all the big kids,
[SPEAKER_03]: because all the kids who had motorcycles
were fucking 17, 18, 16 at least,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I was just the odd man out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I walked up to them, and they had a little
bag of brown pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never saw a brown pot before in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom never had brown weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, why is it brown?
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, because it comes that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, does it grow that way?
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, what do you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had gotten a 20 bag from my mom that
day, and I had rolled a couple of joints,
[SPEAKER_03]: split it in half, left half of it at home,
took half of it with me in case I wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: more weed, and took the two joints with
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went back and grabbed the little half a
bag of weed, which is now like a $6 bag of
[SPEAKER_03]: pot, and a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lit it, and I passed it around to all
the big kids, and every one of them
[SPEAKER_03]: started coughing their ass off.
[SPEAKER_03]: My one friend was like, as he's coughing,
he was like, whoa, this is what it's
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to feel like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just really hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: The kid John next to me was just like,
where did you get this pot?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, will you sell it to me?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, how much will you give me?
[SPEAKER_03]: He was like, if I gave you $20,
would you feel like I ripped you off?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, no, I'll sell you that for $20.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got more than twice that in two joints
for $20 because it was a 20 bag because my
[SPEAKER_04]: mom was a dealer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just was like, oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right when I did that, my big friend said,
can I get one too?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the other half at home, and I was
like, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He only lived three houses away from my
grandma.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was it, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: From that day on, I became my neighborhood
pot dealer.
[SPEAKER_03]: My poor mom, dude, I went back to her that
night after hitting her up for a bag that
[SPEAKER_03]: day and said, can I get another bag of
pot?
[SPEAKER_03]: She goes, oh honey, I can't just keep
giving you bags of pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, because now I had like 40
bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought gas, which my gas tank didn't
even hold a gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear gas was like 60 cents back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: I brought my friend to Friendly's and I
treated, and I think I spent $4.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got burgers and fries and sodas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was $4.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 1982.
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom looked at me and I was like,
can I just buy it?
[SPEAKER_04]: The look on her face was sheer fucking
horror, but she's like, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, cool, can I pick?
[SPEAKER_04]: She was like, I put the $20 down and I
went to go get the bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: She knew it was like, this is not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started selling pots to my friends and
it worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the time I was like, 12 years old and
six months, I was probably selling like
[SPEAKER_03]: $200 worth of weed to my local friends,
you know, cause I buy an ounce and I'd
[SPEAKER_03]: split it into four bags and sell them from
40 each.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get like 160 per ounce for like a
quarter ounce, you know, for 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I never sold joints.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would only give them away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause when people ask me for joints,
I always felt bad that they couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: afford a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just give them a giant, give them a
hug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I felt like there was karma in the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt like if you were given away
joints and somewhere somebody was like
[SPEAKER_03]: lighting up the joint that they couldn't
help, but to think good thoughts of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like you just have to have the joint
free, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I don't know, like I felt like
if a lot of people were thinking good
[SPEAKER_03]: thoughts of you, that your life would be a
little bit better is what at the time my
[SPEAKER_03]: thought process was with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, and then I went to sell a bag of
weed to my friend's older brother.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was all of like 19 at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we got to his house, he had a Mel
Frank grow book and he had, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: he had built, he was a construction
worker.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he built like this plywood closet and
his living room where most normal people
[SPEAKER_03]: would have a television.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like four feet, maybe four and
a half feet wide, uh, cause he had four
[SPEAKER_03]: foot lamps in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then he, it was like maybe 18 to 30
inches off the wall and it had doors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he opened it and I saw her
plants, they're growing with the
[SPEAKER_03]: fluorescent light.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like the color version of the,
you know, that fucking, um, the Emerald
[SPEAKER_03]: brick road.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the wizard of our, I was like,
well, they show color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the first time, but like my whole
life changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, I was fucking floored,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I traded them the $20 bag of weed
for that Mel Frank row book.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went home, I cleaned out my closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already had seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found the pots, the, the clothing lines
that I used to hang the lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found the fluorescent light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I found the timer all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was all my grandma's.
[SPEAKER_03]: My grandmother had the light in the
basement, the timer in the front window.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had the pots in the soil in the shed
where she used to keep her pots in her
[SPEAKER_03]: soil and her watering can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I fucking dude, it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I grew pot for like a year until my
grandma caught me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when she caught me, it was fucking
cute as fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause she came up, like I used to have my
light cycle eight to eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when I was at school, it'd be dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, so she comes up at like seven 59
and 55 seconds and the lights glowing in
[SPEAKER_03]: the closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she goes to touch me and the timer
clicked off and she freaking loses it
[SPEAKER_03]: saying someone's in your closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's in your closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, nobody's in my closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was like, show me.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she pushes me towards the closet and I
slide it open and I reached down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as soon as I clicked the timer,
she heard the sound of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: She goes, Hey, that's my timer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the lights flickered on and she
goes, those are my fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she looks down and I had like these
cool clay plots of hers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she's like, those are my pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my watering can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, Graham, the only thing I
had to go by was the, was the potting was
[SPEAKER_04]: the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've been dying to tell you why all of
your house plants are dying.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because you're not fertilizing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was just like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the plants were like six feet high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I didn't know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just raising the light as they
would grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there she was like four foot 11.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's Italian.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she like, looks at this and she's
like, they were bigger than her,
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were in bud and the leaves were
huge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was like, do you bring these
outside?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: She goes, they grow under these
fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, yeah, I was really surprised
myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was like, couldn't believe I did
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like she just couldn't,
she couldn't, she like, cause they were
[SPEAKER_03]: clearly had been there for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I left that day with the deal that she
wouldn't hurt my plants while I was in
[SPEAKER_03]: school.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I came home and I was like,
yo, what's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said, I think they need more room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Oh, so she let me put them
downstairs.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had me lay down a pallet, put my pots
on the pallet so they wouldn't be on the
[SPEAKER_03]: concrete.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then she let me use some of her old
drapes that had white vinyl on the inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hung it to the exposed wood and I
hung the fan up top and I had my
[SPEAKER_03]: fluorescent lights there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she started watering the plants when
she would do the wash and then they
[SPEAKER_03]: finished.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had my first growers dispute ever
because I like one in the morning,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all stoned and I can cut the plants
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next morning I go down there and
my grandma's mad and she's in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, what's the matter?
[SPEAKER_03]: She goes, what did you do to those plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, Oh, I harvested them.
[SPEAKER_03]: She goes, you killed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, well, that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kill them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, she goes, where are they now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, they're hanging upstairs in my
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_03]: She goes, she just killed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she goes, well, what do you do now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I plant some more seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: She said, and start all over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she was like, Oh God, Todd,
I can't, you should have left a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: She goes, I've been taking care of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, and I realized at that
moment how attached she had came to him
[SPEAKER_03]: and I felt so bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really cute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after that, I did my first cutting in
the kitchen with my grandma.
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually put it in a napkin with a
powder like Hormex.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still use it to this day, number eight.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had been around since she was younger.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I put in rooting powder, put it in the
napkin and we had it like in a little
[SPEAKER_03]: like, in a little, she had saucers for her
tea and she'd put a little water in the
[SPEAKER_03]: saucer and left it right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fucking roots grew right through
the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I started doing cuttings
way back, way back in 1984 with my
[SPEAKER_03]: grandma.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really cool, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, other than going to prison,
I've never stopped growing since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a fantastic, like real organic sort
of story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and your grandma grew together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: She took my Pringles can cause I used to
have these, they like chips that come in
[SPEAKER_03]: America called Pringles and they,
they come in a can.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have been very much like this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your chips are all like perfectly
formed and they don't get crushed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really funny because I had
Pringles cans full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause when I get popped with seeds,
I would take the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just sell the weed to my friends
because they didn't want seeds and it
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't look good in my bags.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I collected all these seeds and she,
she snatched one of my Pringles cans and
[SPEAKER_03]: she had a garden outside of her window
where she'd have roses grow up and then
[SPEAKER_03]: she'd prune all the roses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they all came just to the height of her
window.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when she had opened her window,
it'd be all roses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: She was like really good at gardening,
you know, but you have to realize she was
[SPEAKER_03]: born in 1911 and her big like
technological advancement when she was a
[SPEAKER_03]: little girl was her house got electricity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to put it in perspective and she
grew, she grew her food in the backyard
[SPEAKER_03]: and they, they, they had to understand
food preservation and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation was a part of human existence
to her.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she's the one who taught me how to grow
a garden in our backyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and she's really where all of this
came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I will give her credit forever for
turning me onto this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really cool of her.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but she took my Pringles can and
turned the ground and then sprinkled
[SPEAKER_03]: these, these cannabis seeds, like
broadcast style all there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm in the backyard selling my friend
a bag of weed and goes, dude, you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to get caught.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went like, I thought he meant
selling in the bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, what are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, dude, all these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I looked down and they were all like
knee high, because as they grew up,
[SPEAKER_03]: my grandmother would take her hedger and
just sniff them like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: with the hedger, snip, snip, snip,
snip, snip.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she had a little, like it was probably
a high hundred something little plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, or more, but it was like,
it looked like a little green hedge,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, cause she was just like,
she did her roses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just, I went inside and was
like, grandma, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's like, don't you touch those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, grandma, you're going to
get us in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, you can't just be growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like, why?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, grandma, is he legal?
[SPEAKER_04]: She goes, oh plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, this is going to be kind
of hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, cause she just couldn't
wrap her head around the idea that a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: was illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like she was like the drugs illegal,
but the plant, like, what are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, and it was funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she did cut them down, but she was
pissy about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't until I showed my mom and my
stepdad and, and they all were like,
[SPEAKER_03]: man, you got to cut these plants down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then she was just like, she was hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: She was just a cool old lady, but you
know, it was, it was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my first traffic ticket when I was
12 years old speeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing 70 on the sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got arrested.
[SPEAKER_03]: They towed my motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they took me to the police
station, they made me call my parents and
[SPEAKER_03]: I live with my grandma.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I called my grandma and she drove a 69
Pontiac Firebird with like a souped up
[SPEAKER_03]: 350.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hugger orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: My, my, my stepdad gave it to her because
he thought that his mother-in-law drive in
[SPEAKER_03]: a fast muscle car would be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he gave her a fast muscle car.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sitting in a police station.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm 12 and, and the cop hears the car pull
up and he goes, who'd you call?
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, call my grandma.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he opens the door and there's this
little, little lady standing in front of
[SPEAKER_03]: this fucking sixties muscle car.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says, is that your car?
[SPEAKER_03]: And she goes, you got a problem with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was like, Oh, this is definitely
your grandson.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had to come in and he says,
she was doing 70 on the sidewalk.
[SPEAKER_03]: She goes, I don't think his motorcycle can
go that fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, I had it on radar.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, I'd have to see the radar
lady.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, I was sitting there
laughing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just like, that was my grandpa.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, she was just, she was just
nails, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was adorable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I'm grateful for her to this day,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's funny, cause I started growing
pot in 1982, 19, well, it was 1983,
[SPEAKER_03]: technically the end of 83, the beginning
of 84.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and 13 years later, I was living in a
Bel Air mansion, growing fucking 4,000
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana plants with fucking,
you know, a staff of six.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of think, you know,
how weird it is to go from living on,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like welfare, cause I was a
preexisting medical condition and we were
[SPEAKER_03]: poor as dirt, you know, to like living in
one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the
[SPEAKER_03]: United States, you know, growing thousands
of cannabis plants in your own home.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, I would never have expected that my
little closet garden could end up,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to the places that it's brought
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what a wild journey it's been.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what'd you think guys?
