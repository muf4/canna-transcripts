himself, James Bean of Seeds here now,
[SPEAKER_05]: to talk all things seeds, industry,
and predictions for the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: So without further ado, let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty, it's that time again,
my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: A big thank you and a big welcome to the
one and only, true Mr. Wonka.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so very much, James.
[SPEAKER_05]: James Bean for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing good, my friend.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to be alive and good to be in
the industry, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amen to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's start off with our normal first
question these days.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you currently smoking on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, earlier I was smoking, I'll admit
it, I was smoking some of the cacacush.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brown frown, as it were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found some brown frown, but I ran myself
out of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been smoking on some dry sift
I got from Exotic, the strawberries and
[SPEAKER_00]: cream F2 dry sift.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you just dab in that one or put it on
top of a cone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, I don't have anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran myself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did put some, I didn't want to put it on
the cacacush because that wouldn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: help it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've just been dabbing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can't even elevate the trash with
the gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it tarnishes the gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you want to ruin it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen that one pop up a fair bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's it taste like?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the high like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, strawberries and cream or cacacush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cacacush gives you a fucking headache if
you miss a seed or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberries and cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberries and cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can definitely taste the
sweetness of the strawberries in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is pretty odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Exotic's been working on it for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know he's real proud of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just been bonkers over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was nice enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gifted me a couple of sifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the nice thing about Mike is that
before his line will drop, he will,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike from Exotic Genetics, but he will
give like when I meet up with him a month
[SPEAKER_00]: beforehand or whatever, I'll get like
flowers and I'll get dry sift of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product that he drops in a month,
which means to me that tells me right off
[SPEAKER_00]: the bat, boom, this guy's already grown
all this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's already happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's already seen it all flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, you know, he's given me the
flower as he's releasing the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that's, that's a credit
to his part.
[SPEAKER_00]: He definitely tests all the stuff where he
runs it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mike's also one of those guys I've
noticed who is always continually pushing
[SPEAKER_05]: forward with projects.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something I like a lot,
you know, like he doesn't let things get
[SPEAKER_05]: stagnant and start to just sit there and
redo the same releases again and again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely leaving this in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was just saying, yeah, like Mike's
always moving forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you feel like that's a trait like a lot
of successful breeders embody or is it
[SPEAKER_05]: possible to just kind of make your
releases a bit more slow and spaced out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, it really depends on the breeder
to be honest, because I mean, you could,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's Mike who definitely works on stuff
for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice thing is I was part of,
I ended up with 360 when I was in
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington and I would get their tests and
I would see everybody was running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, man, why are you running a
citrus thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, six months later it comes out
with citric, but he was just sitting in
[SPEAKER_00]: samples trying to get, you know,
turps and profiles and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but then at the same time,
there's, there's like a, there's Odie
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesel from homegrown natural wonders who
doesn't have a lot of releases,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when he does, it's, it's tried and
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Odie will walk around with 10 jars
with him, trying to figure out which one
[SPEAKER_00]: is his best, his best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll sample it with everybody that he
knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've, you know, when he figured
out which one he likes, boom, that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's the way to release.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, and so I think that's a credit to
both of their, those, those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, when I talk to people that work with
Mike or have worked with Mike in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always, one thing that comes up with
them is he's, he's got the eye,
[SPEAKER_00]: like he can in a room full of,
full of, in a room full of bitches in a
[SPEAKER_00]: room full of girls, uh, he can pick out
the fiery one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, that is a skill in itself,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Either that or on a room full of dicks,
you can pick out the best one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So either way you look at it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: Another very admirable breeder trait.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just in general, what's new in the
world of James Bean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, uh, a lot and not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just getting ready to go to Portland
tomorrow while we're doing the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Indo Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always a fun show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, done is broadcasting from there
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, tomorrow we'll be on the floor,
hitting the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fly out tomorrow morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be a cool weekend show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going back to Medford to,
uh, run down my office and then I'll come
[SPEAKER_00]: back to San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then of course we've got,
uh, upcoming shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the Miami show coming up,
the big, uh, the big industry show,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, September 23rd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down in Miami.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big retail show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What, what's the Florida same like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, Canada back, back when they had
like a couple of years ago when they,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they passed laws in Florida,
just because cannabis didn't pass because
[SPEAKER_00]: it has this, this crazy percentage that it
needs in order to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's two thirds majority,
but just because cannabis didn't pass CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: did pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they've been growing it,
but they, their first restrictions were
[SPEAKER_00]: very weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you had to, the place that your
facility had to have been an operation for
[SPEAKER_00]: like 40 years and it had to have shown
that it would, you know, it could produce
[SPEAKER_00]: at least 400,000 plants or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had to have been owned by the same
person for the past 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that, that kind of bias and
horrible as it even is, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: that gives us a certain amount of people,
a certain shot at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems very limiting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, do you feel like there will be a
more full scale rollout of legalization
[SPEAKER_05]: eventually down there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there has to be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that, that weird law is just too
weird and too selective of a very short
[SPEAKER_00]: minority of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not, it's, it's not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there, there has to be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go down to like Key West,
uh, two years ago, I went from coast to
[SPEAKER_00]: coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drove from coast to coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started Key West, but when you go down
there, there's, there's hot t-shirts
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere and all the, on all the vendors
are selling, you know, get high,
[SPEAKER_00]: get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one smoke shop, but,
uh, but just t-shirts everywhere and the
[SPEAKER_00]: culture was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think, I don't see why not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the also the tourism boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Florida, you can, everybody that gets
on and off those cruise ships as a
[SPEAKER_00]: customer, so to say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, on that same train of thought,
what state do you think will be the next
[SPEAKER_05]: to fall and to kind of open the flood
gates for it all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many that are just,
that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and now that the sessions are out,
they're not really, um, they're not really
[SPEAKER_00]: passing anything, but I, I, because,
you know, I think, um, a couple of months
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, one state just went and did their own
bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And acted their own stuff and got,
and got, got with the times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's not going to be Idaho.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sadly, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think Idaho has some of the best
climate to grow that, uh, our Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis end, but just not the right
people, not the right people at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they made a law against ever making a
law positive about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got, they're surrounded by legal
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean when Utah passes ahead of
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a bit weird, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean, they do their own thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to kind of jump back on track,
let's dig back into the past for a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure I asked you this in our first
interview, so I want to bring it up now.
[SPEAKER_05]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I thought, I thought we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I was basically, uh, hustling QPs a
shake and the joints they bring us,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, maybe the place of education daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would just sell them off and I
was actually hustling them off before I
[SPEAKER_00]: even started smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't smoke until like my senior year
of high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but it was just, uh, with some
friends, I'm sure in the back of a blazer
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have any bong waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: She used iced tea, you know, that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it at lunchtime and we got,
we got really stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we were, we had Beasters,
which I come to now Noah's M39,
[SPEAKER_00]: but through that back then it was
Beasters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll smell like, Hey, I was like,
Oh, they must grow this in a hayfield as I
[SPEAKER_00]: got educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh no, that's just more than
you're smelling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what was the experience like?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you get high on your first time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you say that they say the short term
memory goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't really remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Must've been pretty good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I continued down the path.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what was the progression next from
just, you know, getting some stuff to some
[SPEAKER_05]: mates at school.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did you then progress to become the
giant of the seed world?
[SPEAKER_05]: We know you to be now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's, let's, let's pause on that,
on that note, pause, but keep rolling if
[SPEAKER_00]: you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, who is James Bean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I am, uh, a nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I'm flattered that, that you even,
uh, you have me on your show twice now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sponsor, so I guess that helps,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, to have me on your show that,
and Carol, my opinions aren't in things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was lucky enough to get to find you
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the questions I thought you asked were
on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I was like, I, the way I explain
people, I was like, he either doesn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: things or he's fucking got huge balls,
but he just, he asked questions that you
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, and so I appreciate that
about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you were getting, you know,
let's get to the bottom of shit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you were concise about it,
but, um, uh, I got lost my train of
[SPEAKER_00]: thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were going with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, who am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who am I?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a nobody, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a broker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's nice to, uh, uh, to hear all
this and see all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I think what people sometimes,
uh, misinterpret is that I have anything
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with the seed production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a broker who helps, uh, breeders get
their, get their genetics out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've got great customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a great worth ethic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got great, um, ethical tendencies,
I guess you want to say morals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so if I, with our satisfaction
guarantee, if you ever buy anything and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're unhappy with it, for whatever
reason, you know, if King Kong comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sky and breaks your fucking plants,
you think it's my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, call us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk to you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send you a free five pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we want everybody to be satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, the, um, we have, uh,
1600, uh, five star reviews on our
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least we've, uh, that like I said,
outstanding customer service, but I never
[SPEAKER_00]: want anybody to go to Facebook and start
to ratten or say anything or say that
[SPEAKER_00]: this, we did them wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never want anybody to have the ability
to say that I didn't, I didn't do them
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't take care of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then on behalf of the breeders,
it's always, it's never, it's never a good
[SPEAKER_00]: question to ask a customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how did you, how did you
germinate those?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as it is, um, we sell souvenir packs
and so we don't speak to germination
[SPEAKER_00]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're unsatisfied with your packs,
get ahold of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make sure you're happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, really solid sentiment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, who on earth would go to
Facebook and start trashing you before
[SPEAKER_05]: they contact you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It never ceases to exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, they think they're going to get
more that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if they think they are squeaky wheel,
I'm not sure where they, what they think,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, they shouldn't know by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think any company, you don't
just, when you're pissed off at Sears and
[SPEAKER_00]: Roebuck or you go buy a Bose system at
Sears and it doesn't work and you bring it
[SPEAKER_00]: back, you don't want to go start trashing
Sears.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this industry, it's a little
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I sold them packs at Hermi dial and
they're upset about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, no, I, I didn't,
I didn't make shit of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I'll, I'll fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll replace it and make sure you're
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe put you in with a different breeder,
but it's not my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let me, you can yell at me all you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can yell at my customer service,
but we didn't, we didn't breed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're simply going to just stand by them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Solid ethos, solid ethos.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, to jump back to that question,
what was the progression from,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, Mr. Wonka to where you are now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go back, back on, back on course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a DJ for 15 years, 95 through
2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I played records and vinyl kind of
back in the day when it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of an underground thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I was known for notorious for,
for, for weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I flew around, I always had to
have like, you know, a quarter and eighth
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting for me at the, where I was flying
or whoever picked me up from the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had to make sure there was trapped
with weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got there, um, uh, I just came,
you know, I'd smoke on stage, a real world
[SPEAKER_00]: record.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so that was all, all fun and dandy,
um, in 2010, I, uh, the scene kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: changed and it went to Mr. Rags,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you could buy your little rave gear in
the stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, you know, the thing that was
underground and kind of cool kind of got
[SPEAKER_00]: blown out of proportion and everybody and
their fucking brother was in it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it wasn't cool to me anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of my friends that I had gone at,
you know, started DJing with back in
[SPEAKER_00]: Boise, Idaho, he was now, uh, he'd already
come through Portland.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd always, you know, I'd stop and talk
with him and he'd be in the center of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook stuff about how he was in
Breeder, uh, your diaries and he was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: all this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I had an ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, this guy doesn't
know more than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I met up with him at a show,
uh, that played here and he busted out
[SPEAKER_00]: some cannabis and it was fucking
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got me super stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, he, he dropped the
knowledge and schooled me and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: damn, that's, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do to, you know, DJ scenes,
killing it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I do to get in the green scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, well, I'm Breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, you could sell a shit for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, with a napkin,
I bought Washington's the right to
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: States phone from him, um, started to
watch WAC bank, uh, out of my,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, just doing trade shows, uh,
hemp festival.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my first show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that progressed to my friend
Hoffa, uh, pushing me to get a website and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd have a web platform to a Shopify site
to my original manager, rebuilding a
[SPEAKER_00]: WordPress site to another site,
to another site, which brings us to our
[SPEAKER_00]: latest site.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've learned that, um, with websites,
uh, it's best to have a team, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: to do these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when you call somebody's not at
their cousin's birthday this weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it doesn't have family in town or,
you know, when you are, when the website
[SPEAKER_00]: goes down, which, you know, I want to
thank all of our customers for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuck with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the website shit's been a pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest with you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you sticking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a killer sale right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of a way to say thanks for
sticking in there with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause these last four months we've gone
through four different websites being shut
[SPEAKER_00]: down targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I went with the firm, um,
forked over a lot of dough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the new website will, uh, not gonna
jinx myself, but, uh, by September 1st
[SPEAKER_00]: should be up and functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, since the last time I talked to you,
I might've mentioned a form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that, that little dream of mine came
true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I got my form up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it's got, uh, it's got a chat room
on the top where you guys can chat back
[SPEAKER_00]: and forth on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a breeder pages where you can go
into each breeder's page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each breeder has their own facts section,
their own strain section, their own,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, general section where they can
announce their, their, their giveaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so you can go in there and ask a
breeder, get one-on-one contact with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's also, you know, it was set up on
our servers so it'll never go down and
[SPEAKER_00]: never be, you know, taken out or,
uh, subpoenaed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean that you guys have gone through
an unfortunate amount of kind of attacks
[SPEAKER_05]: on the site.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do you think that is?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, why do you think you,
cause I don't hear, are the sea banks
[SPEAKER_05]: complaining about their websites being
taken down and stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think it's just like, uh,
you're an easy target cause you guys are
[SPEAKER_05]: so far the biggest?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I never wanted to be the big
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, kind of just, you know, with,
uh, I don't know dope, dope your
[SPEAKER_00]: terminology or thinking you kind of,
you know, you never want to be the bright
[SPEAKER_00]: shiny guy on the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kind of just keeps yourself and don't
show you got a lot of shit and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: won't be having no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so when people reference us as one
of the biggest, it kind of still shocks me
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, it still wonders me,
but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I know is that, uh, we've been
attacked a couple of times and there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one time on four 20,
we got 17,000 comments per hour or
[SPEAKER_00]: something that said, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four 20, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you not to fuck with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you not to fuck with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in code, like just 17,000 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, you know, two years ago we
were, we were ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were prepared for the four,
four, four 20 attack this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had people on standby.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had four 20 cyber on standby to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got attacked again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're attacking us from, of course,
Russian sites using tour and audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's not, you know, I'm told
there's nothing you can do besides defend
[SPEAKER_00]: against it, yada, yada, but it's been a
pain in the ass.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that this type of practice is
going to become more and more common?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who's doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our customers, you know, obviously you
don't have an issue to be upset with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an issue, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some ex breeders, I don't know if they
have an issue with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I'm, I'm just, uh,
I'm just the face, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: of a much bigger company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a team that works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 13 people that work full time that
I employ, um, along with 40 breeders that
[SPEAKER_00]: I represent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, uh, when people attack my
website, cause they just like me,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, Hey, you know, you're also
fucking with 40 dudes, website incomes and
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 families.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, if you had an issue with me,
just take it up with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, what it is or why I,
um, I wish, I wish I knew.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Understandably frustrating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, why don't we move on to some more
kind of brighter pastures?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's chat about the newest breeder
on the block.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen about two days ago, a very big
name brand joined the seeds here now
[SPEAKER_05]: roster.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to tell us a little bit more
about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a guy, Jackson Zentner, AKA meme gene,
AKA freeborn selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the guy is, uh, is, uh, I think I've
said in the past pops more beans than I
[SPEAKER_00]: think anybody else does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he probably pops a five gallon
bucket full of beans looking for Finos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he really works his plants,
his lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working with him for about two
and a half, three years now trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: him on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember him calling me and asking,
we talked for an hour about his real,
[SPEAKER_00]: his launches release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been wanting his root beer for
about two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, we've got sky color Kush and
we got pina colada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're happy to start with those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, of course we'll get more as time goes,
but yeah, Jackson was a big pickup.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really solid guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like, I really like working with
those type of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and definitely a guy who knows
about the plant and loves the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, he's one of those names that
frequently gets mentioned alongside the
[SPEAKER_05]: likes of Duke diamond and many other in
that tier one category.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess my first question is how quickly
do you expect that drop to sell out?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I can only imagine you've got what
seconds when it goes live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it, uh, should hopefully go pretty
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're in the middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people have already got
their, their, their strains in the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that we only had a two day,
a two day, uh, advertisement on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it should go, it should go pretty
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should, I could pull up the numbers on
it, but yeah, she'd go, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: Jackson's an outstanding guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just, we're happy to work with him.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you want to maybe let a little cat
out of the bag and tell us maybe some new
[SPEAKER_05]: breeders you're considering adding to the
roster?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've already talked to them all,
so it's, it's not, it's no secret on their
[SPEAKER_00]: behalf, but of course, until, until we
have anything solid, it's all,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all just fictitious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my, my making shit up in case
anything goes south, but, um, we're happy
[SPEAKER_00]: to add Amuerta is coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's a really nice guy out of Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, super, super nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, has some really nice plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I met up with, uh, cannabis,
I believe you, you had, did you interview
[SPEAKER_00]: him?
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, yeah, we're, we're looking to get him
on the show in the near future.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people have had really good
things to say about him, especially Leo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so cornbread Ricky from swamp boys,
uh, I did, I did a post about a month ago
[SPEAKER_00]: asking for, you know, maybe, uh,
there's banks I was sleeping on or people
[SPEAKER_00]: they had and wanted to add.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cornbread Ricky, uh, posted up,
uh, when cannabis, a lot of people want,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis probably got the most tags out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then cornbread Ricky underneath it
posted up saying, you know, grab this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was, that was enough for me to
go, you know, okay, who's this dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I called him up, talked to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in Spain, but awesome guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has some serious fucking history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, knows a lot about, uh, sacred Seabank,
about Neville, about the grateful heads,
[SPEAKER_00]: about, uh, uh, oh, what's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, 2007, uh, res res, res.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says as, as, as the stories,
you have some great stories with about
[SPEAKER_00]: connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, uh, we're excited to get
true on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, the guys, the guys
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'd be great for your show.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's, he's got a lot of history,
doesn't he?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause he, he messaged me just having a
chat about res one day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you kind of reference, I was very
surprised by how, I think he even
[SPEAKER_05]: mentioned he used to work with res.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, I mean, how's that for inside
knowledge?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's, uh, we're used to work with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knows him very, very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to work for connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used to be connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy, you know, I'll let him tell the
stories, but you know, yeah, he's,
[SPEAKER_00]: he got, he got busted once for,
uh, exporting marijuana because he was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to a high times cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he just thinks that he thinks the
people that he asked how to smuggle it out
[SPEAKER_00]: with ratted on him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his entry got flagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he did, he did jail time for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, damn.
Wow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, but cool, very cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to get him on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's something cool to look
forward to.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we should maybe do something a
little controversial.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the opposite end of the new breeders
you're considering, who's a breeder who
[SPEAKER_05]: you think has fallen off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hell kind of questions that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can choose to deny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, all the banks, I no longer carry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just cause I can't, I can't take
shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire brothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grim, you know, um, that's a hot one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nice enough and did, did us all a
favor and said, you know, I will have new
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the old packaging is stuff that,
uh, uh, is older stock and all the new
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging is the newer stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, thanks Rick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the older shit Tommy made and all
the newer shit you made.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been interesting to see the,
uh, the slowdown in the number of
[SPEAKER_05]: offerings from brothers Grimm since Duke's
departure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Duke was the heart and soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shots fired again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heart and soul of that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Duke's just a fucking yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Duke's an animal dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that guy's just, uh, I'm really
glad to call it that I can call him a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend and, uh, he's, he's mentioned
before if there's ever an earthquake out
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to get in his truck and come
out here and save us all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that he'd fucking try.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's just, he's a, he's a, he's a good
dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just him and that massive Swiss army knife
just comes and saves everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, I can't tell stories,
but, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, don't ever play paintball with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't ever play paintball with a fucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause yeah, he will, he will clear the
field of like 10 people to get the guys
[SPEAKER_00]: out of standing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, you know, just continuing on
from that topic, how we were just kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: discussing brothers Grimm.
[SPEAKER_05]: How, how do you think a breeder can
continue to stay relevant in what is
[SPEAKER_05]: essentially an ever-changing market?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe on this one, the swamp boys
get undervalued in or get, get,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, what I say number one or, or do it a
lot, but they just like, they just do what
[SPEAKER_00]: the fuck they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they don't care what anybody else is
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to do what anybody else is
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like leave them alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay away from my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they just do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just do their own fucking thing and
they just care about their own shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: the lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this year I've seen that lemon
Royale man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing really killed it for me last
year in Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and just about every other,
every other time I've seen it or had the
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to, uh, to be around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's something phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's massive and stinky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I really liked those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are back in Florida now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, um, I think they, you know,
they, they said it best sooner for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay current.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to, you have to do what you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like don't try to copy people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause by the time you, time you get to
where they're at, it's gone and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: already the next thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually noticed that about them.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're, they're very much, you know,
like the, uh, the silent grind is just
[SPEAKER_05]: every so often you see a new release and
the genetics are always like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: make your pupils dilate, like,
Whoa, like, and, uh, yeah, sometimes they
[SPEAKER_05]: don't get enough credit, but thankfully
they do have a, you know, a really,
[SPEAKER_05]: really passionate fan base behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause what's interesting is when you
mentioned the lemon Royale, the first
[SPEAKER_05]: thing that jumped to mind was I had seen,
um, our buddy at TK origins posting about
[SPEAKER_05]: who he was growing it out and he was very
impressed by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: TK origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I guess I could get some knowledge
here from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we decided that's the guy who did the
cushions because I in my Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: swipings, I had seen somebody cast,
uh, on a, on a Josh D O G pick what,
[SPEAKER_00]: who did the real thing and Josh did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first of all, I'd seen Josh post no at
TK origins did or something like that to
[SPEAKER_00]: that effect to which surprised me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've never seen that from Josh
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so have they come back to the decide
that's, that's the guy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like from what, from what I can gather,
the, the central people in the story seem
[SPEAKER_05]: to be reasonably happy that it's probably
the case.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone has expressed a small amount of
like, well, you know, it's hard to say a
[SPEAKER_05]: hundred percent for sure type thing,
but on the whole, it seems as though like
[SPEAKER_05]: the main players are able to trace the
connections back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And from what I've been told, he grew the
weed and you know, the seeds were formed
[SPEAKER_05]: in his room, but he wasn't really aware of
them as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just the pounds went out, got sold,
people found the seeds and he was really
[SPEAKER_05]: none the wiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you have this on a show that could
go back and listen to it on, or is this
[SPEAKER_00]: just from your basic knowledge?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think, uh, we briefly touched on it
in the Matt ride episode, and I'm hoping
[SPEAKER_05]: to have cornbread on next episode.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, so I'm hoping to be able to iron
it out, but I did talk to Josh in real
[SPEAKER_05]: life at the Emerald cup and he just
basically said everything I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, is this guy, is that the dreadlock
guy or no, no relations?
[SPEAKER_05]: See, that's what I'm trying to figure out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think the TK origins guy is the
dreadlock guy, but he is like a super
[SPEAKER_05]: surfy dude from Florida.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I feel like maybe they, someone got
sold the bud from the dreadlock guy,
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and on that, uh, one of the guys we've
added in the last two years is Katsu
[SPEAKER_00]: Bluebird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, tell me more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Katsu Bluebird is known for,
uh, his, um, proliferation of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the, of the Katsu Bubba cut,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which, um, so he, he bought it as,
as, as you get him on the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: he can tell stories better than I do,
but he bought it in 2001 where he said he
[SPEAKER_00]: had more dollars than he had since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he bought it off the, off the forms
from some guy, green crack man or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he paid a couple hundred bucks
for it and he got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a half, half a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he got a real healthy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like the day later, the guy
called him and said, Hey, oh, by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, you can't, uh, give it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Katsu was like, that's kind of fucked
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't tell me that part of it when I
spent the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he just started, he was like,
made his duty just to send that Bubba cut
[SPEAKER_00]: out to anybody and everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you hit him up on the forms,
he'd send you that fucking cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're some guy in like Nebraska,
who's growing like your fucking ditch weed
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, cause that's what you had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can meet the guy and you're
looking for information on the forms and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're surfing, you come across this Katsu
guy and his handle and he's, he agrees to
[SPEAKER_00]: send you this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only restriction is that you have
to give it to five other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're now the fucking king of
Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you've got the best fucking
chronic in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've even if you're a city grower,
you start with good genetics, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a good output.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're now growing the best thing
in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's calling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making money all because this guy
you met on the forums has just sent you
[SPEAKER_00]: this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since then, um, all these people that
he sent cuts to have returned the favor
[SPEAKER_00]: and sent cuts back to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he has.
[SPEAKER_00]: This reverse genetic library that's quite
extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, East coast, Saradiso, the Chaco's that
came from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's, uh, you can tell the story on
the bubbles, but, uh, it was the same cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that the old pre 98 story
was that's the only one that Oregon kid
[SPEAKER_00]: knew that he could, that for sure was
before 98 that he had the longest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the other ones were most likely,
but the, that, that, that one cut was the
[SPEAKER_00]: most likely the one he's had since 98 knew
he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's longer than 98.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's what, that's what cats who
got, it was fun to, when I got a catch on
[SPEAKER_00]: the phone, I said, I said, can I get bubba
on the phone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, let's talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's three way the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, yeah, he's like, that'd be
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got bubba on the phone and that was,
you know, the shit coffee book,
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee book tables are made out of,
but they were just talking to each other
[SPEAKER_00]: on how, you know, how cats you really
liked the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was explaining it to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wondered what the cross that it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, bubble came out,
you know, it was like, oh, before,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, before he bubbly even said,
uh, uh, cats, he would guess he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, yeah, it was Northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that guy's a head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got like bandaid haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a bunch of old, uh, a bunch of,
uh, a bunch of really old, great cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to start releasing and that's
once, um, his, his scrum that he just
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed with the bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's got a bubba sister across with a
bubble cross with Kim sis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, a lot of really good stuff
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came to me from that riot as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess Matt, Matt coming out with a good
pig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt, you know, I definitely respect what
Matt has to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, when you interviewed him,
I thought he had a great interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called him up and I was like,
dude, great fucking show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You came across like an asshole,
but a guy that I like and the guy that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we work with, but, um,
you know, sometimes your point of views
[SPEAKER_00]: are a little fucking Dickish and how you
say him, but, but he's a, he's a,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's a purveyor of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and he wants the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I think one of the best things he
said was, you know, people tell lies
[SPEAKER_00]: plants don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's some wise words.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, Oh snap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having just discussed the Katsu Bluebird
and how they're now part of the catalog.
[SPEAKER_05]: It begs the question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you ever considered having cookie fam
on the CETNR catalog?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just kidding, but seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had the opportunity to have cookie
fam last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned them, I turned them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I dodged, I dodged three bullets
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cookie fam was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that offer might have came
through, uh, BZ or those guys that BZ
[SPEAKER_00]: could have come up with them, but they had
a really weird setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, you know, they, they wanted to,
they had a really weird setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to charge 400 and sell it for
500 and let everybody to steal them off
[SPEAKER_00]: you and auction them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like a 30 something pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my deal was that I couldn't,
you know, just tell me you didn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know you didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just tell me who's doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you did it, I don't want it,
but tell me who's doing the, don't stop
[SPEAKER_00]: the candy rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause people are crying and they're crying
and they upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I dodged that bullet,
but no, I can't, uh, uh, and so,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I'll leave my words, but,
um, cookie fam, as I know it, has gone out
[SPEAKER_00]: and done good things as, as far as I know,
uh, maybe public, maybe not, but Jay BZ is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start breeding for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there, uh, it'll be a collab
as far as sharing of the company goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay BZ gets, you know, uh, he gets to
bring his collection out and start working
[SPEAKER_00]: on projects for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they get to push their media and use
their, you know, their social plugins,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will, to push the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I think BZ is a fucking excellent
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think that guy is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he went through, he went through and
took care of all the candy rain bullshit
[SPEAKER_00]: just because he didn't want people to get,
feel like they got ripped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he paid his assistant to like go
through their DMS and get everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking names and numbers and mailed
everybody like the placement backs of his
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, uh, so they weren't upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I guess all came down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess Jigga, he was not found.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: That that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I hadn't heard that part about,
uh, Jay BZ making it right by people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, that's quite nice to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I asked BZ, I said, I said,
just at least stick a sticker in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, Hey, you know, just if you weren't
happy with those, my name is B,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm BZ.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, no, man, I just, I just put
the seeds in the pack and just got them
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, damn, I wouldn't at least
fucking advertise myself on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's like, that wasn't the
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make it right with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So BZ is a really, uh, really,
really see, I say they're really good
[SPEAKER_00]: guys, but they are to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're nice guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talk to them, of course they're
going to be nice because I fucking pay
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I get that part, but BZ is a
really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's, he's, he's a family dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I call him, he's, he's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met his dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we haven't played ping pong yet,
but we're going to, I'm going to take that
[SPEAKER_00]: old man out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, he's a, he's a really cool guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so there was, you know,
there was, yeah, there's this drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, everybody's, everybody's got their
egos into shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem is drama with
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to stay, it's hard to stay
fucking Sweden, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so, it's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You phrase it like that because what I've
noticed is that everyone I know who has
[SPEAKER_05]: interacted with JBZ says he's lovely.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yet he does seem to get quite a bit of
hype.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only reason I can kind of
attribute it to is because he is quite
[SPEAKER_05]: quiet.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like he doesn't, he doesn't like project a
lot of stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: He just kind of does his thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think because there isn't exactly
this huge vocal presence around him,
[SPEAKER_05]: people are just happy to hate on him in a
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be, but he's, you know,
he's going to be, um, of the guys I know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think busy would be like the
most gangstress motherfucker that would
[SPEAKER_00]: stab me in a parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so he's not, he's not going to go
out there and toot his own fucking horn
[SPEAKER_00]: and be like, Hey, look at me, dot,
dot, dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, like he can post pictures all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you fucking need to talk some shit,
he might just block it because he doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: give a fuck, but he's just kind of like a
gangster.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't, you know, you don't,
you never met a gangster that told you
[SPEAKER_00]: they were a gangster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's just quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't need to, you know, say,
look at me, do my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he let his work speak for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he got started going his,
uh, he was picking up packs from,
[SPEAKER_00]: from his, from his guys there in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were, they were charging him more
than taking a percentage of all of his
[SPEAKER_00]: packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, that's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't sell him any cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he got pissed off and flew to
Amsterdam, came back with some beans,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, started growing his own stuff,
breed his own stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started, he reversed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started charging his homeboys,
started taking a tax on their shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: started selling it to them, wouldn't sell
them cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, that's how he came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's been in the, he's been breeding
for a minute since let's say 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he's been in it longer than I'd get
him credit for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the catalog, you know, he's a,
he's a super East LA gas type dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got the gassy nastiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but people are into the, the Cushmans
and stuff right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got his wedding cake at four is
coming on the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what's interesting about his work
is I've always noticed that he was working
[SPEAKER_05]: on that high octane cube in the background
and no one ever really seemed to pay too
[SPEAKER_05]: much attention to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now that he's got it all solid,
and I think it's at the BX three or maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: even further.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's now using that male in other
strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's really, like you said,
adding that gassiness to now the Cushman's
[SPEAKER_05]: and the various other crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and, and it goes, and it goes back to
be, like I said, he's keep your secret
[SPEAKER_00]: secret or a circle small, you know,
uh, he's, he's not that guy that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, caught in, uh, get caught in any drama
or to talk that bad about anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's, like I said, he's not the guy
that talked bad or talk, do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's, he's about it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but he's got, you know,
working haven't the, the numbers that some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these guys are now able to run,
you know, if you, if, if these guys were
[SPEAKER_00]: talented, if they were, you know,
say they were if they were smaller,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were using, you know, back in the day
when they started, they were using a tent
[SPEAKER_00]: or they had a garage or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the ability for them to run the Fino
hunts of the thousands is fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just, just that, that shared ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to be able to go and select
through them, seeing the true structure of
[SPEAKER_00]: the planet, like to be able to go walk
through a room, like walk through exotics
[SPEAKER_00]: room and like see when he's running,
because he, he pops everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, to run through the Finos and see
it all, you know, being of the same or
[SPEAKER_00]: alike is, is, is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but back in the day, you know,
these guys with limited numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't have that ability to run so
many strains and kill so many strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like it just didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, and that's really up in the flood
gates, hasn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's made the guys that are
really good, even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, if they were good,
like I said, that's where I was getting
[SPEAKER_00]: your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were good with one tent,
fuck, give them a whole room and now look
[SPEAKER_00]: at what they look, what they can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and it goes back to, you know,
Mike having that eye, like we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, you know, all the guys that work
with exotic, you know, you can pick a
[SPEAKER_00]: bitch out of a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or a cock out of a sausage party,
but, uh, but, uh, that, that, that ability
[SPEAKER_00]: is just, uh, to notice those traits,
I think is, uh, it was really quite
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, on the, on the large
scale, it makes it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they can, I mean, they can test
their gear more like exotic say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he pops, I think two packs or
three packs of each of his gear,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, to run it before he sells it and make
sure it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to be able to walk through those
rooms and see them and to know that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all solid is, is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, you just didn't have that
ability.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, while we're on the topic of
cookies peripherally, let's quickly wrap
[SPEAKER_05]: this one up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I love always asking this.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think will be the new cookie
cross?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, I mean, what's going to be
the new big hype strain poster child
[SPEAKER_05]: thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gelato is this year's thing, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's what everybody's crossing
everything with now is gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know things, uh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say you talking about runs
in your life up.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it never runs runs in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard this runs thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like the shittest meme ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just about how like runs is like a
gelato cross or gelato S1.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just like all the fuck boys are
on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They, they love it, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want that runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of, that's, that's the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fucking cross to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a gelato, then it's going to
sell out and be the, the shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, whether or not they fucking grow it or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know, but, you know,
it's, it's, it's also, it all depends on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know Duke, you know, he's giving me
some shit that whenever that guy wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: release it, he's going to own it,
but he doesn't, you know, he's sitting on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, doesn't want to release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, like some of the stuff he's got
is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, his, his, uh, schmuckers is quite
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_05]: When are we going to see more schmuckers,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause sometimes you, you do see it pop its
head up here and there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just think maybe the problem is
people don't know what they're missing out
[SPEAKER_05]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whenever people want it to be out in
the market, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I know, like I said, Duke's got it to
me a couple of times and he's got
[SPEAKER_00]: something else called Sally's Beauty
Salon, which is he tries to just make me
[SPEAKER_00]: guess the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll just fucking send me straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, he's definitely sitting on some
shit, but I think, you know, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are, they're sitting on stuff
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like not everybody believes that
this is a cool and fair market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not, not everybody's coming off
their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to say, I know that people have stuff
that I've tested and tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Oh, when's that going to see
the light of day?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, it's not, I'm not giving
this shit out, but you know, I still,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the thing that was, that's,
that sits in my nose the most is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: from Indo Expo this year, Denver,
uh, Denver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, right at the end of the show,
this guy came up and he had the fucking,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like he was too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was two people away from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as he popped the jar,
it was fucking maple syrup, like all day
[SPEAKER_00]: long, like pancakes and fucking maple
syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: No question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, and so my Brooks was there,
Jason Brooks, whoopsie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Jason, but pop the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, dude, pancakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was maple syrup all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that guy has a really,
really nice thing of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that ever sees, you know,
you can, I was like, dude, you can make an
[SPEAKER_00]: entire line around this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, do you know what strainer was?
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just something he made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to get a hold of him,
but it wasn't even something he made.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was popping beans for a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but it was just, it was so uniquely
fucking shit, dead on maple syrup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, you know, I was like,
okay, don't lose that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, you've just spurred a
thought in my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been seeing our friend Obsolete post
a lot about this pretzels thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you give us the inside scoop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yes, I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, hashtag pretzel fam.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all covered in the Indian shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I will say that, um, I just had some
new hats printed up with his logos on
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got that done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to see him come back out in the
game and, uh, get back on the,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the DMs or get, get back on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, hopefully he's not answering his
fucking DM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, don't give him, but that's what I
see a lot of my breeders, a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders, like the, they're there for
their public, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes the public can drive them
fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I know Duke told me that he was,
he spends, you know, Duke will answer
[SPEAKER_00]: every fucking DM he gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes he says it takes three hours
and sometimes people just ask the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, you know, maybe just a food
for thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're talking to breeders and then he
gets short tempered with you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: read, maybe sometimes, but I know that's
what, that's what drove obsolete into
[SPEAKER_00]: being obsolete was two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was just like, it came to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck Facebook, fuck Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done spending six hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: My DM and DMS and it just got off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and unfortunately his sales declined.
[SPEAKER_00]: He became, you know, uh, obsolete if you
will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, which was, which was, which was
weird to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was weird for him to be like the,
the tester, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, he was, he was guaranteed from
solid gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just being stagnant because there
wasn't anything, it wasn't anything
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't see pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't out there in the current runs
and people were using this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to believe that part of the Mac is
there's an obsolete in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe his orange Congolese or his orange
cookies.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, it's not the first time we've heard
that sentiment and it's, it's even more
[SPEAKER_05]: fitting that you bring up the orange
cookies because I have noticed,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm sure many others have that our
buddies over at Jungle Boys are going to
[SPEAKER_05]: start to be breeding soon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something you've been keeping an
eye on?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not, that's not, see, uh,
I don't know, buyer beware.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you want me to explain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I, you sell weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you sell weed,
now all of a sudden you're a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What to look for and you know how to
breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know about recessive shit in your
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, I like people to stay in their own
lanes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, uh, like I've always
told my guys, have they ever seen me
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking making seeds or become a breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your shit and run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I should, I think that just adds
seedy to a seedy business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and some of these guys that are
starting to breed that used to run seed
[SPEAKER_00]: banks, I think is fucking, I'm like,
I can't make this shit up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was driving traffic to me because I
think it's, it's just shady when people
[SPEAKER_00]: make their own, you know, their seed bank
and they make seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, for them to be, so that's facts
are facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got famous off through other people's
weed, kind of right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was weed through obsolete weed through
other people's shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they should just keep getting
famous off other people's weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, try to take all the credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's enough food on the table for
everybody to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't we all just drive the same
fucking cars that we used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's kind of like, it's kind of
like, you know, cookie fam, like all the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that bought into the candy rain
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, but if you didn't know that they
didn't make the cookies, then you haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can claim it, but they didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you did it, you can do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or more so you have a mail and that's not,
and that's not to say that, that fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: love childs are bad because you know,
six of the top 10 or love childs have
[SPEAKER_00]: never meant to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were accidents that happened,
but for you to claim it more, start a
[SPEAKER_00]: company behind that rep when it was just
mother nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking taking care of the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, is, is something you shouldn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you shouldn't, you should leave that
up to breeders who go for things for a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I always say, you know,
what proves it in my eyes, or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: from my bank is that, um, when people
claim strains is if you did it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the pieces to make it,
or you have the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't, then it was luck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can, I can get down with that
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our, so our, so that's like of the 45
or 50 banks that I now represent on the,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the site there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not one of them uses the same mail,
all different males.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that used to be a common thing in
the Amsterdam days, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like they'd share miles between each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, and that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all share bitches.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all share clones around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, Sally is a nice sound and
as harsh as it may be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all pass girls around, but nobody shows
dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so nobody wants to hold onto your mail
for you in case it might go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fuck up his room just because you want
to have your backup mail somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you always hear people losing
their males.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, that's, that's the only way
for me to separate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause nobody passes around.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not people passing around males.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's people that pass around there,
you know, pass around clone only or female
[SPEAKER_00]: plants or they're using female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the males that are unique to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, if you take, we've been using
exotic a lot just because he's got,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he just, he just cleaned up at
one of the last cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got four cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are six cups and four of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't even go for, but, um,
if you come to me and you use one of his
[SPEAKER_00]: males, like I'm not going to want to
represent that because that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: taking, you know, a selection of his
library of fruit off his plate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so I wouldn't want to represent
that, that, that, that stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you came to me and you took like
exotics mail and crossed it with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with Crockett's Tangy and he came up
with, you know, exotic Tangy, then that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause now you've done homework and you've,
you've done some work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you found a male that was uniquely
yours and now you want to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I can support and I will rep,
but, uh, stuff that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't do or use another people's
stock, basically his stuff and his stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to breed and make something right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not, we're not, uh, not
representing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not to say that those people
that are doing that are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like if you start with good and
cross it with good, you're going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out with pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, me and, me and X were talking to
one of the shows and, um, about how,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, people will come up to his booth
and they have better phenos or a found
[SPEAKER_00]: better phenos than what he currently has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we discussed, I was like,
that's, that's part of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you, or your breeding to enhance
the strain, to make it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't want people to come up to
you that are, you know, saying that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get your shit or make it,
you know, that your, your strains the best
[SPEAKER_00]: or that your phenos the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that means you're just fucking
putting the strain out the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, if you're making the strain
better, you're strengthening it,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're sending out better genetics
than what you started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you want people to come
back with is shit that you have that's
[SPEAKER_00]: better than what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a testament to,
you know, breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: When people come up to their booth and
bring them shit that they grew is better
[SPEAKER_00]: than they started with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me to exceed the parents, a bit of a
common idea we hear, but I would love to
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly ask just to wrap up our last point
about the cookies in the jungle boys
[SPEAKER_05]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you, do you have a little guilty
pleasure strain that comes from one of
[SPEAKER_05]: those crews?
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a feeling everyone does.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, jungle boys didn't really,
they haven't done anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they grow good flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice, but the genetics still belong
to the individual breeders that they used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know that they put out
anything that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies who doesn't, you know,
who hasn't liked cookies when it first
[SPEAKER_00]: came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made, I made us ton of money selling
fucking cookie clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I even had cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have the real cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got fuckied.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fortune, the fortune cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fake cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, that's how I started a bunch of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, everybody likes that,
but that's worn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always, I can't say that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always just, I've always just been a
hater on them because I couldn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get past the part that,
you know, I think that St. George did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that dog don't hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when, when's he going to pop his head
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's one of those, like we were
talking about earlier, there's stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, people are, I think they're
sitting on, cause they're still,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they don't, they don't believe
in the legal market or believe that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they want to see what plays out
and how people, you know, let's say that
[SPEAKER_00]: Filo's does get away with what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or let's say that Filo's comes out next
week and has this crazy breeding project
[SPEAKER_00]: where they are able to, you know,
a plant replicator gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now they're fucking, they're putting
out your shit that you had just because
[SPEAKER_00]: other people submitted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it never got submitted in the first
place, then they would never know about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would never be able to fucking put
the plant ray gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's people out there that are
sitting on things that never want them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant ray gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way they're never able to have pieces
to remake it or put it back together
[SPEAKER_00]: again, if you will.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the next thing I wanted to chat about
is kind of something I've been thinking
[SPEAKER_05]: about myself.
[SPEAKER_05]: When will seeds here now be shipping to
Australia and or other banned countries,
[SPEAKER_05]: if at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you gotta go there, dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not banned country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may have attempted your wonderful
country and they may have stopped it in
[SPEAKER_00]: customs a couple of times and sent it
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure where we were with our last
game that we played.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to talk and see off the air
over that where that went with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can get us into a different,
whole other path of of talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really fucking frustrating right
now with that, with the fact that the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: bill passed in 12 of 18, which came out
and said that, you know, anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: any any material, any matter, anything,
anything with less than 0.3 percent GHC is
[SPEAKER_00]: is hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything above is cannabis GHC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so banking should be fucking legal to
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that fact that it's so there's nothing
illegal with shipping seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was to smash up a hundred or smash up
a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's say they were to, you know,
as far as shipping goes, there's it won't
[SPEAKER_00]: come back and test, I believe,
at the THC mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are still, you know, un-germinated
items.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know why when the
governments are all going to snap up to it
[SPEAKER_00]: or get through with it and decide that
this is a radical plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And furthermore, I can't just get on my
soapbox here and build it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come back down off here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But furthermore, I think that the fucking
citizens of the United States should be
[SPEAKER_00]: pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I want to start seeing some like,
aren't we upset that the government that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just now allowing this shit to be
legalized and we're fucking thankful for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to legalize again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you guys have known this shit since
37.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have done this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fucking you may have had the cure for
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have had the cure for autism or at
least made life more pleasurable or
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyable for those with those ailments
through the use of this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you fucking banned it in 37 and fuck
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know why, you know,
I wish the people of the states would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we pushed that on everybody else's
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we were the ones that drove the war
hammer the hardest, as far as it will,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as the other nations that it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And banned what is now coming to fruition
to be a very helpful plant that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: us, you know, grew up with, got shunned
for, or, you know, got familyed or
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatized or fucked over with because we
were, you know, smoking or self-medicating
[SPEAKER_00]: with our alternative medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, no, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this is the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your little chemical pill shit is the
alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this is the original medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that, you know,
people of the states here, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting pissed off that they're just
now allowing us to use this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've seen too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start to see them spinning it as far as
CBD is now coming from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not like, oh, this is weed,
patent marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this CBD comes from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, bitch, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's not, you don't, nobody went
back and fucking told Mother Nature that
[SPEAKER_00]: we decided 37, one was hemp and one was
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one was cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we didn't tell Mother Nature the
fucking terms of our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes back as cannabis sativa L,
if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, but I started to see the
media like trying to cover their fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: asses by saying that this is, you know,
from a drive from hemp plants and only
[SPEAKER_00]: from hemp plants, you know, or,
and not giving, not giving the full plant
[SPEAKER_00]: the full attention it's due.
So.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, I, I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I often wonder, for example,
if people will look back in the future and
[SPEAKER_05]: think this was like a almost a hundred
year version of like alcohol prohibition,
[SPEAKER_05]: where like looking back, they're like,
what, like, why did they ban it?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's such a stupid move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, no, I think for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we're so, you know,
America, the only country that fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: banned the cure for cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and I definitely think we'll
look back, especially when, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're still just at the, at the forefront
of this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about medical, medical
ailments and different, the ability to use
[SPEAKER_00]: isolates, distillates, and then separate
things and put things together and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, dial in exact combos for people,
which I think we'll all fortunately and
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately be part of the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the future, like I've seen it
happen to in some of these places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I feel very good about it,
but they'll, they'll have pens that are
[SPEAKER_00]: just like, relax, calm, sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've all seen those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't, I mean, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting them all together,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want fucking, I want alien orange
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, give me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want Shirls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, onto a bit of a different
topic, but one I did wanted to bring up
[SPEAKER_05]: with you again.
[SPEAKER_05]: We spoke, which we did speak about in our
first conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think you might ever get around to,
I know there's a lot of other things going
[SPEAKER_05]: on, but do you think you ever might get
around to working on that breeder catalog
[SPEAKER_05]: or is logistically it's just a bit hard?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at some print on demand
services the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was, I went back and listened to
our last show, but yeah, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I would like to, because I can at
least do it with, with the brands that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have that are solid and have the,
you know, the basic, the building blocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I think a lot of the,
the breeder's have been doing is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they get the, the basic building
blocks, the strains that they're notorious
[SPEAKER_00]: for, and then they kind of build off
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we could definitely do it probably
as a catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, maybe I always want to do like a
calendar, like a one year calendar with
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains of the month as of the
pictures.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just all cookies, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All cookies, cookie fam and jungle boys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just, just doing like a slab squat on like
10 of the 12 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
[SPEAKER_05]: The last two months we'll get our Mendo
Dope in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it by, try it by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've heard, I'm sure you've,
oh, so that's another ad addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we also have added Miss Jill since last
time we talked.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the same, the same reason that I
wouldn't take other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, when she came to me,
I was like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she came to me in an odd fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say that like Odie and Sonny
Chiba were first like, Hey, you should add
[SPEAKER_00]: Jill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, from you two, like you
guys would be the first ones to fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: hate her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I've heard very many
things come out of your mouth about her,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as they tell it, she's a much
different person.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's different than she was when she was
with Sepco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I said, I told her, I said,
well, that still doesn't change the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that you probably learned everything from
Sepco and I don't, you know, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: that I want that kind of breeding
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to support that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and she let me know that,
you know, one of the things about her
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, her releases is that they're not
being bred by her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a, she's in a collab with a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget his name off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's Moza.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's taking, so it's not her that's
doing the breeding and she's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: quick to say that, but it's her strains
and it's her, you know, picking them and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot, working through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's, so that's why I
said, okay, you know, that, that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: represent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't want to play off that,
you know, you're this breeder now because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are, I don't want to represent
it because you'd suck at it because you
[SPEAKER_00]: learn from, from suck, suck, learn,
suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, no, uh, but she said, you know,
she's working with another guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that I think is that I can work with
her and she's got a whole Jilly line.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's coming up with Jilly, Jilly beans
and what not oranges and flavors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad things worked out for her.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, and I know people are quick
to hate on sub, but I, I think it's kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of sad to see what's happened to him.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like I think subs in a bit of a
bad place at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that we put ourselves in
certain positions by our certain actions
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I hear some, some is different
from what I'm told now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've never been a fan of the guy,
uh, who will put back on the exotic again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if some, but it watched the way he
talked to people, fucking exotic would
[SPEAKER_00]: have been breeding for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's who exotic, you know,
those are the videos that that guy that he
[SPEAKER_00]: watched.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for as much as I dislike some cool
for, you know, I, I, I get what he's
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, but he tries to take, he tries to
do what I don't want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like take credit for their strains or for
them being in positions to win things or
[SPEAKER_00]: to get notoriety because she was the
broker for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants credit for, for doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I get it from being from a broker
side where we're distribution and we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, we push certain strains and we can,
you know, we can do these and do those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the credit still lies in the
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't, I don't have nothing to do
with it besides, you know, get it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: customer or making a suggestion to the
customer, relaying the information you
[SPEAKER_00]: give me to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, and that's where me and somebody,
you know, differ on thoughts and opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: is he wants, he wants credit for
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I think that, that it is,
it's not a hard pill to swallow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think our credit comes from when I
get paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's my, I'm, I'm a broker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I move, I move gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I don't have, uh, I don't have
feminized strains, whether I like them or
[SPEAKER_00]: not, my customers want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I need them, I'll find them and
I'll find breeders are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have them and again, good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I, if I want autos, I'm not a fan
autos, but if you need autos because of
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're at, you're fucking in
Washington until they're going to get an
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor crop that are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, excuse me, you're in Alaska and
that's the only way to get an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who am I to say that, that,
you know, I don't want you to go to my
[SPEAKER_00]: competition and buying shitty seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see, let me sign and find some good
ones and see who we can go with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I, I, I called it two years ago,
as far as my Festo goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys fucking continue to hit it out
of the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had some situations as of late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to Mitch recently,
but, uh, their gear is still, it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: top of my charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you found any other auto,
auto FIM guys that are working lines like
[SPEAKER_00]: they did or they do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I don't want to sell anyone short,
but not they're in a league of their own
[SPEAKER_05]: Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just wish they could scale,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They put in the work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of, they do lots of works on those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just take a plant and flip it
over overnight and make it an auto FIM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's some breeding and some,
some shit that's got to go on with
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding of photos and non-photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and your breeding habits, like four
times, three times each way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they, when they realized how much
work they do as opposed to other people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't do, they were a little perturbed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's been a minute since we last spoke
and we haven't, I haven't really touched
[SPEAKER_05]: on it much on the show because a lot of
other people such as Sungrown Meds have
[SPEAKER_05]: done a really good job about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, um, the phylos controversy,
you know, like I wanted to ask,
[SPEAKER_05]: how can anyone feel confident about
getting any form of genetic mapping done
[SPEAKER_05]: nowadays?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, do you just have to accept if you
want to get some genetic mapping done,
[SPEAKER_05]: that shit's going to get sold one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what, that's what people
have come, you know, uh, we, we called it
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we, um, we were with them for,
for a minute until they couldn't explain
[SPEAKER_00]: their business model to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Ralph and the guys today,
you know, uh, you don't have this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this facility, these machines,
these technicians for fucking $7 a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's, that's not going to reach
your overhead.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's like, what's the end game?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing with the rest of that
fucking, of that, uh, that sequence?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they, and they didn't have an
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, they came out and told
LeBlanc, Jerry LeBlanc on his show that
[SPEAKER_00]: they would never do breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nishan came out and said that Jerry has
it, has it on tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Nishan said they'd never do
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of, it's just, it's really
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what everybody thought was going on
was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we all thought that that was the
ability or, you know, at least to give
[SPEAKER_00]: them a further heads up and start on a
project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Dunn had them on the day after that or
two days after that story broke,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dunn had them on the show so they could,
uh, damage control, damage control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was fucking worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know if you're listening or
not, but they didn't do themselves any
[SPEAKER_00]: favors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I was a PR guy out there,
I'd be calling philist right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, Hey, you guys need a PR guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they were like, he was just lighting
himself up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Left and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, we never, never, never plan
to be breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but just like, we kind of had to be
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then he just kept saying
like, we'll never sell your information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll never sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just thought like, we'll never will,
but that we never will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the company we sell our ass to fucking
drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they won't sell your information,
but whatever they sell out to,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard, and I don't know if it's
true or not, but I've heard that they've,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they've, they've been offered money or
they've, they've tried to sell,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they only have the short code read.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't do the long code.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they can't tell the difference
between cookies and OKGB.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_05]: How things that are clearly different
sometimes sharp is the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And of, and of course you could argue
there's some close relation, but that does
[SPEAKER_05]: seem like a short sighting in the
technology, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just, and I believe that comes from
reading just the short code on the
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they had pulled the long code,
which is more expensive and more extensive
[SPEAKER_00]: process when they were doing these tests,
then they would have had valuable data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say, cause that's what it all comes
down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they don't have that or the data
they have is incomplete.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't tell the difference right
now between, you know, on the Filos chart,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as, you know, cookies and OKGB,
because they're so the short code shows
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you know, same, same, same,
but the long code would read them
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, I don't know what truth,
like I said, there is to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, everything I say, no,
it's true on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a fucking liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I just, it's all hearsay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is all just for entertainment
purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always, always.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the next thing I wanted to bring up,
much more lighthearted point than the past
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit of discussion, but what is with
breeders and their obsession with breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: pit bulls?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got you, Elena, Bob Hemphill,
and JJ.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's a trend here.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And JJ's pit bulls, this, and I'm not a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just recently got a mail that Elena
has bred from green fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's just a little awesome stud boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's very set for a couple of shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so nonetheless, Elena is still a
breeder of dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: JJ still with with with pits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microtech also does dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's just breeders and
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hate to bring up his ironic again,
because he's kind of like fucking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, just fucking be his biggest
fanboy this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I talked to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's my guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's breeding chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so he's got he's got fucking wants
black chickens that lay green eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for if we think about exotic and the
extent he goes to in his cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to what extent is he going to
in his chicken breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that means he's fucking sourcing
eggs from Canada, bringing them through
[SPEAKER_00]: customs, hatching them, incubating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so he has different fucking ones
because they're the because chickens like
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking cannabis are all going to be
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he hatches them from fucking eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when everyone's don't make the
cut, he sits, he says, he says,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, there's this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, dude, that's the winner
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, no, that one's ended up in
the fucking frying pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he made like the fucking W of chicken
huts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look on his Instagram, it's like
these chicken huts are all fucking piped
[SPEAKER_00]: and plumbed and all fucking marbled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, God damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was it was a tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went off on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's just breeders breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we look at Archive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was started with orchids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my guy, I'm Werta, who I'm bringing on,
he fucking does pythons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, very unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big pythons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's fucking smart about it,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the same the same things are
characteristics for color.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can use them in his same cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, I let him explain all that
because it was it blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't like snakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fucking nonetheless big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to fucking squeeze you to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I like I don't even like hugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, yeah, snakes, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he used to breed snakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's in the can.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's doing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: What a crossover.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you brought up a good little talking
point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Micotech just released that GG4 IVL.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell me a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my PR, I'm not allowed to mention that
strain by its name.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, because of that lawsuit
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but we just try to avoid the
drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, somebody else put one out now
who, I guess, you know, it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily Josie just approved,
but did his own fucking work and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: smart and got it back to an IVL and has
documentation of the fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Josie, he's even sent Josie a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's cool with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, Micotech put it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They flew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were gone day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to have tech back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy is once again a breeders breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you follow him online, you see he
controls the penis envy, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's all around a good guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's rough that gets us into a
different subject, but in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you got him back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working together again.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a he is a really good breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the whole politics of fucking
seeds is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of which, I need to come and
visit you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to come down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to come down under my my we got a
prawn on the shrimp, in fact, on the
[SPEAKER_00]: barbie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me shrimp on the barbie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a knife.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll lose track of how many times people
call you a cunt in an endearing way.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll come back calling people cunts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Dude, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I come to the States, I have to like
watch myself because people just use it as
[SPEAKER_05]: like a substitute for friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what they call here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like girls don't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most women do not appreciate the C word.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a female friend and we probably call
each other that word every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, yeah, I just kind of know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not a lot of females enjoy that word.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to slap in time, that's when
you bring out that word.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the difference.
[SPEAKER_05]: We traded.
[SPEAKER_05]: We traded guns for the use of the word
cunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cunt, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was an all right trade,
you know, retrospectively.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, let's let's get back into this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we were already back in this
bitch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, we were.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll cut that bit out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, just I mean, going on that last
point, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems like there's a lot of people in
the community who really kind of only see
[SPEAKER_05]: things in black and white, no shades of
gray type thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a businessman, you seem well aware
that you can't allow yourself to fall into
[SPEAKER_05]: this pit for yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can see the proof of that by virtue
of the fact that there are breeders who
[SPEAKER_05]: you yourself admit you didn't once get
along with are now part of the seats in
[SPEAKER_05]: our lineup.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what would your advice be to people out
there who have these long standing grudges
[SPEAKER_05]: and, like, won't go near a certain person
because of, like, something which may even
[SPEAKER_05]: not be related to them, like maybe it
happened to a friend or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just happened ages ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: What would be your advice?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like, do you feel like people
need to take a step back and trust people
[SPEAKER_05]: a bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you fucking I see you wrote that one
sitting on the toilet, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good Lordy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think everybody does in general,
like a lot of people just because our
[SPEAKER_00]: general mentality, I think some of us have
maybe seen this as a as a as a green rush,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, and it looked short term
and been like, hey, you know, let's let's
[SPEAKER_00]: get what I can get while I'm getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're missing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the picture, like, look at the long
term of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an actual industry and a business
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't you can't treat shit like
you used to be able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you, for instance, you had a
situation with somebody in the past and
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't like somebody, you could
relatively meet them at the airport and
[SPEAKER_00]: duke it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one person would win and one
person would get their ass kicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter whose side won, it would be
over and it wouldn't continue to fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: haunt the channels of Facebook or
Instagram or any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two guys would fucking figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, with everybody in everybody's
business, shit just gets gets overblown
[SPEAKER_00]: and quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think before we overblow things,
you know, try to reach out to that person
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think I was, of course,
I think I was on the right side of things
[SPEAKER_00]: because I judge myself well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But recently, somebody posted that they
had a difference with our country.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't like me, they didn't like my
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody else posted another comment
on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went back to the original two people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, hey, I said, before I say anything
online or before I ask you about anything
[SPEAKER_00]: about you two, is there something I did do
you wrong or is something in some way that
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucking wronged you for you to say this
to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know, those screenshots shied
me with it, like, hey, you know about
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I reshotted them in direct messages
instead of just putting them up a blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one guy came back to me and he
said, he said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I didn't post that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, my web guy, I went through the
stuff he doesn't post.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, I can't get into my Instagram
account.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't get into this other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was like, I'm sorry, I didn't post
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, it's not a lot of the shit
adds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of hard to believe
that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're telling me you didn't post
it, everything I know about you is that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a fucking issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then yeah, just give me a favor to say
something that you didn't mean to post it
[SPEAKER_00]: or you just take it down and say you
didn't post it and we're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, even each breeder has their
say 10 fanboys that will fucking take a
[SPEAKER_00]: bullet for him, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, their opinion matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they say something negative about
me or the company, not only does it hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of breeders, but it's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys are gonna take it to heart,
they're fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I asked him, just try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, cool, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took care of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was said and done with,
which I thought was handled the way it
[SPEAKER_00]: should have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you look at that more in
depth, because then what should I seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means if somebody had to hack his
account to say shit about me, to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: look like I was mad at him, and that'll
make them two fucking piss off each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what kind of weird bullshit is that
in this world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a guy who hacks someone
else's account just to talk shit about me,
[SPEAKER_00]: to make me not happy with that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that, in fact, is what allegedly
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have no reason not to believe
this other guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't, you know, I didn't let it
blow out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just reached out to the guy and said,
hey, did you ever take it down and say you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't say it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're cool, and he did it,
and it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have an issue with him to start
with, and I have an issue with him now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's a weird gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're not, like I said,
we're not in the time of day where we
[SPEAKER_00]: could just kick somebody's door in or go
meet them at the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not still at the day where we
could file contracts and fucking sue
[SPEAKER_00]: people yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then, you know, that's still
frowned upon because it's legal
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you sue somebody for violating a
contract?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's either that or kicking their
fucking front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't do that because you guys are
calling me an asshole, and my lawyer says
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never win that case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's a real conundrum of what to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know that kicking anybody's
fucking front door is the right answer to
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if we could sit down and smoke a
bowl with them and figure shit out,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd probably be a lot better world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be too fucking easy, and there
wouldn't be drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need drama to sell shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's stir the pot a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how that got me on to
thinking about this, but one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: coolest moments I had this past year was
being able to go see the Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_00]: with Kim Dogg at Foxboro, the same place
that he saw his first show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went and saw, I've never seen Grateful
Dead before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was never one of the dead ends,
didn't really get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knew they were acid, knew they were
parking lot, knew, of course, the Kim
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mickey Hart, one of the drummers for
Grateful Dead, and I'd say one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: drummers, if you're not familiar with the
Grateful Dead, if you are as a band,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's a little thing about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else says I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two fucking drum kids up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two guys playing the drums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're each, as I put it to Kim Dogg,
and he said I said it correctly,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said, he's like, yeah, that's how you
would think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one drummer will finish, the other
drummer will finish the sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if there were to be speech and the
drums were talking, like one drummer would
[SPEAKER_00]: finish the other guy's sentence,
but the other guy would do other things in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of the other guy's sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was pretty fucking cool to see
both guys going off on all the songs,
[SPEAKER_00]: just playing together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know bands that have one drum kit
or one drummer, so to see a pair of them
[SPEAKER_00]: was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we met up with Mickey Hart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mickey Hart's one of the drummers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like 73.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy's a fucking animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He played something called The Beam,
which was super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked in his RV.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had like 10 or 12 provosts RVs out
there, which are like the half million
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were just starting their tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mickey and Kim Dogg had done a strain
together, or had done a collab,
[SPEAKER_00]: a release together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mickey has a brand of what's called
Mindful Mindset that's managed by his
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful daughter, Rhea, like the Rhea
Sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they got together and the guy who runs
the LA store, Kim Dogg's friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: hooked him up, IC Collective, hooked up
Mickey with the 90, the Kim 91,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they put that in joints that were
three tenths of a gram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got 10, three tenths of a gram joints,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about three tenths of a
gram, it's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a fucking pinner, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this little joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, man, when it comes to this
cute little 10, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this little pinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's like, yeah, I'm looking
about getting the big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, geez.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you got to think in today's
market, you know, some guy that's smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time, which obviously Mickey is
not that fucking guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you a story about that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for somebody who may be smoking the
first time, a tenth of a gram might get
[SPEAKER_00]: him or a three tenths of a gram might get
him high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they were little pin joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to get Mickey on and
interview him just as far as music goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you could ever score that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so he told me he's like, yeah,
like basically the fucking, he gave me his
[SPEAKER_00]: history of weed, which is fucking
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll relay it to you as best as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he says in 64, 65, 66, like they'd
have the bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would, you know, they call them
bricks because they came in these little
[SPEAKER_00]: bricks, you know, they were hard and
square, you know, like bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd throw the money down and they'd throw
the weed up and, you know, we'd smoke it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, lots of seeds and stems,
you know, lots of seeds and stems and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then he's like, and then I remember,
I remember the other stuff coming around
[SPEAKER_00]: in the seventies that had less,
less seeds and stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he was like, I can remember,
like, I think it was 73, maybe first time
[SPEAKER_00]: we experienced the Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys came up and said that,
man, we got some weed that'll really knock
[SPEAKER_00]: you on your ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, oh, we're the fucking dead
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you say, he's like, so we smoke
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like an hour later, he was like,
we're just looking at each other on the
[SPEAKER_00]: couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, hey, you want to play?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, no, you want to play?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, no, we didn't want to get up,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just didn't want to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people are just like, they're
yelling out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get all pissed off at us because we
don't want to fucking move.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, and that's, that was the,
that was the first time we experienced the
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then, and then he went
through how he was growing stuff and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how he was had some cold grows
that were unsuccessful, but he tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just like the history of
cannabis and that band have definitely got
[SPEAKER_00]: a fucking tie together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really cool just to see him and
Kim Dogg kind of talk about the history of
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves together and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Mickey where he's at, Mickey didn't
realize that there was more than one Kim
[SPEAKER_00]: 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, there's, I was like,
you know, you can do different releases in
[SPEAKER_00]: different brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, me, the marketing guy,
I'm like, you know, you can do a chem
[SPEAKER_00]: assist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a fucking, you know,
a chem dean.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, there's different phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's incredible story.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember you posted that up and I was a
bit intrigued as to what actually went
[SPEAKER_05]: down, but cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never, never would I have thought he had
such interesting stories, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess also should be expected.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and definitely fucking bucket
list type of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I couldn't be more humbled that,
that Kim Dogg asked me to go that he's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I, I consider that guy a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He blew me up a wonka pipe that he made
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy's really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those guys a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and him and Kim's wife are some good
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certainly I can attest to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, I've met his wife once
and she was lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for them to ask me and,
and then to have like, not just the
[SPEAKER_00]: experience of it, like four tickets,
but Mickey Hart to his credit,
[SPEAKER_00]: his fucking production manager was the
most fucking on the ball guy shit man
[SPEAKER_00]: ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this guy had fucking 15 iron to the
fire and he's just fired in all
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: As nice as he could fucking be just a
really excellent road guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was in his Mickey's personal
manager, but the guy was fucking on the on
[SPEAKER_00]: the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he, he got us hooked up with a suite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was stocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't, you know, it wasn't,
it was stocked with popcorn, water,
[SPEAKER_00]: drinks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he hooked us up with backstage
tickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got, we got backstage and we're
like, you know, pretty much like the only
[SPEAKER_00]: pair that were back there while Mickey,
I'm not sure if you're familiar with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the show, but I guess they call it
drums in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a break for the, for the,
for the band.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Mickey and the other drummer and
the almond brother come up and they do
[SPEAKER_00]: like this fucking awesome thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, drums and bells and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really, just really cool to see
it from firsthand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm used to, you know, making music
production on the dance music side,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, you know, if you want to fucking
symbol or you want a high hat,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just add a new bar and just cut and
paste a little high hat right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sixties, if you needed a fucking
cowbell every 12 beats, well, you need the
[SPEAKER_00]: guy to fucking hit the cowbell every 12
beats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you couldn't just fucking cut and
paste that guy in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You needed to do it over there and just
be, you know, knocking this other you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, this opposite rhythm that you're
doing and hitting the cowbell weirdly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just to, to witness that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he played, like I said,
this beam thing, which earlier he had
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to us about, man, just,
oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sending sonically, sending images through
your mind to you by the use of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of, of scanning through drones,
sending new drones into your mind and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting you to like, remember a fucking
feeling about a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think it's, it's crazy,
but then I wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, dude, my research on the guy and
Mickey Hunter is like, he's not just a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking grateful dead drummer,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's like this accomplished fucking
world musician.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's got all these fucking scholars
and credits for, you know, world beat
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this, you know, South Africa's shit,
doing this European shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, wow, this guy is seriously into
the sound of percussion and bass and
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking beats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what if that's true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as smart as this fucking guy is like,
what if he can sonically send me shit in
[SPEAKER_00]: my mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like images that make me recall a fucking
flavor, like fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when he was playing it, like I got him
on camera and he's looking at me and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like, dude, you're beaming people on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I asked him, I said,
you're going to play the beat tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to send some drones.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, we'll take it out for a spin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, like so talented in so many
different ways, but just one particular
[SPEAKER_05]: really weird kook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't think it's for a cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, I'd be able to send people
sonic messages through the fucking sound
[SPEAKER_00]: waves and make them recall a strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's basically what it was is that
I can, by scanning a barcode, I can send
[SPEAKER_00]: you sound drones that make you trigger
that thought.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty wild stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's out there, but as accomplished
as he is, you know, you look at all this
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking credit, you're like, well,
maybe he's honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird until it's fucking not,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, maybe we should depart back to the
realm of regular cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it done detour.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was, that was a good little detour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's, um, something I didn't ask you when
I should have, um, how do you feel about
[SPEAKER_05]: last year's Emerald cup?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it was a little different,
wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year Emerald cup was, uh,
there's a few situations that we,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, had to overcome that made the show a
little more difficult than average than
[SPEAKER_00]: usual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we played by the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I thought there's a little early
for California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the sale, but we played by the
book anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, paid out an enormous amount
of taxes, 28.13%, which, uh, made me take
[SPEAKER_00]: a huge loss on shit because I only didn't
do the math right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, we paid a total of all those
28.13% taxes to, uh, all of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the city's taxes and the state taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a chunk of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they just, it didn't, it didn't go as
smoothly last year as we would have liked
[SPEAKER_00]: at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate, um, all the customers that
did wait in line, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: after I heard what had happened on
Saturday, I was a little, it was a little
[SPEAKER_00]: rough and we weren't, we weren't able to
basically that you were almost so mobbed
[SPEAKER_00]: with people and I didn't even come to them
the night before, the day before I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, so what kind of, um, you know,
I'm thinking like, you know, aircraft,
[SPEAKER_00]: aircraft lines, like the zigzag Z's kind
of stack people in, like, what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: planned for crowd control?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, she had, I had found out
earlier that week that we were right next
[SPEAKER_00]: to fucking calculator and Mike and exotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know, we're fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've got 10 banks here in my five
booths and those guys is overflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and sure enough, uh, we were fucked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it was a big shit show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the lines didn't get made properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were getting in line just to get in
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, once again, I didn't see any
of the music, none of the bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get talked about people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it wasn't as, it wasn't as good as
it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be recreational, recreational fucked
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I always say that I'm not,
I'm not a fan of recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, Oh my God, how can you not be
a fan of recreational?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, no, I'm a fan of, of,
of decriminalization, not recreation
[SPEAKER_00]: because that integration allows fucking
big pharma and decriminalization would
[SPEAKER_00]: have kept it fucking mom and pop,
but too late now with the fuckers or
[SPEAKER_00]: organs sitting on six years of fucking
weed right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we haven't even fucking come to crop
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're sitting on six years supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do with the six years supply?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you don't leave it on the fucking
shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to blast that shit in oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six years from now, that weed is going to
be brown frowned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll make some, uh, very top shelf cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's why, you know,
and to that, you know, kooky Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they also pass legislation to try and
export weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what did it pass?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they've got it written.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says they can export to different
States.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's what the broke is a,
that'll probably be bad for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause Oregon is, you know, they have the
demand of, of 300,000 in the supply for 3
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like LA has the supply for 300,000,
the demand of 3 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so logistics are reversed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sounds like if you knew what you were
doing and you set up an op in LA,
[SPEAKER_05]: like it, you know, like why would it not
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much what I've come to see or what
I've come to hear is that, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems to, you know, it's just anywhere
you can buy weed easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, is pretty much where it's,
where it's been.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the California market came and went
very fucking quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just, you knew it would,
I think, um, I didn't think it'd go this
[SPEAKER_00]: quick, but it, it came and went and I,
I avoided it like the fucking plague.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a, it's a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of, you know, it's saddens me
cause a lot of, a lot of good people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to lose good money because they're
going to get fucking swallowed or because
[SPEAKER_00]: the price is going to get too,
too low where they can't afford.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it just doesn't make money to
continue to produce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 600 a pound, you know, fucking,
they can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, buck 50 grams and I can be able
to take that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, so a lot of, a lot of good people
are going to lose money on farms because I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that, you know, because the guys are
doing a big or doing a hundred million
[SPEAKER_00]: style, you know, you're talking 10
greenhouses all fucking online with custom
[SPEAKER_00]: controls and virtual integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to be able to slaughter
three weed to wherever mom and pop who
[SPEAKER_00]: thought they had the money to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to try their fucking
damndest, but when the price gets too low
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a fucking bummer today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, it kind of plays into the next
question in the way that like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the mom and pops are being
forced out in a sense, but like recently
[SPEAKER_05]: we saw, and you almost referenced it
earlier, like Seth Rogan has brought out
[SPEAKER_05]: that whole houseplant line and it kind of
seems inevitable that more and more
[SPEAKER_05]: celebrities will embrace cannabis and try
to carve their own little spot in the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think there'll come a time when
they kind of get it right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do you feel like kind of like a lot of
parts of the cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_05]: you've got to kind of have paid your dues
before you can do that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd never think they'll get it right
unless they're doing it for the right
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I never, I never hope people get
it right unless you're doing it for the
[SPEAKER_00]: right reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't think that, you know,
Joe Blow off the street who's been,
[SPEAKER_00]: not to say Joe Blow, because his name is
Joe Rogan, not to say that the guy doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know his cannabis, but he may not be as
schooled in the knowledge of fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as somebody else's who's been in
the industry a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as I'm sure that person's not as
fucking schooled as schooled in fight
[SPEAKER_00]: technique or as in talking about stuff or
in interviewing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once again, stay in your own
fucking lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you want to get behind a
product and brand it or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: do something for that, then, you know,
you got to pay the person to play the
[SPEAKER_00]: game.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's, if you're just going to get
into something, just to make money off of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, then you kind of, I don't know,
I don't, you want to, yes, things have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be made for a profit, but people did this
shit when it wasn't profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we have to remember is
that there will come a time when the
[SPEAKER_00]: shit's so low, we kind of forget what
people went through to fucking get us
[SPEAKER_00]: where we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes to kind of, I don't know,
talking about people, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure customers buy that, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the new website launch,
we're going to put up a lot of photos,
[SPEAKER_00]: which include me and all the breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that stands out between me and
just about every other bank is that I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally know every single breeder on my
bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have their cell phone numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can call them on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd fucking answer the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call me on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd answer the phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good relationship with all my
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucking hard to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at him and say, all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, yeah, all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met all my guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to look and re-state that
statement since I've added, I haven't met
[SPEAKER_00]: him yet, and I haven't met Pioneer Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, I've met just all my
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which gets me back to the, none of my 40
guys use the same mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's important to support and fund
the guys who did it when they shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have been doing it, if you know what I
mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like who took the risks and who risked
fucking jail time and their families and
[SPEAKER_00]: their freedom basically to, yes,
to profit, but as well to fucking,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to push the plant and to breed
and to continue doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you need to reward the people
who took the risk in the old days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of it's easy though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, you can just go and buy
anybody's cross through base thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, especially,
you know, hopefully all the breeders will
[SPEAKER_00]: pick up licensing deals and they'll be
with branded cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, with all the states coming
off weird, if you don't, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to, you know, Missouri and are going to
get cookies and cream off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to be the same that it
tasted like in fucking Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's not going to be the same as it
tasted like in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's unfortunate, but they're going
to be able to say it's cookies and cream
[SPEAKER_00]: because they got a 10 pack and they popped
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not really the true
representation of what, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Exotic may want them to fucking,
you know, use those cookies and cream or
[SPEAKER_00]: say that is this is cookies and cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because by giving something bad a good
name doesn't change the fact that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means more people are going to
say, yeah, I had that and it was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the futures talk kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I see that being a thing
that you want to go to a different state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have the same thing that you
smoked or that you're used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not, you're not smoking is
something that, and this goes back to Crap
[SPEAKER_00]: King, which I'll just beat on him some
more like we did last year or last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you buy fucking blueberry,
you want it to be DJ shorts blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just, I'm not a mind reader,
but when people ask me for blueberry,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm nine tenths out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure that they don't want
fucking Crap King's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want the blueberry that came from DJ
short that tastes like blueberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just the one that comes in different
packages that says blueberry on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's kind of marketing,
you know, like all of our stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: generally what says on the package is what
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's, you can't, can't think the
funk as was told to me once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's important that people,
when they buy their, when they buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: product or buy a flower that they support,
you know, breeders and brands and
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing deals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something I wanted to run by you though.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen it happen, you know,
sporadically, but do you think that we
[SPEAKER_05]: will see pollen being sold going forward?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do you think that'll change the
landscape of things if it happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I sell to a guy now, James Kerr,
who's in Canada and he does pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sends out pollen crosses stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, for the, your, your
interview with breeder Steve was really
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, I like breeder Steve that I love
his, his premise where just says,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just fucking plant a seed,
just so long as it's a seed, just fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care where you got it,
just plant it in the ground, get it wet,
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking make it explode, like get a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that that is, is really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so for the home breeder who wants
to do stuff, great, you know, buy some
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen and fucking breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, you get your own mail,
make your own fucking pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not that big of a deal as far
as people selling their pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know that when colabs, certain
colabs have happened, that there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of pollen that has been given is,
is very, is weighed, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very scrutinized because with pollen,
you can do anything with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when people are giving it up their
pollen to make a colab, let's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like there's not a lot going
there because the breeder doesn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: because once again, the only thing that
separates all 40 guys is their mails.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have my pollen, then you
can, you can do what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need my shit anymore if you got
my mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think, I don't see the
breeders giving out pollen with their
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know DJ Shortz talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Duns talked about put them in
different packages, but as, as,
[SPEAKER_00]: as highly guarded as the mails are that I,
I mean, as, as that's the only thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes people unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we all start with the same gorilla
with four cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cut you have is most likely the cut I
have if they're legit cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's all just a branch of a branch
of a branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always have a fucking unique seed or
a different, you know, it's the same
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking thing, just cloned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and so what makes it different is
the mail that we use with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though I may have a same mail,
that's the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's genetically not the same mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if my wife and me had a kid and I
died, I got hit by a bus.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife and my brother couldn't make
another kid that was as good looking as my
[SPEAKER_00]: current kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just, it's just genetically not
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you'll get close to kind of like most
likely of, but it's not genetically
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to duplicate without the same
mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is what makes people
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see it happening on a,
at least by breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm not selling you the thing
that I'm doing because then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was taken across with
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just to jump back to a point you
spoke about earlier in regards to the
[SPEAKER_05]: forums you've got going.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen a few forums pop up recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capulator having... Copy my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the idea and they fucking need to
copy it within the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, why do you think we're seeing
these forums pop up?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think it is about the forum
that people are missing and why don't you
[SPEAKER_05]: see it taking off more quickly?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the forums are probably back up
because Mark Zuckerberg fucking hates
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going through the genocide right
now of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if Instagram and Facebook can
delete all these videos and take down all
[SPEAKER_00]: these pictures and accounts, then we'll
basically delete the history of the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who did it to get where we are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 10 years from now, you'll be able
to Google a grow video or you won't be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to find out any of this information
because YouTube fucking took down the
[SPEAKER_00]: channel or blocked the account or erased
all the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most of us don't print out our
pictures on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have fucking copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when Instagram bleeds the account,
that's everybody's history and on it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that they're just...
Because we've been shut down 17 times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our Instagram sucks right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my Instagram guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it sucks because we have fucking
handcuffs on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we can't do nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get told if there's a price anywhere in
the picture, we fucking will get flagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do any type of video, we get
flagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I put up videos now and they're
fucking seriously flagged within like five
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up and it's automatically boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Community standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how did you even already... So my
account is supposed to be being watched.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, our current Instagram account
has like six items on it because we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: keep anything on it and we can't go back
to our history and shut us down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's no way to document your
online presence if you're not using an
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram account to fucking save your
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that on the forums that
people like myself and Cap have that I own
[SPEAKER_00]: the servers that they're on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the servers backed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where I always have that history,
I'm not going to delete accounts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like a preservation thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you don't just lose everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what people are looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of get back to the forums and the
days where they could grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also maybe the novelty of,
yeah, yay, it's California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grow weed now, but I don't know how
to fucking grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I grow weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think people are also looking to
reach out and find that and not get the
[SPEAKER_00]: trolls that are on Instagram and the drama
that's on Instagram, but still seek the
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge of how do I grow this out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a grower's perspective,
and from a British perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do I put my information out there and
make sure that it's not going to get taken
[SPEAKER_00]: down or make sure that it's not,
you know, all these conversations and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these grow tips I've been giving people
aren't just going to be fucking deleted
[SPEAKER_00]: one day because somebody was pissed off at
me.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, I think we're going to see
more of the forum rise anyway,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's, you can't track a story on
Instagram over a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's, that's what a thread does
perfectly on a forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we just have to get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's gotta have a good web
app.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think forums could definitely work,
but people have to be able to scroll from
[SPEAKER_00]: their phone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be more accessible because
forums were so cumbersome on a phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, have you or have you yet to see
something that's truly kind of unique and
[SPEAKER_05]: just truly coming out of left of field?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like what's, what have we got to
get excited about that's not recycled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everything that my new guys have
they're putting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all new and fucking exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of questions that kill me here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, everybody's new releases are all going
to be new and not recycled and fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, before, well, before we're on
that note, I would just like to say that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, my name is James B and I'm a
broker for the following brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aficionado, Archive, Best Coast,
Big Island, Bog Seeds, Canterado,
[SPEAKER_00]: Coastal Seed, Crockett Family,
Dirty Water Organics, DJ Short Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dominion Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dezotic Genetics, Freeborn Selection,
Grandpa Bud Seeds, Green Fire Genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Light Genetics, Green Team Genetics,
Green Skull Seeds, Homegrown Natural
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonders, Humboldt Seed Company,
Irish Genetics, Karma Genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cat Seed Seeds, Lafayette Labs,
Loud Seeds, Like a Dog Seed, Man Farmer
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics, Massive Seeds, Mephisto,
Microtech, Miss Jill, Obsolete,
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific Northwest Roots, Relentless,
Riot, Sage Master Selects, Second
[SPEAKER_00]: Generation Genetics, Sea Junkie,
Sirius Seeds, Snow High, Soulfire,
[SPEAKER_00]: Swamp Boys, Swamp Donkey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jade Seeds, The Seed Company, Thud Pug,
Thunder Fudge, Top Dog, and last but not
[SPEAKER_00]: least, Utopia Farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: What a plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned them all and thank you very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And please don't blow up my phone because
I didn't mention you on the phone,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're so popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I didn't mention you on the show,
a lot of my guys would give me shit last
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, oh, you didn't say
anything about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, I was thinking about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so now I said them all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, this is the equivalent of like mom
saying, I love all my children.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my children equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing about us.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to another breeder at his
booth, he's going to want to sell you his
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff if he's any good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and he can't blame.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he's there to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pay for his fucking booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to sell you his seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come to me at a booth and I don't
have all my guns because I don't sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my things is if I won't sell
seeds at the same show that my breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if my breeder is taking money out
of his pocket, he's there at a booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pull his genetics off my table and
refer people to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like at the Emerald Cup,
if you come up to me and say you want the
[SPEAKER_00]: best land raised fucking sativa that I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I know that I'd love to sell you
something that I have on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, if I point out to you to go
to walk down to Snow High's fucking booth
[SPEAKER_00]: and tell him that you want a Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got 17 weeks to waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not biased on any particular
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was here to make sure you find a strain
that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not here to push one brand or the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want, that's the nice thing about
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something gassy, I got fucking
40 brands to pick from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's find a gassy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just, we're not just focused on
one specific goal or one type of thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nice thing about all these breeders is
they all breed for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all breeders because they're
fucking crazy, but they all look for
[SPEAKER_00]: different things when they breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's short as a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's tri-comb production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's fucking squash sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who the fuck knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they all breed for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes them all unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially in their own unique way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got fucking stoned again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot what we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, all the different brands are
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's fun to, you know,
I used to get orders and I'd see like a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack of Exotic and then a pack of Snow
High.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, man, that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the guy who's buying Exotic,
which is pretty much, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: dense nugs, frosty fucking, you know,
sunshine or, and grabs a pack of Snow
[SPEAKER_00]: High, which will be like a land race
Alcapulco Gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, man, that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's, you know, very opposite end
of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, that Alcapulco Gold
is fun to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some Bode's gear, some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be good on a giant scale or on
a big scale, but if you like growing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and are excited just to see
different things, and what Mother Nature
[SPEAKER_00]: can do and just love the fucking plant,
different breeders have different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, with you use land races,
those grow distinctively different than
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's been seriously worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by growing them out, you'd be like,
oh yeah, I can see where that would need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's why you cross it with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's a bitch and that's,
I don't like it by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you would want to cross it to
make this or I see why that person bred
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he wanted to make it, you know,
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like genetics and just like
growing, grow different people's seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like don't get just stuck on one breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great, great message.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we are basically onto the
tail end of things now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to start to do some of our
more quick fire answers before we get to
[SPEAKER_05]: the last final.
[SPEAKER_05]: But how can a new breeder go about trying
to get your attention?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of the things they should be
doing to be ticking the boxes?
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be, and for first of all,
foremost, once again, I'm a nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just run a bank and I had an idea like
in 2010 where I could help my friend and
[SPEAKER_00]: have taken certain steps and certain risks
and rewards and have done certain things
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a broker for certain cannabis
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do nothing more than I'm just a
broker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so I do try to keep things in line
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to add, to add you to our phone,
to our seed bank, of course, first and
[SPEAKER_00]: foremost, generally it's nice to have good
customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a dick, then if people don't
like you, that's, that's, that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we don't want to bring on those
customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, some guys you may have had on
the show are a dick and they're not the
[SPEAKER_00]: best customer service guys, but we still
support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but you want to have, generally you
want your customer base to like you
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's who, that's who at the end
of the day buys your backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys that you work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be using your own mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even if so-and-so gave you permission
to use his shit, well now you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: giving credit to two different guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they want to make that cross in my
eyes, they could have made that cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they didn't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they do, then let them make money
off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find your own mail as, as, as minimal
or as weird as it may seem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's at least showed the industry,
the people that are buying that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's unique to you and that
you've done something on the, on the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've looked into it some somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I don't think it's good to
copy other people's shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's cool to, you know,
copy this with that and just call it this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think you should have the
genetic thing and have the, as,
[SPEAKER_00]: as, as well, as much as you know at the
time that this was real, that you breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and make it, make it so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to mislead people is wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much that you just gotta be,
you know, most likely, I don't know if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to get my attention,
it's too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I, I, I, I'm not really,
I mean, but that being said, when I,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I went looking for new banks,
I got, you know, five that were suggested
[SPEAKER_00]: to us that were, you know, really good
guys that I'd just been sleeping on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I don't know everybody and
it's not, it's not the, it's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: golden ticket to be on the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You still, all my guys in the bank still
promote their gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still have to, have to promote your
seed, your stuff and build your clientele
[SPEAKER_00]: base and interact with your clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, that's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if, you know, people buy gear,
they want to interact with the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to talk to the guy who did the
thing or get his, his, his insight on how
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if breeders would interact
with their clientele base more,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd maybe have more sales and be more
successful in certain areas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: A bit of good PR doesn't, doesn't hurt at
all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think now we're onto our super quick
last one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's bang out these ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the most memorable Australian
you've ever smoked?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherbills.
[SPEAKER_05]: So say that one again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherbills.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherbert and Fruity Pebbles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a green Fino and there's a
purple Fino and it's still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like the first two people,
like one of them was the guy at the gas
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you didn't even know his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, he was just the guy at the gas
store, but he would, he'd always hit me up
[SPEAKER_00]: for herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I just like popped the case on
it and he was like, cereal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cereal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fruity Pebbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second guy did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really know you got something when you
tell, when they tell you what it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's called before.
[SPEAKER_00]: You even have to tell them like Fruity
Pebbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, yep, that's fucking it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the opposite end of the spectrum,
what is the worst strain you've ever
[SPEAKER_05]: smoked?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we're on a fucking hate project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Candy rain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you smoked it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people brought some to Mike's booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, I took photos of it next
to everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it was, you know,
it wasn't the grower because grower had
[SPEAKER_00]: brought other things in with him as well,
but it was just sad.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bummer.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, dude, I'm even impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got one to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I heard it was two out of 35.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, the numbers don't lie.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're on a desert Island and you
could only take three strains with you,
[SPEAKER_05]: what three?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've played this game before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have to be all witty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have said, like, you know,
I'm a breeder, so I'm supposed to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a worker guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's supposed to be like land race and
shit, like Northern Lights and Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I could make everything else from
it, but I can't because I'm not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say that I'd say the witty thing,
the way I could make everything else from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know the witty thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably take Sheryl's with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably stick with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know for a third one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thin mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, never, never, never, never.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably, probably can be just because
it's very potent.
[SPEAKER_05]: She does hit the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knocks me the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I know that you used to be a grower,
as you revealed in our last discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to know what is the one clone
that you used to grow out and you just
[SPEAKER_05]: miss not having that weed around anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I miss not having my weed around
anymore, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you're growing, you fucking like
trim gel happens and you guys do trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: and you hate life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, God, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you say like, I'll never miss
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like there's times I miss trim gel and
I miss just going out in the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: just sitting out there with the fans on
and with the tables going and just sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and just thinking like I miss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do miss that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People probably take that for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, I go fucking water my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's really something
between, you know, plants and humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think every kid, like in school,
I think they should fucking grow plants
[SPEAKER_00]: just to get that responsibility and that
knowledge that if you don't come home and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not, if you don't water this
thing, it's going to fucking die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think there's that kind of
synopsis is really cool, which are plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I miss that clone would be probably
the Romulan and Romulan way back when I
[SPEAKER_00]: was DJ and I had it and deep water
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I flew out to do a gig over New
Year's and I had to put chains on to get
[SPEAKER_00]: out of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tree had fallen over my front yard and
shut the power off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, if you're in deep water culture
and in fucking Tahoe and the tree fell
[SPEAKER_00]: over because it was covered in snow,
well, all your fucking water froze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those plants died a cold,
cold death.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to salvage nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pumps turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants died.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I decided, OK, you're going to
be DJ or you're going to be fucking weed
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to go to Seattle and open up a
weed or a grow store, a garden center,
[SPEAKER_00]: as I was supposed to be called.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You made the right choice by the looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ scene was getting played out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all fake and not cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting played out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fucking people would kill me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's me and Duke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, me and Duke have alluded to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a little extra juicy gossip
at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a strain that we're going to
release next year at MJBizCon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Duke, you're going to get mad at me for
putting it out there, but it's the it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the pre thirty seven dust bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit's fucking drought resistant
mold, mildew resistant like you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking water this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so strong in thirty two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they made it illegal in thirty
seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that shit's been gone like off the
face of the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all we have is this new watered down
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like if you get that pre thirty two
before they made it illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Duke's got a line on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to sell this bitch next
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: MJBizCon put on some suits, shiny sushi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoes sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know people have talked ever been
talked in the past about the thirty two
[SPEAKER_00]: dust bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's out of the wagon now.
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I think that might be the perfect
note to end it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just bullshit, really.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that being said, do you have any
shout out to comments you'd like to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go through all my greeters again,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you cut and paste,
insert that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: For working with us and trusting with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please know and trust that if your breeder
is fucking with us, then they trust us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know that we're selling their gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with all these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask them about us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't be working with me if it
wasn't if it wasn't good for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't good for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wouldn't be a good guy if I
didn't have all the trust I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I'd like to shout out my office
team, everyone from my mom who works
[SPEAKER_00]: customer service lines, to Bear,
to Rebel, to Dusty, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: to Heather, to Rob, my sales guys,
my trade show team, all those guys that go
[SPEAKER_00]: to work every day and manage the office
and get all the boxes out where they need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank all my legal team for
fucking with the bullshit, keeping people
[SPEAKER_00]: off my ass, keeping the haters away with
the hater aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank Trump for fucking up the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nonpolitical, though, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to thank you for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really, I'm just like I said,
people give me more credit than I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I just need to give myself more
credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just started this to help a buddy in
2010 and just proceeded to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was thinking about it earlier this
morning, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as I dislike this other person
that I started for, and I will not give
[SPEAKER_00]: him any name mentioned, therefore not
giving him anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I learned things from him that I
continue to use this day as far as what I
[SPEAKER_00]: think is good and bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where last time I was on the show,
me and Matt Riot weren't friends,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you see he's on my bank, and he talks
good about me, and I talk good about Matt
[SPEAKER_00]: Riot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy's passionate about what he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean everybody fucking agrees with
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean everybody likes him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is he passionate about what he feels,
and is he putting out work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: My original breeder, so the guy I first
started with for three years, four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to give his name any
credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, like I said, learn things I use
this day that help me in my ethics as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as business goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as can't use other people's stuff,
and you can't rename things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He taught me a lot of those things that I
still use, that I still consider holy,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although he turned out to be unholy and a
dick.
[SPEAKER_00]: His methods, once again, like all
breeders, his methods in trying to relay
[SPEAKER_00]: his message were not the greatest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he meant right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he can take something from everybody,
even people you don't like, and people
[SPEAKER_00]: years down the road that you hate,
but you can still learn something from
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most definitely, I agree wholeheartedly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, with that, we might wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much again for taking some
time out of your busy schedule to come
[SPEAKER_05]: chat with us, Mr. Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, and I appreciate you

[SPEAKER_00]: always having to show up.

do as well.
