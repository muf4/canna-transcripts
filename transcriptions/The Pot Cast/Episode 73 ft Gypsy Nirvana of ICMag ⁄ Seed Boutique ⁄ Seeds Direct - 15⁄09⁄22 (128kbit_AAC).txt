[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for joining us today Hello,
how would you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do well my friend how you doing this
morning?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting on this lovely balcony is It's
dawning in the UK looking out over blue
[SPEAKER_01]: sky but looks a bit Things are green and
Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess kind of flattered that somebody
would want to ask me some questions about
[SPEAKER_01]: my illustrious and and many faceted life
You nodded on the head many faceted is to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of not even do it justice but a
question we love to start off Most
[SPEAKER_00]: interviews with is what are you been
smoking on lately?
[SPEAKER_01]: Moroccan hash it's kind of what I started
with when I first started smoking cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: way back in the Stone Age 1975 something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I was 15 and my brother had some
Moroccan hash and we rolled it up in a
[SPEAKER_01]: spliff with a bit of tobacco and we smoked
it and it seems that You kind of revert
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm going through a second childhood
because after all this these heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: indicators and You know soaring high
sativas To come to some sort of regular
[SPEAKER_01]: daily constant and keeper kind of a level
head as much as you can I Come down to
[SPEAKER_01]: what I started with which is a Moroccan
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful and how does that one compared
to the stuff you have in your childhood?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's similar or quite
different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's it's not too strong and it's
not too mine We used to have much milder
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff called slate Moroccan Back then that
was the cheapest stuff and that was
[SPEAKER_01]: harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a kind of soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just break it off Crumble it up
like that very simple But yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't you know, I've been a consummate
cannabis Stoner user whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: call me most all of my life and I find
that finding something that Is consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: on a daily basis doesn't knock me up too
high or put me down too low keeps me on a
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of level that I can cope with Is the
best for me is when I mix them up that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have the problem particularly a couple of
weeks ago I was over in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_01]: interviewing a few Quite well respected
breeders and people in the seed industry
[SPEAKER_01]: over there Soma being one of them and he
knocked me out with some of his soma salad
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble hash So, you know, you can really
overdo it on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the amount of THC you consume
Everybody's got you know Their tolerance
[SPEAKER_01]: levels and for me I try to keep them not
too high and not too low But as soon as
[SPEAKER_01]: you you try something extra strong You're
gone, you know, I literally I was out cold
[SPEAKER_01]: About a minute came around again But in
that day I tried all these other varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: to weed and actually kind of Knocks you
out eventually doesn't matter how How
[SPEAKER_01]: strong you think you are or how much you
can combat the THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has limitations That's brilliant
and I guess as a follower in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: would you say you're more of like a flower
guy or you're more into your concentrates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends, you know, I'll take what I can
get You know if there's nothing going,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know a lot of the times the users
don't get to choose they just They just
[SPEAKER_01]: take whatever the guy has that has some
you know, whether it's a dealer or a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend or Whoever the passes do some weed
or you grow it yourself That's what you
[SPEAKER_01]: cope with at the time it's not as if we
have the choice of selection of some areas
[SPEAKER_01]: and say the United States to with all
their dispensaries and what have You so
[SPEAKER_01]: generally, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find hash is more compact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's much easier to To deal with weed
is generally smellier And and more bulky
[SPEAKER_01]: so depends if you're traveling or not
generally for traveling hashes the best
[SPEAKER_01]: and It's nice to have a bit a bit of both
If you were at home, you know to have as
[SPEAKER_00]: much choice as possible Certainly I can
appreciate that I would be interested to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear though.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on the current UK
scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know these days it feels like by all
accounts It seems to be really flourishing
[SPEAKER_00]: and the law enforcement is taking a bit
more of a relaxed approach to it How do
[SPEAKER_00]: you feel about the UK scene at the moment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know I'm not really with the
in crowd or if there is an in crowd I live
[SPEAKER_01]: a quite a quiet life these days and after
the mad shenanigans of the past decade
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of settled down with my wife and two
kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get too involved I go to bed at
nine o'clock at night, you know I'm up
[SPEAKER_01]: early in the morning like now So I'm not
so sure which way they're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really involved with any
Organizations I never have been Never been
[SPEAKER_01]: a member of any organization as far as I
can remember No unions no political
[SPEAKER_01]: parties No, maybe a book club once So,
I mean take me back then what was your
[SPEAKER_00]: childhood like what was the progression
like for you to get into cannabis more
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously Well try and encapsulate it in a
in the short space of time as possible I
[SPEAKER_01]: was born down the river from here where I
am in Kingston now in Chertsey in a field
[SPEAKER_01]: in a caravan in a rainstorm and I grew up
kind of on the fringe of society I went to
[SPEAKER_01]: a state sync school after being thrown out
of a boarding school Yeah, and They said I
[SPEAKER_01]: was maladjusted They when I was in my
early teens they took me to for
[SPEAKER_01]: psychological evaluation or whatever and
then they gave me these pills I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: was haloperidol or something like that and
it made me go a bit kind of veggie and a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit bonkers and I didn't like it and Yeah,
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It calmed me down, but it turned me into a
vegetable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't like that It didn't take them
for very long and about that same time a
[SPEAKER_01]: brother was experimenting with my Rock and
hash and that seemed to work Calm me down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know when you go through your
teens you get a big release.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was testosterone or whatever
makes you You know more prone to Explosive
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes or whatever it is then so they
took that as being some sort of way to say
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was not correct psychologically and
gave me the pill And it didn't work and I
[SPEAKER_01]: found cannabis and it did work So it's
helped me mentally during that period and
[SPEAKER_01]: later on when I've had injuries and what
have you and other things I Wouldn't say
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a great painkiller, but it kind of
takes your mind off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you a bit sillier So it kind of
cheers you up You can laugh yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: easier It's good to be able to do that
Most certainly so as far as it being a
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit to me and Yeah, I'd say it has
been it's not killed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got me into a lot of trouble Well,
look I'd be interested to delve into all
[SPEAKER_00]: of that But I remember when I read this
Guardian article about you It said at one
[SPEAKER_00]: point you were a roadie for the clash Was
that when you were younger and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: before you got heavily involved in the
seed scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I grew up for the kind of my teen
years were in the 70s and I'm a Londoner
[SPEAKER_01]: so I was very close to the whole punk
scene when that came about and I used to
[SPEAKER_01]: hang around the back of the hundred club
and other venues like the Nashville in
[SPEAKER_01]: London and various other pubs where bands
were playing and You know this whole This
[SPEAKER_01]: whole punk thing seemed like a new way
that these guys around my age were a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit older who were Addressing in
odd clothing We're rebelling against
[SPEAKER_01]: society and during the 70s.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a big depression then particularly
amongst the working classes and There
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't much else to do But go to gigs and
jump up and down and act fool We had a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of fun and Some of these bands I started
helping them with their equipment And
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing a bit of roadie work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just really donkey work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a big Marshall stacks around
various other Items for the public address
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted to set up whatever You know
hall University pub all over the UK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of worked as a roadie for a
Couple of bands the adverts I worked for
[SPEAKER_01]: for a while and then I worked for a couple
of gigs with the pistols and then when I
[SPEAKER_01]: went to the States in 1977 I moved to the
USA and the clash came over in 1980 and
[SPEAKER_01]: found me in San Francisco One of their
gigs and then they asked me to work for
[SPEAKER_01]: them the US tour Because I was just about
to join the US Marine Corps and they
[SPEAKER_01]: talked me out of it I did it did a few
gigs with Emma across the States and then
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up Going down to New Orleans
because early Dorsey who was supporting
[SPEAKER_01]: the clash on that tour It invited me down
there because he had an auto paint and
[SPEAKER_01]: fender shop And he gave me a job spraying
cars, which it wasn't very good at But
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of much along and then got a job in
Old Man Rivers and some honky-tonk down
[SPEAKER_01]: there as a security At the door Did that
for a while?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a New Orleans adventure and came
back to New York and worked for a band
[SPEAKER_01]: called Rockabilly band called Levi and
Rockettes They played CBGBs Max's Kansas
[SPEAKER_01]: City Lone Star Cafe This is going back
Ways anyway, I was kind of mixed up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: music industry from a perspective of
somebody who worked security were
[SPEAKER_01]: backstage security for the clash And from
stage to stop people climbing on the stage
[SPEAKER_01]: When the band was on the stage There's
some really crazy events not least one at
[SPEAKER_01]: the Santa Monica Civic Where I saw this
guy getting paled on the one of the four
[SPEAKER_01]: by twos on the buttress the wooden
buttress at the front of the stage And it
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of turned me off the whole thing I
didn't like crowds anymore Get away from
[SPEAKER_01]: that Ended up coming back to the UK
eventually and stayed here for a while
[SPEAKER_01]: worked in a British wine factory of all
places For nine months and then decided to
[SPEAKER_01]: take off to Asia once again bought a car
and drove through Europe Ended up in Crete
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a job as a minder for an American
property developer and ended up in him and
[SPEAKER_01]: his missus Took me over to Bangkok Yeah,
one thing led to another The guy was crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up in Hong Kong for a while back
in 1980 early 1980s and traveled all over
[SPEAKER_01]: Asia doing various smuggling runs and
Worked for a while in the entertainment
[SPEAKER_01]: industry in Hong Kong Usually is in the
martial arts kind of action movie area is
[SPEAKER_01]: in bloodsport Did bionic ninja and all
these kind of B or C class movies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are just hilarious Go on to
YouTube and Google bionic ninja And you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: see me back in 1980s Was it five or six?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jumping around in Kowloon Park or in some
kind of container port out near the new
[SPEAKER_01]: territories in Hong Kong that was a crazy
crazy days Back in Asia, but all the time
[SPEAKER_01]: I was traveling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always looking for the best hash or
the best weed and Sometimes it came with
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always thought it was a good way to
Get cannabis around the world was to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to be a fave of seed Somebody that
could find something that was different
[SPEAKER_01]: where somebody was trying to make
something new They might use it in the mix
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so fascinating to hear that,
you know the whole while you're always
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for the best hash and the best
seeds Were you collecting seeds that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would later sell or was it more like
you're collecting the experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would allow you to later sell the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think What really opened the door was
the internet with weed base?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, which came up with it was a
cyber where growers could communicate
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders from around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just pre-overgrowth and guys from
that side set up overgrown around 2000 I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it was 22 years ago and then enable
people, you know with a like mindset to
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate internationally, I'm gonna go
back in cycles and Bloody shivering out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I know it's dropped to about 12
centigrade man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Wow, that is chilly, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess then I would be interested in
asking what was it that stimulated you to
[SPEAKER_00]: think you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna start selling seeds myself Well,
I it wasn't until I think 1985 When I got
[SPEAKER_01]: into some trouble over a bit of hash I was
I had a fiance who was in Holland and I
[SPEAKER_01]: would regularly visit her and of course I
go to a coffee shop and I'd pick up a
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of hash and I'd bring it back to the
UK with me, you know after the visit and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think It was about the eighth trip this
spring of Spaniel stood in front of me and
[SPEAKER_01]: then sat down and Gave me this really
stoned look from this customs agent at
[SPEAKER_01]: Harwich, you know because I was on the
boat from the look then Holland to Harwich
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I had a customs check and they
found some hash in the jacket pocket as
[SPEAKER_01]: always I would carry a bit but not enough
to assume that I was Intending to supply
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody and it's just kind of personal So
that ended me up in jail because I refused
[SPEAKER_01]: to pay a fine or do any community service
Anyway, it was a terrible jail experience
[SPEAKER_01]: and I thought I've got to do something
about these stupid laws So, what do you
[SPEAKER_01]: do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a Kalashnikov in a bomb and run around
acting like a terrorist.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't think that's gonna work.
[SPEAKER_01]: No You know, you become a target very
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I Just thought that cannabis is a
beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people have only heard bad news about
it It's been portrayed as being some sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of evil Let's get it growing in in
thousands of gardens worldwide hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands maybe even millions of gardens
So, how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get it growing and then people see
the benefit of the plant They use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they use they eat the seeds,
you know, or maybe they use the flanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they they You know make a medicine
out of it Maybe they get high on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It benefits society in some way or another
but society isn't gonna know that unless
[SPEAKER_01]: they see the plant growing or they have
the Access and the ability to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow that plant So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to give people that so you have
to have the seeds the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute them and You also it helps to
have the education and the know-how how to
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate plant As well as you can So what
you need you need a website to explain
[SPEAKER_01]: that so people can interact so we did that
with IC mag and The seeds you need a seed
[SPEAKER_01]: site and a lot of our policy well my
policy from the start Was the main idea
[SPEAKER_01]: was to get people growing wasn't to make
lots of money from people You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so the impetus was from the start to give
people a good deal on the seeds Make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're not crazily priced if
possible unless the breeders first of all
[SPEAKER_01]: pricing them so hard You know,
then obviously you've got to make a cut on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of that But and then giving away kilos
of free seeds along with the orders On
[SPEAKER_01]: condition that people would share them
with others and this is what happened So
[SPEAKER_01]: for every order that went out,
it wasn't just for that person to grow It
[SPEAKER_01]: was intended for somebody else as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of one grower you get maybe two
people kept to know their pledge of
[SPEAKER_01]: spreading the seeds So it seemed to work
and over many years now, I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry has grown Expedentially,
it's it's huge now in comparison to what
[SPEAKER_01]: it was back in the 70s and 80s When I
started out getting involved with it in
[SPEAKER_01]: one way or another That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you ever have like a conscious
thought?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to speak that like hey this journey I'm
on I may not be the grower to change the
[SPEAKER_00]: world But I could play another role and
help change things or was it did it never
[SPEAKER_00]: occur to you that the ripples would spread
that wide and you just sort of thought you
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing your own little thing and it
Wouldn't cause the effects it did Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I always enjoyed growing I mean it's
wonderful thing, you know, I love having
[SPEAKER_01]: plants around me but to do it well and to
be a Breeder you've got a Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're kind of tied to one place Generally
well Would be you'd have to unless you're
[SPEAKER_01]: one of these jet-set breeders who can do
everything over the internet Can even feed
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants every day, you know But now I
haven't seen so many successful situations
[SPEAKER_01]: with people that try to automate their
whole systems Generally, you have to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: one place all the time And even if you go
on holiday, you're worried sick that when
[SPEAKER_01]: you come back all your plants are gonna be
dead So I know you know the the mentality
[SPEAKER_01]: of a grower and a breeder So I you know,
I do grow a bit but but not really to the
[SPEAKER_01]: extent that you would need to grow to be a
breeder I mean people like Sam skunk man
[SPEAKER_01]: think you need to grow out 10,000 plants
for selections To be in any sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: respected considered respected breeder in
the first place and who has the facility
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that and I think more people do
today than they did 10 or 20 years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the the Decriminalization and
legalization in some parts of the world
[SPEAKER_01]: now But you know still most of the world
is is growing In a illegal light to a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain extent and You have to take this
into account.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just think that oh, it's it's
legal in the United States So,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can be really lackadaisical
with your own security.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a good idea Sometimes maybe I am
because I've only got three plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of tempting fate,
but Somehow you've got to work You've got
[SPEAKER_01]: to do something against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, people are growing more today
than ever they did and Hopefully I you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I was instrumental in in aiding that
somewhat in the past Wasn't just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's been a lot of a lot of
other people who've been distributing
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and Have a similar mindset and it's
a way of getting back at the authorities
[SPEAKER_01]: because now we have seen legislation Hit
home, you know in favor of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization Decriminalization worldwide
and and hopefully that will continue
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout all the Western nations and
then the rest of the world Accordingly,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's a very slow progression and I
say over my whole lifetime And I've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: it go from bad to worse to better and it's
Getting better And the UK now I really
[SPEAKER_01]: don't think the police are concerned as
long as you're not Causing a problem with
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you know, you're making a huge
business out of it We've got 250 stoners
[SPEAKER_01]: knocking on your door within a 24-hour
period I Mean on that topic in a sense Do
[SPEAKER_00]: you feel like you really paved the way for
people like say the attitude seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bank who are now arguably the biggest seed
bank in the world Yeah, well, I think in
[SPEAKER_01]: some respects I've kind of been The head
of the industry and been the one that's
[SPEAKER_01]: had his head banged against the door a few
times Okay, I kind of feel knocked out or
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it was quite a shock in 2013 I was
in a I had a house in Subic in Philippines
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I got told by my sister's brother
who was kind of our caretaker of the house
[SPEAKER_01]: That there was several guys with long guns
surrounding the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Long guns, I mean rifles,
you know, so I'm like, oh, what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: water?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we waited for the knock on the door
There was a knock on the door and they
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to take me to Manila.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the Bureau of Immigration And I
hadn't a clue what this was all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been living in the Philippines since
about 2006 7 and Had a family they had
[SPEAKER_01]: children there have my life there
everything and Suddenly they wanted to put
[SPEAKER_01]: me in this detention jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they drove me for a couple of hours
into Manila and dumped me in this really
[SPEAKER_01]: awful dump Dumped me in a dump that
smelled like a dump and Yeah there I lived
[SPEAKER_01]: for two and a half years After ten days of
being there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tried to kidnap me and do what's
called a extra judicial rendition by
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to force me onto a plane to Los
Angeles from Manila Nino Aquino
[SPEAKER_01]: International Airport, I think it was
terminal Terminal one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Of course, I Lucky enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was informed what they were attempting
to do by one of the other prisoners there
[SPEAKER_01]: He said that yeah, they'll try and do this
to you you need to resist and and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: don't need to get violent but you need to
try and stop them from shipping you over
[SPEAKER_01]: to the states because it's totally illegal
and Can only be done with your consent
[SPEAKER_01]: Because being British I'm not an American
subject so it shouldn't be subjected to
[SPEAKER_01]: American law their long arm of the law
overseas Their homeland security that
[SPEAKER_00]: seemed to operate outside their homeland
So how did you manage to foil this plan
[SPEAKER_00]: what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was it was a comedy of it was just
a comedy You say the comedy of errors I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really know but They took me there
and then before I went there I mean I had
[SPEAKER_01]: back then I had my back problem was a lot
worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this From doing some weight training
back in the 90s and over doing pulled some
[SPEAKER_01]: muscles and graded some bone and L1 and L2
vertebrae or something back so I had this
[SPEAKER_01]: enormous Back problem when they put me
into this jail and so I was taking quite
[SPEAKER_01]: strong medication for it and so when they
were kind of trying to cut me off to the
[SPEAKER_01]: airport I took a double dose and Then I
went to the airport and so I felt no pain
[SPEAKER_01]: at all and I had the attitude I didn't
care and I was very stoned and I just said
[SPEAKER_01]: to them, you know, this is illegal You can
do treat me as a punch bag or whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: like, but I'm not gonna put those
handcuffs on I put my hands above my head
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they stood on a chair to try and
reach because they're quite short the guys
[SPEAKER_01]: and Then I moved along and they couldn't
reach and we had this argument about them
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to put the cuffs on but eventually
I said look, I just want my lawyer and
[SPEAKER_01]: It's obvious to me that this is not being
done right judicially And I managed to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk them out of it without too much
Wrangling or any wrestling or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of worked out, but then they
took me back to this detention jail Can
[SPEAKER_01]: bug on Diva in Bikutan?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is kind of like a huge police camp
2,000 plus police surrounding you all
[SPEAKER_01]: living in barracks So So it's not easy to
get out of that place unless you got some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of SWAT team and a couple of
helicopters So I think I read in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Guardian article that you ended up
spending like about two and a half years
[SPEAKER_00]: there or so I was interested in asking
like what was that experience like?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you compare it to other jails
you'd been in and as a follow-up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it change your outlook at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not as if I've done a world
tour of jails, you know I think about only
[SPEAKER_01]: been in two in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one in Norwich for a month in
1985 in England and Then the two and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half years in the Philippines in Bikutan
But yeah, that was that place was
[SPEAKER_01]: something else I mean it wasn't a
traditional Filipino jail because the
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of the people in there were
actually foreigners It was a foreigners
[SPEAKER_01]: jail So you have people from all over the
world in there in all different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions physically and mentally you had
a mixture of guys that were thrown in
[SPEAKER_01]: there for various types of alleged crimes,
you know From as small as their girlfriend
[SPEAKER_01]: making a complaint that that he called her
a bad name, you know to Some guys that are
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in, you know, kitty fiddlers and
nonsists and people like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and then murderers between that
Con artists rapists, you name it came
[SPEAKER_01]: through that place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was It was a human criminal menagerie
Yeah, to put it bluntly and I spent most
[SPEAKER_01]: of my time in my bunk reading every book
in English that I could lay my hands on
[SPEAKER_01]: that was about it because I didn't really
want to mix and associate too much with
[SPEAKER_01]: the other prisoners I kind of kept away as
much as I could It was kind of it was open
[SPEAKER_01]: in in some respects Because the guards
weren't interfering all the time They
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much left the prisoners up to
controlling themselves So the guards just
[SPEAKER_01]: Were checking the gates that you weren't
allowed to go through or you were allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: to go through at different times They
weren't too intrusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only had one guard that tried to be a
little bit aggressive Towards me at one
[SPEAKER_00]: time So it could have been a lot worse And
what was it like in terms of when you
[SPEAKER_00]: finished your sentence?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you go back and live with your family
in the Philippines or did you go straight
[SPEAKER_00]: home to the UK?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I never had a sentence you see I
Never went if I never went to court was
[SPEAKER_01]: found guilty of anything All that happened
was the United States put out an
[SPEAKER_01]: indictment in their state of Maine saying
that they wanted me in connection with
[SPEAKER_01]: international Trade in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was only the seeds actually you
see but in the United States the seeds are
[SPEAKER_01]: the same as any part of the plant They can
say, you know, they can say you're an
[SPEAKER_01]: international Trafficker illegal
trafficker in narcotics, even if you are a
[SPEAKER_01]: seed salesman And this is all I was doing
was I was buying seeds from Americans And
[SPEAKER_01]: selling seeds to Americans and I was doing
it from the UK, which is perfectly legal
[SPEAKER_01]: place to do it from Because in the UK
there there is no laws against buying and
[SPEAKER_01]: selling of cannabis seeds So what happened
eventually?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I didn't want to leave my family
over there I tried to be able to stay in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Philippines because I thought if I
went back to the UK I would automatically
[SPEAKER_01]: be transported to the United States or
that there would be you know, this this
[SPEAKER_01]: this Extradition hearing and or there be a
trial and so it did happen eventually when
[SPEAKER_01]: I did return there was the United States
came after me after I was back for eight
[SPEAKER_01]: months in the UK and they took me to court
and after a year or so the court said no,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't have me because There's no dual
criminal criminality.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law is different here in the UK on
seeds as it is in the in the US So they
[SPEAKER_01]: can't extradite me for something legal in
the UK To somewhere where what I've done
[SPEAKER_01]: is illegal, which is in the USA But since
I don't live in the USA since I'm not an
[SPEAKER_01]: American You know that it stands in
British law that they can only extradite
[SPEAKER_01]: you to another country if you've broken a
similar law in your own country,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know if it's it's within law that You
are operating illegally in some way or
[SPEAKER_01]: another Which I wasn't yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, I was just kind of living in
the Philippines semi-retired and You know
[SPEAKER_01]: my breeding project then was was making
more kids and just having a family life
[SPEAKER_01]: and I had a still Got a few hectares down
on the Sulu Sea there Full of coconut
[SPEAKER_01]: trees and just trying to live a more basic
life away from the mega Sydney madness of
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of the world But then the rest of
the world has the long arms of the law
[SPEAKER_01]: that can reach around And grab hold of you
and screw your life up for the next five
[SPEAKER_01]: or six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they did Had a lot of loss of
family life I Missed my kids for many
[SPEAKER_01]: years Although they could come visit me
when I was in jail, but then I left the
[SPEAKER_01]: Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally They allowed me to come back to
the UK and I think Going back there and
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about other people within the
cannabis industry I was locked up for
[SPEAKER_01]: about two years in that jail and then the
British Embassy came to see me The
[SPEAKER_01]: consular attache and he came along with
this quite portly man who was who had
[SPEAKER_01]: flown in from Bangkok who was part of the
consular cache a group over in Bangkok and
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing he said to me is you know,
Howard Marks, don't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so And he winked at me, you know,
did you know how of marks and I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, well, that's what's that got to do
with things and after that guy left Over
[SPEAKER_01]: the next six months the British Embassy
couldn't do more to help me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually got this one guy on my case
He was half Filipino half English this
[SPEAKER_01]: young young fella to push my case forward
and so that I could finally Go back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: UK and to do that I had to drop two cases
in the Supreme Court I had against the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bureau of Immigration over there because I
brought cases against them and They said
[SPEAKER_01]: that they won't they're not going to let
me leave the Philippines unless I drop
[SPEAKER_01]: these cases In the Supreme Court,
so that took about six months to do Before
[SPEAKER_01]: finally they dropped the cases and then
they allowed me to deport Because I had a
[SPEAKER_01]: good case against them, but I would have
been there for Forever waiting for it to
[SPEAKER_01]: come up in the Supreme Court.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the point?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still on a blacklist so I can't go
back there unless I clear it with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Philippine Embassy here in London and with
the would they want me back and if I go
[SPEAKER_01]: back They think I'm some sort of cannabis
kingpin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is what was said the the
Filipino DEA Consider me to be some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of kingpin Well, I mean you got to admit
if you know how it marks not hard for them
[SPEAKER_00]: to confuse that while we're on the topic
Did you have any cool or interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: stories of spending time with Howard at
all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think I met Howard the first time was I
was very young.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was out out in Asia long long back in
the 80s But then he became quite Visible
[SPEAKER_01]: on on the whole weed scene with Mr. Nice
stuff that came out and the association
[SPEAKER_01]: with Ben drunkers and Of course Shanti
Baba or Scott Yes, I've known all those
[SPEAKER_01]: guys on and off For quite a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all kind of revolve in a similar
circles on the internet within the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry or did and Occasionally we get
together and party On the rare occasion
[SPEAKER_01]: that we did it was because I can't
remember Half of it because it was so
[SPEAKER_01]: intense That was the way it was It was sad
because I think Howard went the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally made it back to the UK and I was
not in good shape That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the last couple of a year a year
and a half I've really been concentrating
[SPEAKER_01]: on my own health and get back in shape
because you know sitting in a prison in
[SPEAKER_01]: Bangkok for getting on for three years
isn't Doing your body much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even tried to work out and slipped in
the cat shit and injured myself That kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of turned me off Yeah Occasionally I Might
have a chat with one or two and I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be more interesting to just go
and interview them So that's what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing putting together some sort of
travelogue
[SPEAKER_01]: Video Podcast chat thing or whatever you
want to call it going to interview these
[SPEAKER_01]: different breeders in different parts of
the world It seems like I might be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: more of that Coming along and I haven't
done this type of work in 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did put out a couple of DVDs I think it
was back in 2003 2004 one was about the
[SPEAKER_01]: kif from the rift Which was about the hash
trade in Morocco and another one was with
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble man over in Jamaica making bubble
hash That must be nearly 20 years ago so
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, it's it's kind of an old profession
that I'm trying to pick up again and and
[SPEAKER_01]: See if I can be an interesting interviewer
basically doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that might be Interesting for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always admired Certain people Who do
that as a job and I thought that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: a really really cool job to be able to do
should be able to travel and experience
[SPEAKER_01]: various cultures meet different people and
Just keep talking about stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: interests people, you know The the viewers
is in trance by what you're saying isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: bored to tears Now try to make it
interesting That's fantastic you you fully
[SPEAKER_00]: answer one of the questions I was gonna
ask you which I was gonna say can we
[SPEAKER_00]: expect any more of those videos?
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's great to hear and you mentioned
bubble man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to quickly ask you I feel like
there's been a notable decline in the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of people who are interested in
bubble Especially in the advent of like bh
[SPEAKER_00]: o and all these other types of
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you think we can help?
[SPEAKER_00]: Educate people that like really high
quality bubble is still some of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: quality Concentrate you can get I Don't
know and you've got to kind of look at
[SPEAKER_01]: this not as a cannabis connoisseur you got
to pull back and kind of look at it as the
[SPEAKER_01]: general public and Then make a comparison.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean a lot of people do always to the
alcohol industry and So if you could try
[SPEAKER_01]: to compare say bubble to the alcohol
industry What sort of booze would you have
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd have very fine expensive single malt
or something like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And out of all the people that alcohol How
many of them actually are really into
[SPEAKER_01]: super expensive fine single malts?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a very small percentage So
yeah, there's it's interesting bubble,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know for me has always been something
nice but on an everyday basis I Fear that
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just be knocked out I Stick to my
kind of mild Moroccan hat And it keeps me
[SPEAKER_00]: going That's brilliant we've had other
guests in the past talk about Many years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, you know say the 90s when
concentrates weren't as widely distributed
[SPEAKER_00]: as they are now People talk fondly about
smoking with Sam the skunk man and he
[SPEAKER_00]: would have like, you know Some of the only
full melt bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever get access to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any recollections of events
like that some memorable hash smoking with
[SPEAKER_00]: people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sam's always been that way You know when
you when you see him or your first meeting
[SPEAKER_01]: you see him on a regular basis He'll
always have Usually has this very fine dry
[SPEAKER_01]: siff that he makes himself He's very
particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: He won't take anything from anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen him smoking anybody else's
gear and He uses that he was the first guy
[SPEAKER_01]: that I came across.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many years ago it was
That told me about CBD He said now smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: this and you're not gonna get high off it,
but you might feel a bit better It's an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting concept, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like non-alcohol beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is stuff is like non-alcohol beer
salmon No, no, no, it's it's just CBDs in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not He's got all these numbers and
names for all these different terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: God knows what you know Just blinds me
with science sometimes the guy is so
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledgeable But yeah, he knows what he's
talking about and sure enough Another ten
[SPEAKER_01]: years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all over the place people It's it's
it's a panacea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a therapeutic thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in all sorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even in shampoo, you know That's
brilliant to hear I mean while we're on
[SPEAKER_00]: the topic of Sam who was some of the first
People once you you know, you started IC
[SPEAKER_00]: mag you thought let's get the seeds out
there Who were the first breeders whose
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds you were distributing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it like Sam's stuff or was it other
people?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the first associations I
had was with Mal from Nirvana seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we share a name It was kind of
interesting I like the guy he's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not He's very different to say Hank
from Dutch passion or Or Ben drunkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the guy from the streets Interesting
guy was mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I made an association with now
first and started Vending the first
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took on whether it was him with his
seats That must have been I don't know And
[SPEAKER_01]: late 90s I think from Hollywood Yeah,
the first time I started doing it and I
[SPEAKER_01]: put a website up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was called seeds direct dot to
based in Tonga Yeah, and then I had a one
[SPEAKER_01]: page ad in high times and It started
snowing through the mailbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many people were ordering It
was hard to keep up with the orders just
[SPEAKER_01]: off the off the get-go As it turns out
that I was one of the only People in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean there was a couple of other Seed
distributors online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Mark Emory was doing it in Canada
and Heavens Stairway in Canada also a
[SPEAKER_01]: place called Laughing Moon Yeah,
that was about it so I've kind of tapped
[SPEAKER_01]: into a niche market of cannabis seeds That
people were really trying to get hold of
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all these new varieties that
were coming out and older ones that They
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't get locally and they could only
get internationally So yeah started
[SPEAKER_01]: snowing orders and trying to keep the
administration together and the work the
[SPEAKER_01]: workers You know to micromanage all that
stuff it's quite an Accomplishment for me
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to get hold of you know,
it took a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Don't know maybe it's gonna take forever
But I find it much easier without having
[SPEAKER_01]: employees these days Just minima minima
minimalizing my life Making things smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of bigger Taking less on instead
of more on being a moron That sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: a good approach given the you know,
how busy you've been in the past What was
[SPEAKER_00]: it like as the business grew, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you remember were you just picking up a
lot of sort of European Dutch breeders and
[SPEAKER_00]: and if if so Do you remember when America
first sort of came on the map in your mind
[SPEAKER_00]: is like hey I could I could get a lot of
USA breeders to and who were the first
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well I I looked at it from a global
perspective because I know that this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: grows just about everywhere, you know Or
it can do it has the potential to If you
[SPEAKER_01]: give it the right environment,
of course and people were creating
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful indoor grow environments
tropical or otherwise I mean I I live
[SPEAKER_01]: about Think about seven eight miles away
from Kew Gardens I could just go there and
[SPEAKER_01]: walk around the tropical house and Imagine
it was full of cannabis, you know So I
[SPEAKER_01]: know that you can create environments like
that and my grow history I kind of a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: rubbed off from my grandfather who is one
of the top guys in the Royal Horticultural
[SPEAKER_01]: Society and he used to grow wonderful
chrysanthemums and breed them and win all
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts of trophies and medals and plaques
for it You see the silver on his
[SPEAKER_01]: mantelpiece.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all from chrysanthemums Yeah,
I live in an area Where there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens and there's a lot of stuff
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very green area of London right near
Bushy Park and Richmond Park so it always
[SPEAKER_01]: is a child I was always interested in
plants and now they grow and Then it led
[SPEAKER_01]: to me being thrown in jail and me wanting
to get back at it and So I thought I'd be
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed distributor and it was a fun job too,
you know and running around the world
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for rare land race varieties So
anything somebody was making in a
[SPEAKER_01]: different neck of the woods?
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, you don't you try and have a
look at how this person was making seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not they were a closet breeder
or Whether or not they were doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: properly So I have fun traveling all over
the world to go and visit these people
[SPEAKER_01]: often before I go I bought their seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see how they actually made them
God knows they might just buy them from
[SPEAKER_01]: someone else and sell them to you It might
just be a middleman I got interested then
[SPEAKER_01]: in all the different varieties and seeing
how people would grow them in different
[SPEAKER_01]: environments and Being able to share this
knowledge because these people obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: they're living in a very secure
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have many associates with other
people because they're doing something
[SPEAKER_01]: that needs to be kept secret so a lot of
them their only outlet has been through
[SPEAKER_01]: the internet and Being able to communicate
with other like-minded people anonymously
[SPEAKER_01]: is Important for that and they've been
able to do that Now for how many years
[SPEAKER_01]: have we had IC mag going?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think not 18 19 years something like I
think going since 2003 2004 So they're
[SPEAKER_01]: able to do that through the site and it's
a good way for people to mingle Make
[SPEAKER_01]: friends it's a lot of people a lot of
friends have been made through the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet and A lot of those people would
never have met each other in real life and
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps never will but they still got a
friend online Yeah, that's a brilliant
[SPEAKER_00]: point you make and I guess I would be
interested to know was there ever a point
[SPEAKER_00]: where you realized how big IC mag was
getting and the influence it was having
[SPEAKER_00]: like when you're going around checking
these different breeders could you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: that this was getting a lot of momentum or
was it still just sort of relatively
[SPEAKER_01]: seeming like it was controlled I Don't
really know I could say I'm not Educated
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly that far academically or You
know, I haven't been through a college or
[SPEAKER_01]: a university so maybe that's my excuse to
say that Yeah, I saw things moving forward
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just wanted to do what I always did
which was travel and meet new breeders and
[SPEAKER_01]: growers and either get new seeds made or
Buy seeds that were already made By these
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders and then bring them back and then
the whole distribution Outfit would take
[SPEAKER_01]: care of the distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have to do all the emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Wouldn't have to do all the work setting
up websites anything like that I just go
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world and meet people buy seeds
trade seeds grow plants, whatever it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I was interested in and so I
was reliable upon You know a core of
[SPEAKER_01]: people back in the UK to keep the whole
distribution up and of course when I get
[SPEAKER_01]: into trouble Like I did in 2013 and the
people that were working for me and with
[SPEAKER_01]: me Got the heebie-jeebies naturally
because they'll think it's like dominoes
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna be next So obviously Work kind
of slacks off or you're not there to
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're stuck in some stinking jail and in
40 degrees Celsius under a tin roof in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Philippines so You're not functioning the
best that you can either and With your
[SPEAKER_00]: brain While we're on that topic Do you
think that when you read people online who
[SPEAKER_00]: may be?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know have some gripe with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe with some seeds they bought or
whatever Do you think that like that
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially was the circumstances in which
that happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe it happened while you're in
jail and like it was out of your control
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of thing Or what's your thoughts on
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean the whole mail-order seed
industry is it's it's full of pitfalls and
[SPEAKER_01]: difficulties many levels from the buyers
perspective and also from the sellers
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective because you know for years I
went through working within that industry
[SPEAKER_01]: and You know with with the whale way that
the mail is having PO boxes that certain
[SPEAKER_01]: postmen figure out There's there's money
going to those boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so orders disappear You send orders out
and they come back to you six months later
[SPEAKER_01]: after you've recent the order twice,
you know, it's it's a crazy world that
[SPEAKER_01]: whole mail-order world and Nothing is
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing works You know like clockwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Yeah, we had all sorts of problems
and then of course you got staffing
[SPEAKER_01]: problems because you're in a cannabis
industry most of the people working with
[SPEAKER_01]: you are stoned anyway and Occasionally
people make big mistakes because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: stoned or they forget things I mean I've
done it myself before so it's not very
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate sometimes Because of the nature
of business I guess you could put it that
[SPEAKER_00]: way Yeah, certainly I guess just to you
know, put it to rest to anyone out there
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever has had any issues, you know sort
of accusing of like any sort of issues
[SPEAKER_00]: with seeds or like replacing seeds or
anything Are you saying there's absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: no truth to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just that the general
inherent issues of the seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other seed companies that will try
and build themselves up by putting you
[SPEAKER_01]: down you get fake customers sometimes who
demand that they ordered and yet they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't or that they Didn't receive their
order and yet they did you should have
[SPEAKER_01]: seen back in the heyday of it some of the
charge backs We used to get were
[SPEAKER_01]: horrendous, you know looking at five grand
a month or something people that receive
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds or whatever it is that you're
sending them and Didn't say that they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't because you don't end up with a
signature as you're sending it through
[SPEAKER_01]: regular post and There's no actual proof
that the person received it when perhaps
[SPEAKER_01]: they did or perhaps they didn't you you
never know This is the whole thing With an
[SPEAKER_01]: international post it's so unpredictable
It can work nine times out of ten or it
[SPEAKER_01]: can only work one time out of ten It
depends where you live and what happens on
[SPEAKER_00]: the way Yeah, certainly certainly so I
mean if we loop back to what we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about before you're going around to
different breeders houses sort of trading
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds getting a feel for the land with is
there anyone's grow or bud who like it
[SPEAKER_00]: really stood out in your mind is like
memorable where you were just really blown
[SPEAKER_01]: away Yeah, there's a lot of different
breeders a lot of different characters and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's difficult to You know to put them in
the list who you thinks better or worse
[SPEAKER_01]: but Who stands out I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Guess breeders Steve more than anything a
Canadian Breeder you had a company called
[SPEAKER_01]: spice of life seeds very interesting guy
very smart and Yeah, I used to go I used
[SPEAKER_01]: to drive to Switzerland he he got himself
set up with a Factory in Switzerland for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while and I used to drive out there and
see what he was growing you know he was
[SPEAKER_01]: really into making this variety called
sweet tooth and Several others a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: them were Canada based varieties or USA
based varieties that he he come into
[SPEAKER_01]: contact with and made seeds from But yeah,
that was one of the more interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders I'd say We'd be breeder Steve and
of course Sam skunk man as well you could
[SPEAKER_01]: sit there and could ramble on for hours
Just interesting stuff if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: understand it Because it's quite technical
a lot of the time Yeah, if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at people like him Somebody that's
been eclipsed by this plant all of their
[SPEAKER_01]: life and had something to do with it in
One form or another has made it living out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, so it's part of the industry Yeah,
definitely definitely I mean I was also
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna say we're lucky enough to have had
breeder Steve on the show he's definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: a Very smart guy interesting character,
and I remember I think he actually told a
[SPEAKER_00]: story about being on an autobahn with You
in a fancy car or something going very
[SPEAKER_01]: fast Yeah, yeah, we have some funny
experiences sometimes Yeah, I used to have
[SPEAKER_01]: this very fast car needs to drive it over
to Switzerland and commute to Amsterdam in
[SPEAKER_01]: it And there was quite a few adventures
associated with its travels Suitcases full
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds Getting pulled over by the Who
was it by the Belgian police?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just before I went into France from
Belgium and Then then finding a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: Samsonite suitcases for the seeds that I
just bought in Amsterdam because I used to
[SPEAKER_01]: go on a a couple of times a month I'd go
through all the breeders in Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_01]: just buy a whole bunch of seeds and then
drive them back to the UK Rather than risk
[SPEAKER_01]: sending them through the post And of
course I'd have to travel through Belgium
[SPEAKER_01]: and France to get to the channel port to
get to Calais before I could take the
[SPEAKER_01]: channel tunnel over to the UK and Yeah,
they nabbed me once in Belgium and in the
[SPEAKER_01]: diff it ended up with them taking all the
seeds that I had in the back of the car
[SPEAKER_01]: They detained me for I think about four
hours and just let me go After searching
[SPEAKER_01]: the car Quite well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were looking for class-a
drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were surprised to find seeds And the
funny thing was as I drove away I'd before
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd stashed half a spliff in the
sunglasses Capsule just above your head if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're driving that car And I popped that
down and they hadn't even looked in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had half a spliff as driving away
from the Belgian police had just taken I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know about 50 Grands worth of seeds
off me And there's me smoking a spliff
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking I'm lucky to get away with that
And I said to them when they took the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds away what I do they said I'll get an
attorney I'm thinking geez that attorney
[SPEAKER_01]: is gonna cost more than the seeds did
That's brilliant, you know, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: there's all these pitfalls I mean if
you're if you're a businessman And you're
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to distribute camp cannabis
seeds around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot more difficult than than if
you're into doing distributing shoes or
[SPEAKER_01]: plates There's a lot more pitfalls
Particularly legally just driving through
[SPEAKER_01]: a country with something that's legal in
the country You bought it from in the
[SPEAKER_01]: country you're going to that's what
happened Yeah, look, that's interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: sounds sounds stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you find it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stressful or is all pretty laid-back Now
I'm quite used to You know the customs
[SPEAKER_01]: organizations around the world and the
thought of being detained and all that So
[SPEAKER_01]: you kind of preempt these things you might
do a trip ten or twenty times and think
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, yeah That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know in the back of your mind That
there is a potential that you could come
[SPEAKER_01]: unstuck but you kind of you work that into
the risk factor And you either take the
[SPEAKER_01]: chance or you don't And if it happens at
least you prepared yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: psychologically for the event So you're
kind of like, oh, yeah, I thought about
[SPEAKER_01]: this before this this was gonna happen
sooner or later So you can kind of eat
[SPEAKER_01]: that And not get too freaked out about it
as if it's a big surprise Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: so so so so I'm Always interested to know
I got I have this like theory in life
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like any job you can think of
Like some of the biggest challenges like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not the things you would think about
it's other stuff So I want to know when
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were doing the seed boutique and
I see mag was sort of at its peak What
[SPEAKER_00]: were some of the challenges that like the
general public was probably not even aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of that you were dealing with and you're
like, you know It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's causing you frustration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like if people knew it would be
like make my life so much easier Like what
[SPEAKER_00]: made the job challenging?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Think it's drama You know if you let too
much drama into your life if the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that You're in regular contact with daily
have ulterior motives if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretending to be something they're not and
you were actually fooled by it and you've
[SPEAKER_01]: taken people into your confidence,
perhaps you shouldn't have and Then it can
[SPEAKER_01]: all fall apart Quite quickly if you don't
feel that you have the security within
[SPEAKER_01]: your own business that you thought you did
have before And this happened Because it
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not only the business but the people
that run it they have their own personal
[SPEAKER_01]: relationships, of course and Their
interactions with other people and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the success of the business is to a
greater degree I think based upon Them
[SPEAKER_01]: being in harmony than anything else
Because if you don't have the chemistry of
[SPEAKER_01]: the people that work for the business
Correct, then the business isn't going to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it'll pull itself apart and this
started to happen because I broke up with
[SPEAKER_01]: my partner Nikki and we had a partnership
in the business and both of us equal
[SPEAKER_01]: partnership and then the manager that I
had at the time this Roger Thomas Clark
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise known as plural of mongoose and
was kind of the manager of the mail order
[SPEAKER_01]: and they Became an item they became a
couple and they moved in to a house with
[SPEAKER_01]: each other and then they tried to Take the
business off me to skirt scare all the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that were involved all the other
employees With me with threats veiled
[SPEAKER_01]: threats and otherwise And it became nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's if you know this business That I
created with Nikki as help, of course
[SPEAKER_01]: Suddenly it wasn't the beautiful business
that I thought it was that somebody else
[SPEAKER_01]: to becoming bold and it turned kind of
nasty and We had the certain events
[SPEAKER_01]: violence certain events of Extreme
emotional distress amongst the people
[SPEAKER_01]: involved and Yeah It was like a It turned
into a bit of a beast I Didn't enjoy it so
[SPEAKER_00]: much Is this the the context around that
infamous video of I'll eat your mind Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: well that was Kind of made as a gag I
think if you see in the beginning of it Or
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end I'm saying cut Because I asked
the guy to film it and told them that
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I'm gonna chastise Teflon in front
of the camera because he was in cahoots
[SPEAKER_01]: with the mongoose and To film it because
it might be interesting people might want
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at it So it was kind of I had my
mindset in the long good Friday that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some movie Some scene in a movie
and I was very stoned at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's give a Teflon some grief But
not to the point of chucking him out the
[SPEAKER_01]: window.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never had that intention It was just
kind of a bit of drama that we played out
[SPEAKER_01]: That was all that was And then mongoose
mongoose got hold of it and then used it
[SPEAKER_01]: Thought he he was using it as something
really bad to throw at me and put online
[SPEAKER_01]: So and you entertained a bunch more other
people I suppose Yeah, interesting we had
[SPEAKER_00]: a few listeners who asked about sort of
just your general Reflections on having
[SPEAKER_00]: work with mongoose I guess by sort of what
you've said here you sort of like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know Would you say you regret it or it's
just one of those things where you like
[SPEAKER_00]: learn to lessen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you've got to look at yourself
in the mirror and say that you've been
[SPEAKER_01]: naive you know that You've let people into
your life that haven't been beneficial to
[SPEAKER_01]: it You know haven't even been neutral that
have been bad Your association with those
[SPEAKER_01]: people It's not ended up well put it that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you can have regrets What's the
point?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the past now As far as whatever
mongoose has done I think now he's He's
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in a I don't know is it a nursing
home or or a jail in New York still
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting on his sentencing and He plea
bargain down to I think just being charged
[SPEAKER_01]: with one case And he's he's looking at 240
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is In jail that will be minus
whatever he's served Well Reading through
[SPEAKER_01]: the papers because as a trial goes on or a
case goes on in the USA, you can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: follow it And one of my ex employees has
been following the case of the mongoose at
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment and of course, he's accused of
being instrumentally involved with the
[SPEAKER_01]: Silk Road website that would sell Every
type of drug imaginable There was a few
[SPEAKER_01]: kids that ordered with their mums credit
cards and died of heroin overdoses or
[SPEAKER_01]: something through that website So he was
involved with something That I would never
[SPEAKER_01]: touch And now it's you know, he's trying I
think he's trying to delay his sentence in
[SPEAKER_01]: as much as he can because He's had a fall
from his bunk in jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's complaining constantly about not
having a pen and other things and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been reading through the case lately
what's going on with him and They're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get him sentenced
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody in the prison system now I have a
kind of a little feeling for because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: no fun Maybe it's something to do with
karma with him Because I see I see him do
[SPEAKER_01]: so many other people wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's coming back on him now We'll
find out I think he's sentenced Supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to be some some time around the end of
September Coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to follow that one to see what
happens I think at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you've been talking about
negative associations Everyone is waiting
[SPEAKER_00]: to hear us talk about res, you know He's a
focal and polarizing figure in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community and especially in
history What was your relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: him like and reflecting back on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you view it now?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess you know whether you want to
answer now or later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would go into the the whole incident
with Dutch grown and whatnot Yeah res well
[SPEAKER_01]: As you read through you spend hours
looking at a forum site and you read
[SPEAKER_01]: through it Some members stick out more
than others for whatever reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they use language that Is outrageous
or maybe they've got some sort of humor
[SPEAKER_01]: That you can you can jive with res always
seem kind of interesting to me and He had
[SPEAKER_01]: a kind of a following of people that
either they loved him or they hated him
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you had this he got a reaction out of
people I think because it was always very
[SPEAKER_01]: abusive to everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that was it
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it was he has some sort of
pizzazz, you know and He seemed to know a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit about breeding and he was making seeds
eventually and he wanted an outlet for
[SPEAKER_01]: them So I suggested hey, you know,
I've got an outlet why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like any other breeders, I started
vending seeds that came from him over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years and Generally, they were quite
popular, you know, he had his detractors
[SPEAKER_01]: and he would voice Cyphers Lee attack them
too on the boards of overgrow or IC make
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I think I had to ban him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even had to ban res at one point for a
short period of time Yeah, he seemed like
[SPEAKER_01]: before I even met him he seemed quite a an
open and interesting character Or maybe it
[SPEAKER_01]: was just a persona he'd created for use on
the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't to know until I met him,
of course And what was that like When I
[SPEAKER_01]: did meet him it's a very slender Kind of
haggard looking dude like he'd he'd worn
[SPEAKER_01]: life on his face a few times and Yeah,
he He was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was conversationally Quite lucid and we
talked a lot about different things and
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years build up a relationship as
a vendor and him the producer of various
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and we he would allow him to go and
build up his release or whatever it was
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we do a pre-release on seed bay
and Get some seeds out there people would
[SPEAKER_01]: grow them and then if they turned out well
Then others would want to buy more We had
[SPEAKER_01]: this ongoing Kind of business deal with
him he would it was very difficult to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: him, you know, so you could only pay him
in cash and You know, you couldn't just
[SPEAKER_01]: send it like we with the other breeders or
whatever It was most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just pay them bank to bank or
whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want to pay the trail Yeah,
and I think One time he was on his way
[SPEAKER_01]: back and he got caught with some cash or
some seeds got caught He was sending
[SPEAKER_01]: coming this way and the cops roped him in
Little did I know about it at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: That he he'd already had I think two
strikes he lived down in Florida and he'd
[SPEAKER_01]: had a some sort of cocaine charge some
it's some federal charge against him and
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it was back in the times I think
when it's like three three strikes and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So If he got busted for something else
then they could throw him away for for a
[SPEAKER_01]: very long time in jail Now this is what I
think led to him turning in Foreman and
[SPEAKER_01]: Grossing up a lot of people over there
like chem dog and Dutch grown and a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of other people That the police pulled in
and squeezed them as they do And so it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes and I was one of the ones that got
turned over For better or for worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they probably I heard that they'd
gone to After they took res down and then
[SPEAKER_01]: turned him into an informant He told him
about Dutch grown and they'd gone over
[SPEAKER_01]: there and they'd seen My name on seed
packets what I wanted to know who's this
[SPEAKER_01]: gypsy naban and of course, they'd handed
me over as a their UK distributor and At
[SPEAKER_01]: that time I was out in the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was living there I was resident and So
that's where they think I was not as if I
[SPEAKER_01]: was hiding I was being quite open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think I had anything to worry
about really but Obviously I I did And it
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up with me being detained Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the burps No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You strike me as someone who's sort of I
get the vibe you sort of made your peace
[SPEAKER_00]: with it all Do you still hold him quite
personally accountable for it all and as a
[SPEAKER_00]: follow-up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like do you have any thoughts on the fact
he's like back and active on Instagram?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know I could be bitter and I
could feed off some sort of hate and Want
[SPEAKER_01]: to You know get some sort of revenge or
whatever it is, but I can't muster up the
[SPEAKER_01]: energy to bother it just seems like Not a
very productive endeavor to go after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really into tearing people down if
he's come through it all and can manage to
[SPEAKER_01]: Eco living our life I think he's got more
to worry about the people he grassed up in
[SPEAKER_01]: the States than me I'm a long way away You
know, we all have to pay for our sins at
[SPEAKER_01]: some point I guess and You know,
I always like rest always thought it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of a crazy guy It was always popping
pills to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always in these pharmaceuticals,
whatever it was but He visited me a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of times when I was in the Philippines You
know, I got along fairly well with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't have You know, I didn't hate
the guy or I don't really get into hate
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway, so and Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm gonna say that this guy has to
go to jail and do 20 30 years for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Mean who's gonna do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, you're gonna go to jail for me
They came after me anyway and in the diff
[SPEAKER_01]: they couldn't get me And I've got a clear
clean slate now They've dropped the
[SPEAKER_01]: charges in the court in Maine and I've got
the proof the original Court documents
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that there's no charge against me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been dropped But it really screwed my
life up for a long time cost me an arm and
[SPEAKER_01]: a leg They're led to a more simple life,
which which I'm quite enjoying to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: the truth That's interesting to hear it's
coming Full circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that did out of curiosity a lot of
people say that um Rez did a lot of his
[SPEAKER_00]: work out of a few tents, which people try
to criticize But I always thought isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: that more like impressive because he is
regarded as having some pretty pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: bloody good work Have you heard anything
about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see anything like that when you
were with him?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, actually I never saw anything where's
it ever grown because I never really
[SPEAKER_01]: visited New York Much at all since the
1980s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in New York in the 80s, but no I I
never went to see any of his grades,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I did need know some people did and
they said they weren't really a large
[SPEAKER_01]: concern to say the least But yeah,
it's like with breeders again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some are very few of them hardly
any of them Do it what's considered the
[SPEAKER_01]: right way by growing out for selection?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tens of thousands of plants or at least a
thousand they can know they only can do it
[SPEAKER_01]: within the space that they have So if
they've got a closet they could still make
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds Like you can still make children in
a council house and you can make them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: mansion, you know Yeah fair point fair
point Interestingly, you were one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first people to pick up bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your friendship with bog like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now bog was always entertaining wasn't he
in a kind of risque Bordy Bordered on
[SPEAKER_01]: kinky way the way he would describe how he
would play with his female plants or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever I Just like this is this broad
sense of humor because I know that humor
[SPEAKER_01]: is a good way to teach people If once
people are laughing, they're more likely
[SPEAKER_01]: to hang on every word you say so bog had
the Kind of skill to write down stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: would make you laugh and wince and cringe
or whatever it was It was an interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: character just in the way he wrote So I
got after in that way and then of course I
[SPEAKER_01]: said to him at one point I used to send
him free seeds because he would always
[SPEAKER_01]: grow them out Make some glowing report
sometimes and I said why don't you make
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds from the seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: I send you so he decided to become a
breeder and that's how he started bog
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and The rest is history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he's not with us anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he died Last year or the year
before no not too long ago, and I hope
[SPEAKER_01]: he's resting in peace He's got plenty of
bog bubble with him Certainly actually he
[SPEAKER_01]: came out to Amsterdam a couple of times as
well and he used to be a paramedic and so
[SPEAKER_01]: he'd have quite quite a bit of life
experience I'd say anybody who works in
[SPEAKER_01]: that profession would do and And he did
some things with me like we drove through
[SPEAKER_01]: the German autobahns at speeds in a fast
Jaguar and I let him drive and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: drove We went over the mountains and yeah,
it was kind of idyllic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a good laugh together Good
character sounds brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it's about personalities
and characters.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's what I enjoy most You know
getting around to meet these people and of
[SPEAKER_01]: course the the lovely plants that they're
involved with generally as well that's an
[SPEAKER_01]: interest to but They've been able to
travel and meet people Why not you can
[SPEAKER_01]: always stay at home and grow but that's
the options you have Generally I choose to
[SPEAKER_01]: be on the road But if you're raising your
own kids at home with your missus You
[SPEAKER_01]: don't to be absent too often So this stage
in my life, I'm spending more time around
[SPEAKER_00]: the house, I suppose Yeah, certainly and
yeah, I didn't mention before,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know rest in peace bog another
Character who we have to give a rest in
[SPEAKER_00]: peace to who you have a history with sub
cool who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Passed about a year before bog did what
was your relationship with sub cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mean, there's obviously that
notable story him on the forums When you
[SPEAKER_00]: got arrested, how do you reflect on the
relationship you guys had?
[SPEAKER_01]: sub cool is another guy that and was out
of the early overgrown days I think he was
[SPEAKER_01]: in weed base even before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that variety?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was connected with Jack's cleaner.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it he was all into the Jack's
cleaner thing and I got to know him a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: online and then I think at one point he
put into quite a bit of trouble and I said
[SPEAKER_01]: To him well, why don't you come over to
Europe?
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe if it works out if you're
the right person for it, I can give you
[SPEAKER_01]: some work and I'll let you stay in a place
there when you come over so he did
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually came over and at that time it
was around about it was the first cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cup that I had a stall in and I was
advertising the stash boxes and also seed
[SPEAKER_01]: company and I kind of got him to help out
with that trying to set it up and After
[SPEAKER_01]: he'd been over for a short while and he
brought another friend of his over Blunt
[SPEAKER_01]: blunt, I think his name was I don't know
his his real name that he called him blunt
[SPEAKER_01]: and He also asked if he could stay at this
place I was renting this house at 43
[SPEAKER_01]: Zaydyke It used to be owned by Morris de
Hoend who is a famous hash smuggler and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a crazy place with a lot of different
bedrooms and different levels and what
[SPEAKER_01]: have you and at that time I was given
because I was writing for weed world
[SPEAKER_01]: magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave me this big plastic bucket full
of various types of hash and weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's 30 odd types of weed and
maybe the same again different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: hash and so calling blunt sat down with me
and we were trying to judge So I was
[SPEAKER_01]: giving them a smoke of one variety and
something else And these guys were always
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about harder drugs as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were always talking about
Pharmaceuticals I forget the names of that
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty strong opiates or Synthetic opiates
that they were into Like Percocets or
[SPEAKER_00]: something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Is it Vicodan?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Vicodan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a strong one Vicodan and some
others I can't recollect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing I've really been into
Those sort of things of serious pain
[SPEAKER_01]: relief and these guys just didn't look
like they were in serious pain Anyway
[SPEAKER_01]: suffice to say that after I think a few
varieties I tried and I just it's knocking
[SPEAKER_01]: me out so I had to go to bed and I woke up
the next morning and Sucko was running
[SPEAKER_01]: around saying his friend had died during
the night and I'm like what the hell is
[SPEAKER_01]: going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: So sure enough This blunt guy had passed
on in the night for whatever reason I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean, I'm not sure but you know,
I could I could have my guesses So this
[SPEAKER_00]: was the the notable incident with Danny
Boy Danny that was his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Danny Boy Blunt he used to call
maybe that was his own name online name
[SPEAKER_01]: was blunt In the house at the time we were
stopped from my company in the UK It's
[SPEAKER_01]: about three different ladies and they're
all freaking out It's not every day you
[SPEAKER_01]: wake up And there's a dead guy in the
house And you don't even know the guy You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I don't know if you've seen some of
them movies Where what's the name of that
[SPEAKER_01]: movie?
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw once where they had a party and then
they woke up the next morning and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a dead guy in the house it's just like
that and it kind of freaked everybody out
[SPEAKER_01]: knocked him off whack a bit and Sucko was
just really losing it and I was trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: help him out and calm him down and
realized that he was agitating the women
[SPEAKER_01]: as well The ladies there who were very
emotionally upset So I thought Best if if
[SPEAKER_01]: we get him a hotel, so okay, so I called
400 bucks and said they go get a hotel
[SPEAKER_01]: because we can't deal with this right now,
you know, we're busy as a company trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to do this cannabis cup thing and This
emotionally is upset in the whole house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's better if you if you get a hotel
and He was you know, I'm not there as a
[SPEAKER_01]: psychologist because he's Buddy died,
you know for me it was it was I was trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to deal with a the whole business thing is
keeping the stall open Cannabis cup and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing what we intended to do while we were
over there from England Yeah, it was it
[SPEAKER_01]: was difficult let's put it that way maybe
I was a bit brash Maybe he was a bit too
[SPEAKER_01]: emotive about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long he'd known the guy
but it was as if he'd lost a brother It
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't good Yeah, I think you know
reflecting back on the chat I had with sub
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he did largely view Danny as a
brother That's interesting to hear your
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective Yeah, because I think when he
said it he sort of viewed it as being
[SPEAKER_00]: kicked out of the house But of course,
you know, we didn't really know about the
[SPEAKER_00]: effect he was having on the other
housemates, which is obviously a
[SPEAKER_01]: consideration Yeah, so to me morale was
important and we were trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something there that we worked out months
before and To get it done, you know We
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't be mourning this guy and be
walking around moping because this guy had
[SPEAKER_01]: died in the house So he didn't even know
the guy anyway So it was kind of removed
[SPEAKER_01]: was sad But it was kind of removed for the
fact that this guy was nothing to any of
[SPEAKER_01]: us It was just somebody that showed up the
day before literally Some of the girls
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't even know that he was in the house
in the first place Certainly a very
[SPEAKER_00]: unforeseen event for sure How did and then
how did that all pan out after that the
[SPEAKER_00]: event finished and you just ended up going
home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any like follow-up
investigation or they just accepted it as
[SPEAKER_00]: an accident?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there was me also a bit concerned
because I had this huge cache of samples
[SPEAKER_01]: for the cannabis cup inside The house and
I don't know what the other people there
[SPEAKER_01]: were what type of recreational drugs they
might have had For their own use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there was quite a compliment of
people in the house itself so Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a concern for that, but it
turned out that there was no investigation
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything like that And they said that
he had some sort of heart attack Something
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with his heart And that was all I
ever heard about it And then well,
[SPEAKER_01]: the next thing I knew is sub call a bad
male Me saying that I acted in a bad way
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know That's basically telling some
lies as well Maybe he felt hard done by by
[SPEAKER_01]: my reaction to the whole thing It's sad,
but that's the way it is sometimes Shit
[SPEAKER_01]: happens and maybe you don't act the
coolest on the block with it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: look certainly sounds like a very complex
Situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine that there would have been a lot
of competing interests at mind I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, obviously a rest in peace Danny
boy and sub and bog While we're on that
[SPEAKER_00]: topic, you know I guess around that time
was sort of around the time when we had
[SPEAKER_00]: the original incarnation of Brothers Grimm
and I feel like you don't really hear much
[SPEAKER_00]: about sly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr Soul's still around and doing his thing
But do you have any recollections about
[SPEAKER_00]: slide or did you ever deal with the
Brothers Grimm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was I think I was this the second
vendor ever to offer their seats for sale
[SPEAKER_01]: after Heaven stairway at Richard
Calrissian He was their initial vendor and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they wanted somebody in Europe So I
think it must have been 2001 or something
[SPEAKER_01]: 21 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I became a vendor of Brothers Grimm seats
and they were very Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, they're very interesting to a lot
of Dutch breeders Who taken them since
[SPEAKER_01]: then may made their own varieties or
crosses That female seeds and various
[SPEAKER_01]: others Taken Cindy 99 Various other
varieties of Brothers Grimm have put out
[SPEAKER_01]: and created new hybrids with them So yeah,
it became with me not Again transatlantic
[SPEAKER_01]: not just going one way sending seats to
the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: It became receiving seeds from USA
breeders and then showing them to European
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders That's interesting and did you
ever have any specific communications with
[SPEAKER_00]: sly and I guess the reason why I ask is
I've heard some people describe Brothers
[SPEAKER_00]: Grimm as so was, you know, really good at
the marketing and sly was Doing more of
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any info on that or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: I never met sly but I did meet mr soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came over to the UK and then maybe 20
years ago nearly and I gave him a he rode
[SPEAKER_01]: over with me to Belgium In the car because
I was doing my regular commute to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam shop and he came with me on one
occasion He seemed like a nice fella I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't remember the actual conversation at
the time but Yeah, I I did ask him at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time if it's okay to make f2s or whatever
you call it out of Cindy 99 because we had
[SPEAKER_01]: so many people asking for stock and we
didn't have any more Brothers Grimm stock
[SPEAKER_01]: and it didn't look like he was going to
have any because I think he was working in
[SPEAKER_01]: the engineering field and he had a job in
Europe and So he couldn't concentrate on
[SPEAKER_01]: growing back in the states like he had
done before With sly and I've since
[SPEAKER_01]: learned that sly has passed away in recent
years so Mr. Soul is the only
[SPEAKER_01]: representative now or Brothers Grimm out
there And good luck to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He seemed like a nice chap I didn't really
know him for that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just a car Journey more
than anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the thing with the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might know people for years online but
when they sit next to you in a car and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're on a Four or five hour journey or
whatever it is you get to know them much
[SPEAKER_01]: better that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer the personal Meeting people
that's why I've always made an effort to
[SPEAKER_01]: get around the world to meet various
breeders different times not just to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: stock just to see See how they make their
seeds Yeah Yeah, brilliant brilliant
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you a little bit unrelated
I heard that you were friends with Kanga
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiva and when he got out of jail a few
years ago He went to the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us an update on him if you
know anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's Kanga Tiva I Guess that answers the
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's the um, the Australian grower
who's like associated with mullin bimby
[SPEAKER_00]: madness He was working with Neville on the
grail haze a little bit He's Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: known a few Aussies over the years and I
think they don't go by their online names
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might have known him as somebody else
Yeah, there you go, maybe maybe I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to think of hey how else you might
know him Do you remember Wally Duck at all
[SPEAKER_00]: or not ringing any bells?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah Wally Duck Donald Mallard as we
know him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the one Yeah, he's a mate
that Yeah from back from the early
[SPEAKER_01]: overgrow days again And I'll see a
bushcrow I think he's up in Queensland or
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere They're in the Table Mountains
Yeah, yeah, he's a good mate he's out and
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with all the wildlife and this
that and the other and he was quite
[SPEAKER_01]: descriptive and we got chatting and of
course we shared seeds and He'd send some
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds over That they got over there and I
would send us some more from over here
[SPEAKER_01]: over there and he would grow them out and
Make more seeds and then send them back.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what happened with many breeders
around the world You share the seeds with
[SPEAKER_01]: them and they want to share what seeds
they make with you If you could sell them
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you can give them away and at least
they're being distributed and plants grown
[SPEAKER_01]: from them That was their mindset which is
mine too if you've got seeds that are just
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna waste away They just give them away
and try and get somebody to grow them
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely definitely definitely I I
wanted to ask you who in your mind is like
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the unsung heroes of the scene be
it a breeder or just a Community member
[SPEAKER_00]: who you think like just doesn't really get
as much attention as maybe they merit I
[SPEAKER_01]: think there's a lot of up-and-coming
breeders That Will come to the fore in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future Is the old-school sort of die away
and we can see that happening already
[SPEAKER_01]: within the kind of cannabis subculture or
Industry or you might call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been in prohibition mostly over the
last 80 or 90 years Yeah, there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: have come to prominence and others not but
I think there's a whole new batch of
[SPEAKER_01]: People making seeds now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's new breeders up and coming I could
throw some names around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think That's really the point
because these these guys are the product
[SPEAKER_01]: of what we've created in the online
communities many times We've got people
[SPEAKER_01]: that have grown up we're in the early
teenage years with the overgrow and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they come on to IC mag and they become
readers in their own right and now they've
[SPEAKER_01]: Got their own Instagram accounts and this
and the other their own legitimate seed
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and it's Kind of helping spawn
the industry there's always been One of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things I feel most proud of if there's
anything to be proud of within this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and Helping others And having
something there where they can communicate
[SPEAKER_01]: with like-minded people Whether it's on a
social level or business level or Matter
[SPEAKER_01]: of interest in the plant It seems to work
You can even go in there and have a chat
[SPEAKER_01]: and go in there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the latest software And now
we've upgraded From the old V bulletin
[SPEAKER_01]: software to the new stuff It's a much
better site to navigate I find it
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting, but we don't get the we don't
get the traffic that we used to get
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's so many options now out
there people seem to like Instagram and
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook I'll try to keep the site going
as long as I can Seems to pay the bills at
[SPEAKER_00]: the moment Yeah, people talk like they're
very fond about the forums but Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: still seems to dominate in terms of the
numbers Do you think that there there
[SPEAKER_00]: might be some sort of paradigm shift
because Instagram seemed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: increasingly Banning cannabis accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to advertise Do you think there
might come a time where the forums rise
[SPEAKER_00]: back up and become like the main point of
communication?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't go to these sites There are people
called gypsy nirvana on these sites,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're all doppelgangers or fakes or
whatever Somebody's even coined gypsy
[SPEAKER_01]: nirvana.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I had control of that domain,
but I must have lost it through
[SPEAKER_01]: non-payment or something or other and So
there's somebody out there with with the
[SPEAKER_01]: domain name in my name selling Seeds
that's got nothing to do with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the internet can be good and it can
also be a bloody crazy place when people
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick your identity and go around making
money with it Yes, certainly and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: answered one of the questions I was gonna
ask which is that yeah, the current
[SPEAKER_00]: website looks pretty unanimously like
they're scamming people But I had a
[SPEAKER_01]: suspicion that you weren't involved in it
Well, I guess it's kind of flattering in a
[SPEAKER_01]: in a kind of perverse way, isn't it when
you think of it Yeah, certainly certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: we had um Some interesting fans submitted
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to know the answer Someone
wanted to know the backstory behind
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the genetics of the citral or the
bubble issues Do you remember either of
[SPEAKER_00]: those two specifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, geez I'm only running a 486 kilobyte
Hard drive in this brain, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I got to pull up that information
somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go back to the 1980s There's one
of these weird modems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to connect and it makes all these
odd noises these clicks So it was citral
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah and Bubblicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe she's Wasn't Bubblicious
something that Now put out Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I think they were both from
Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah as a form of bubblegum Yeah,
because they're the Dutch breeders or seed
[SPEAKER_01]: makers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all into knocking each other off big
time, you know, I think now had this
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly potent skunk male that he'd
got from Sam and took most all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: popular clones or anything that won a
title or a cannabis cup or whatever and
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated them with this particularly
strong resinous nail and Seemed to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds that in many cases were even better
than the originals as far as potency or
[SPEAKER_01]: even yield was concerned So just by making
these hybrids Shaking around the pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: From this this very good male enabled him
to start a whole seed company out of it a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the Dutch breeders worked it that
way, you know, and I mean I've heard in
[SPEAKER_01]: the past is ongoing core cases and and All
sorts of consternation between various
[SPEAKER_01]: companies using the names of seeds of
somebody else that's created them like
[SPEAKER_01]: Simon From serious seeds and the ak-47 Mel
started selling something that was called
[SPEAKER_01]: ak-47 as well and of course Simon didn't
like it so they brought a court case or
[SPEAKER_01]: They get involved in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost gets criminal almost to the
point of violence amongst these people And
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually I think now changed it to ak-48
yeah So he started selling it as ak-48 So
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah amongst a lot of these Dutch breeders
or seed makers It's not that they all
[SPEAKER_01]: produce their own special varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Some very good varieties that go
around and they make hybrids off of all of
[SPEAKER_00]: them to a lesser or greater extent
Brilliant brilliant and another question
[SPEAKER_00]: we got asked by a listener was do you
specifically have any?
[SPEAKER_00]: recollection around when Nirvana Did their
remakes of some of the classics like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights and the White Widow were
like two notable ones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Well, I know now he would go for What
is the correct genetic material to create
[SPEAKER_01]: something?
[SPEAKER_01]: He started out with Bernard positronics So
he knows the value of producing something
[SPEAKER_01]: that the public will like the growing
public will like and I'm sure he would
[SPEAKER_01]: have put together something that was
popular You know, there's been a few I
[SPEAKER_01]: think in the past there's been a few
releases of seeds that have not come up to
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations Because they haven't been
tested or whatever but I think Mao always
[SPEAKER_01]: tried to get Tested and looked at me as a
good outlet for testing when I I got the
[SPEAKER_01]: website together So we would do you know
test grows if I would get a batch of seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: something coming up new I put them out to
growers on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to see them in live action
You know how they would grow out they put
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures up now and then other people
would buy on that Whether or not they be
[SPEAKER_01]: all different types of phenotypes and some
stunted and there's some mutant plants
[SPEAKER_01]: Then people wouldn't be so keen on buying
them would they?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting I mean one of the
questions we got asked by a few different
[SPEAKER_00]: people was like a lot of people in general
have this sort of fond memory of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the African lines you sold and I guess I'm
wondering who did those come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you have any seed stock in general
laying around or it's all sort of gone
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Mostly it's gone because I've moved
around a lot I've been in places that I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't plan on being for for a long amount
of time and I haven't been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate on Securing and keeping the
seed stock that I've had in good repair so
[SPEAKER_01]: to speak Like when I was away in in the
Philippines in jail My seed stock wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: kept refrigerated and It was just left in
an office with employees that were kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: lackluster and a bit worried about
themselves getting in trouble for
[SPEAKER_01]: operating this business so obviously
germination ratios dropped off and Yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually You know I came back and I had
You know loads and loads of seed stock,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the majority of it wasn't worth or
couldn't really be sold as anything other
[SPEAKER_01]: than badly germinating seeds, so Yeah,
I lost a whole fortune in the stock that I
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulated over many years because of my
incarceration Yeah, wow that's that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bummer to hear I can only imagine all the
beautiful things that would have been
[SPEAKER_00]: there otherwise One of the listeners
wanted to know they asked a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about if you could tell it I'm actually
not 100% familiar with this so it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you don't they said Can he tell us a
little bit about the haze drama?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe they're talking about the
amazing haze you gave out Is there some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of story behind that or not really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's been so many haze hybrids and
Hazes over the years that I've come into
[SPEAKER_01]: contact with I can't even remember half of
them to tell you the truth because haze
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to have got into so many different
cultivars and and Crosses and hybrids
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you want to call them That it's
difficult to quantify What do you think of
[SPEAKER_00]: when I say haze?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know the roots of it supposedly It
was something that came from the haze
[SPEAKER_01]: brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mostly made out of a Colombian of
some sort some South American origin and
[SPEAKER_01]: It was passed on to Sam Sam brought it
over to Europe and grew it out and It
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't always grow true apparently It's
got a lot of different phenos and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to search for the good one You know,
it's a bit variable I've heard people say
[SPEAKER_01]: that occasionally it had intersex traits
Maybe you know, it depends on how somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: grows something out As well that can
affect all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's difficult to work out exactly What
the haze is or what it was it's kind of in
[SPEAKER_01]: folklore now almost and there's people In
contention about it and will forever argue
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, you know About Neville's haze
and about Sam and we've had ongoing
[SPEAKER_01]: discussions That go through hundreds and
hundreds of pages on ICMAG about the
[SPEAKER_00]: mysterious haze That's interesting yeah,
it um, it's still just so much discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: around it that's interesting to hear It's
the effect of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that more than anything Is most
cannabis people smoke I think these days
[SPEAKER_01]: or consume or be You know, however,
they take cannabis most of it is more of
[SPEAKER_01]: something that relaxes you that makes you
lower in consciousness perhaps Whereas the
[SPEAKER_01]: haze has kind of the opposite effect and
it is very Extreme I think to most
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis users because the majority never
even tried it That's the interest,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's kind of What was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the absence of cannabis That's a
good way to put it I like it there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: allure about it for sure Well,
if you could only pick one strain to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: for the rest of your life, what strain
would you pick?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Well, whatever I say people will
disagree with me because they prefer their
[SPEAKER_01]: own but as far as Haze is a concern
Sometimes I think it's a it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: too much on the edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't pick a haze but I picked
something that was a Nice hybrid like
[SPEAKER_01]: Cinderella 99 that would suit me Something
that's fast grows indoors very fruity
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful kind of dank kind of fruitiness
pineapple papaya fruitiness that
[SPEAKER_01]: Cinderella 99 has it's almost It's almost
like a candy Remember the first time I've
[SPEAKER_01]: tried any other sent one of those old film
cases for by mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soul, I think it was and Yeah,
ever since then I've been a Cindy freak
[SPEAKER_01]: That does me I could survive on Cinderella
99 for the rest of my days Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's brilliant isn't it really functional
lovely stuff So I got another question
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of similar to the last one and this
one was submitted by one of our listeners
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to know if you had to start
growing today and you had to buy seeds of
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the breeders that currently is
around What seeds would you buy if you
[SPEAKER_00]: could only get one pack?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh jeez God, that's a tricky one in it
Because there's so much variety and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much good It's like say a kid
that really likes chocolate and you say
[SPEAKER_01]: all right, what have all these chocolate
bars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're all chocolate Yeah,
oh this is a hard one very hard one First
[SPEAKER_01]: of all, I'd I'd look at the breeders that
I Kind of admire and would stand behind
[SPEAKER_01]: their product And they are not just
something that's made Conveniently from
[SPEAKER_01]: another breed of seeds and relabeled and
called something else I'd look to be
[SPEAKER_01]: growing something that was Maybe Original
maybe getting nostalgic looking back
[SPEAKER_01]: growing one of the mainstays of the of the
current industry maybe just growing out a
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk one or growing out a northern lights
or something kind of not too fancy doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a Name that incorporates all sorts
weird gizmos That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question we got was What was your
recollection of Tom Hill and his lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw them for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any fond memories any specific
memories?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom Hill, he's the roller coaster of a
person really Great guy, but then I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people wouldn't say that
Yeah, it's kind of a bit of an enigma and
[SPEAKER_01]: tends to come on my site sometimes in one
mood and then gets along with most people
[SPEAKER_01]: then comes on in another mood and pisses
off a load of people and ends up getting
[SPEAKER_01]: the moderators to ban him well,
he gets himself banned through breaking
[SPEAKER_01]: the terms of use or whatever but Yeah,
I don't know many years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a package in the mail and it was all
these seeds from somebody called Tom Hill
[SPEAKER_01]: and I didn't know where they're coming
from particularly and then he kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: hooked up with me on the website and said
yeah I sent all these seeds over you can
[SPEAKER_01]: just give them away or sell them whatever
you want, you know, so we sold some we
[SPEAKER_01]: gave some away and and people seem to like
them and then he became more vocal on the
[SPEAKER_01]: forums and I don't know a lot of people
liked his style, but Yeah, he used to I
[SPEAKER_01]: think his thing was rum and coke and maybe
when people drink a lot They tend to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit sloppy online and yeah he was kind of
Informative interesting but at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time insulted to a lot of people and put
it across in He didn't he didn't coat it
[SPEAKER_01]: with any sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: Straight to the point that's kind of
people like that if if somebody comes
[SPEAKER_01]: across sometimes a bit crude and Makes
their point with passion So Tom was very
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate like that and I think I met him
Invited him to come out to the Philippines
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago and he came out We went out and
had a couple nights out on the town
[SPEAKER_01]: together Got absolutely blotto Had some
good times seemed like a nice guy really
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he grows up in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been he's kind of like a mountain
man, you know Foothills of the Rockies or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a few stories together and Yeah,
interesting chapter there again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about personalities You see you've
got some wild men of cannabis and I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom is one of them I Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask were there any particular
standout Cannabis Cup experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've been to a number of them
anything kooky or wild that we haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: spoke about Yeah, there was one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the second year I had
anything to do with them and maybe the
[SPEAKER_01]: last was I Wanted to enter Cinderella 99
in the Cannabis Cup So this is a big deal
[SPEAKER_01]: for me the first time I ever made an entry
I Cleared it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we missed a soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said look we want to enter This into the
Cannabis Cup where you please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So We we were waiting for the
authorization and they needed to come and
[SPEAKER_01]: pick weed up and the guy came over from
the Cannabis Cup and you know in a
[SPEAKER_01]: roundabout way they told Me that if I
wanted it to place I would have to pay a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain amount of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was kind of corrupt and
that led led on to us wanting to know
[SPEAKER_01]: every year to the the growers and breeders
Cup we wanted to do our own kind of mini
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Cup just amongst the growers and
the breeders of the plum so we started
[SPEAKER_01]: this 420 growers and breeders Cup so The
20th of April every year We put a show on
[SPEAKER_01]: some years We employed Tribute bands we
had an AC DC tribute band one year a big
[SPEAKER_01]: venue and I used to fork out a lot of a
lot of dough to try and get this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: happening But I'm not very Very together
with organization and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something years It didn't really
work out, but there was still a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: entries and a lot of people showed up for
it so It just financially was a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: drain so eventually it just became Maybe
50 or 60 growers and breeders would show
[SPEAKER_01]: up and then they judge each other's weed
That was the last time I think we had it
[SPEAKER_01]: just pre-covid We haven't had one since
But there are plans to put one on for next
[SPEAKER_01]: year And yeah, we started it in a way
Because I thought the Cannabis Cup was
[SPEAKER_01]: corrupt and we thought it might be more
interesting particularly the the growers
[SPEAKER_01]: and the breeders on on International
Cannographic to Have some sort of event
[SPEAKER_01]: every year where they could get together
and meet each other and I think we've done
[SPEAKER_01]: it in Amsterdam mostly and for a couple of
years we did it in Barcelona and Hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: we can get it on for next year again and I
can go along and pass out on all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different varieties I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to ask and follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which Canada's Cup was that the one you
want to tend to the Cindy in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeez high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah There you go, there you go We had one
of our listeners ask about the gypsy
[SPEAKER_00]: nirvana collection of seeds Can you tell
us anything about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah ever since the get-go I've had
Some favorite varieties that I would put
[SPEAKER_01]: into my collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I Either they'd be rare land-race
stuff that I've found on my travels Or
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd be from different breeders that had
certain seed lots that I thought were
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly good And so I'd put them in
the collection So there's been several
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties that have gone through the
collection over the years and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think I have any of them left enough
unless there's ones that are still up on
[SPEAKER_01]: seed Bay or seed boutique and They would
more likely be newer seeds because I've
[SPEAKER_01]: told them We don't want to try and sell
the older seeds anymore because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: just not good The older varieties
obviously Stock Runs out so we don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: them all the time and So we have to
introduce new varieties Occasionally I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: looking around or something good to put
into the gypsy nirvana collection and
[SPEAKER_00]: currently I Can't think of anything That's
interesting great someone wanted to know
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically Did you know anything about
the G 13 in cross or is that like a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: too specific?
[SPEAKER_01]: hmm, I know this G 13 plant it was
supposedly from some American government
[SPEAKER_01]: institution in Mississippi, you know this
folklore going on about it and What has
[SPEAKER_01]: been presumed to be the G 13 I think Ben
did most with it initially I think he
[SPEAKER_01]: crossed it with the hash plant now the G
13 hash plant at sensei seeds Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: very famous nowadays, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that became Known as the mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Nice cross after how it marks G 13
backwards how would be an instrumental in
[SPEAKER_01]: me getting released from Philippine
authorities In the Philippines back in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2016 Howard was an Oxford Don and he met
many people who are now heads of
[SPEAKER_01]: government and industry Today,
yeah, he probably sold them hash back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 70s or the 60s or whatever and He
pulled some strings with the British
[SPEAKER_01]: diplomatic corps To get send one of the
top dogs to meet me in the Philippines And
[SPEAKER_01]: then after he met me the British Embassy
couldn't do enough to help me get out of
[SPEAKER_01]: there so I Got out the year Howard died
and I didn't get a chance to actually go
[SPEAKER_01]: and thank him But I think he talked to the
right person or pulled some strings to get
[SPEAKER_01]: me out of that that hill hole in the
Philippines that ex Marcos era death camp
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was In scorned within and couldn't
find a way out of for two and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bless Howard Marks Bless Howard Marks
having a brilliant effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that just about brings us to our
quickfire questions So I wanted to ask you
[SPEAKER_00]: first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you most proud of out of your
career thus far?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a proud father I'm proud to have
brought seven kids into this world and
[SPEAKER_01]: been able to support them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Guess that's brilliant Well as far as
cannabis is concerned I'm glad that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced a lot of people to it and it's
helped them in many ways maybe there's one
[SPEAKER_01]: or two that have fallen by the wayside,
but I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same with anything you do in
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a risk concerned with it
and it's up to you to quantify that risk
[SPEAKER_01]: and whether or not to take it or not and
I've taken a few risks that weren't really
[SPEAKER_01]: in my favor and become a cropper in the
past but if you don't keep going forward
[SPEAKER_01]: and Pushing for what you believe is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you're looking for change or
looking for a living The cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_01]: has offered me all that over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't regret anything I've done really
You almost got me there I was about to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: that so I will pray It differently
although you don't regret anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you wish you could have
done differently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well there was this guy is this
online entity called John Lee Pettimore
[SPEAKER_01]: JLP and we had this plan to aerially
bombard various parts of the globe with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis seeds With balloons, you know,
and we were very into working out the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole science And you know the weather and
this that and the other how we could like
[SPEAKER_01]: invade various nations with plants that
would grow from the get-go in the right
[SPEAKER_01]: season at the right time you see and Just
forced cannabis on the rest of the world
[SPEAKER_01]: Bit of a pipe dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must say but yeah, I'm kind of sad that
we didn't explore that a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next one is what is the single best
Flower you've ever had It might have been
[SPEAKER_01]: the most recent one that I experienced
over in Amsterdam a couple of weeks ago
[SPEAKER_01]: Simon from Syria seeds offered me a very
beautiful mimosa But it's this variety
[SPEAKER_01]: that he has called mimosa which was an
offering and a gift and of course It
[SPEAKER_01]: looked Beautiful and it was cured properly
and it smoked like a dream And that was
[SPEAKER_01]: the same day that I passed out on soma's
bubble hash soma salad So Some weird
[SPEAKER_01]: dreams of that day being in and out of
consciousness whether or not the mimosa
[SPEAKER_01]: Contributed to it or not You can't really
say not that I would say with my own blood
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry perhaps That's brilliant sounds
like a fun time either way, but on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other end of the spectrum What's some bud
where everyone around you is hyping it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really looking forward to trying it
and then when you finally did you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, is that it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all various varieties of cannabis
have some sort of attribute nearly by
[SPEAKER_01]: being cannabis itself, you know,
it's something And whether or not it's got
[SPEAKER_01]: 1% THC or it's got 35% THC on it seems to
be a common denominator whereby people
[SPEAKER_01]: will judge how good or bad it is,
but not from my Experience, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got just as high in some respects or
even higher on Cannabis that has a lower
[SPEAKER_01]: THC level and I have done on stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not neither six, you know Is it
really all about becoming comatose?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, you want to Try and plateau out
before you become comatose and enjoy a
[SPEAKER_01]: high You don't just pass out or do you you
know some people's Some people's lives are
[SPEAKER_01]: so grim that just being under a chemical
kosh Is a relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it's horses for courses as my
mother would say Depends what works with
[SPEAKER_01]: you in your own metabolism and what
particular time you take it and what
[SPEAKER_00]: company you take it with That's it right
different strokes for different folks So
[SPEAKER_00]: we're on a boat and I'm gonna drop you off
on a desert island You can take three
[SPEAKER_00]: strains with you for the rest of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What three would you take?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, the island would have to
have a good water source and the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: would have to be decent Surprisingly,
it's got everything Lots of coconuts Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, yeah lots of fan leaves that shade
you I take the basic building blocks of
[SPEAKER_01]: what we mostly got today I take a very
good haze I take a really good skunk one
[SPEAKER_01]: and Maybe a northern lights five and you
can make a lot of things from that Come
[SPEAKER_00]: back in ten years and you've rebuilt
cookies from scratch Okay, so this I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought is it's a different one to what we
normally ask people and I wanted you to I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to hear your perspective on it
looking back What do you think were some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the best seeds you ever had available
commercially?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got I had an interest in giving away
Certain varieties of seeds in the past
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think I thought that the ones
you give away are the most important ones
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're more than likely the first
seed somebody might grow So you've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: start it with a bang I remember I Had this
seed lot made once called those who who's
[SPEAKER_01]: your daddy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah And basically what I did I think I
took a whole bunch of power plant and The
[SPEAKER_01]: clones, you know top commercial clones at
the time in Holland and I situated a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of different males around the room
that matured and spread their pollen all
[SPEAKER_01]: over these different power plant clones
and Yeah, we'll call it who's your daddy
[SPEAKER_01]: because we didn't know who the daddy was
knew it was power plant and Then made a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole bunch of seeds a couple kilos of
seeds out of that I think and just gave
[SPEAKER_01]: them away for eons and just about
everybody that grew them out was happy But
[SPEAKER_01]: they got a wonderful plant that flowered
fairly fast was a good yield and had nice
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes to it So yeah, those are some of
the more fun things that we've done in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past Giving away batches of seeds that I
know great and you could probably sell
[SPEAKER_01]: them for a lot of money But knowing
they're the first seeds a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: will grow and to make sure that they grow
something that they would really enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant I love it not the answer
I was expecting but the answer we deserved
[SPEAKER_00]: so Final question we ask people if I could
give you a time machine and you could go
[SPEAKER_00]: back anywhere any point in history
Presumably to get either clones or seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you gonna go?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are you gonna collect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Goodness gracious me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like Philias fog around the world
in 80 days Who's gonna be my passport to
[SPEAKER_01]: now and do the collecting?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was to go back in history Well,
you know The enormous Indian hemp trade
[SPEAKER_01]: that there was Amongst I think it was the
East India Company particularly in the UK
[SPEAKER_01]: and throughout the world India Was one of
the prime growers of cannabis going back
[SPEAKER_01]: to the 1718 hundreds and to be able to go
back to a time like that and peruse
[SPEAKER_01]: through thousands of plants in the fields
and make selections and be able to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic material from that stuff back into
the present Yeah, it could be a kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: time tunnel episode at the very least That
would be incredible a brilliant pool to
[SPEAKER_00]: select from and a great answer in general
So I think that just about brings us to
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of it for this one Are there any
comments or shout outs you'd like to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just wish that any viewers out there
have an enjoyable experience with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis that they grow during their life
And for the ones that I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: Instrumental with helping in the past in
the present and maybe in the future grow
[SPEAKER_00]: on Brilliant sentiment.
