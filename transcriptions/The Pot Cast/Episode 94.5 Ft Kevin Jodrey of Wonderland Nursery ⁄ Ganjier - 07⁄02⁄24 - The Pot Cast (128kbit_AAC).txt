[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are so appreciative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're here for part two of our
interview with Kevin Jodry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking all things breeding, growing,
history, his recent trip to Pakistan and
[SPEAKER_00]: so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without further delay, let's get into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just spoke about how
different latitudes produce sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: different effects based on the original
land races and I think a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: listening are waiting for us to delve into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if anyone's been paying
attention to your Instagram, you had what
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like a really epic recent trip over
to Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to talk a bit about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What stimulated this?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did all the ball get rolling?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, that was an epic adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say enough about the Pakistan,
the team I was with and the people of
[SPEAKER_01]: Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What started it was there was a group on,
you know, yeah, we're all online,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I had done some work with the Indian
land race group where they had reached out
[SPEAKER_01]: to me and said, hey, we're trying to do
some promotion to get people to be more
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of genetic preservation and that
even though, you know, when you take the
[SPEAKER_01]: genes from one nation and small population
and move them, you're not really doing an
[SPEAKER_01]: official preservation, but the idea that
some of the genes stay alive and get
[SPEAKER_01]: shared and hopefully bring back some value
to the farmer was what they desired.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I say, hey, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like a great project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I'll participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I did is I took some of the genes
and I created a population, but I cleaned
[SPEAKER_01]: them up a little bit and got the intersex
traits out because I knew that most people
[SPEAKER_01]: were going to grow them indoor and I gave
them out at conferences all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I shared them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what it did is it, and all I asked
is for people to give credit to the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers in the region of Ghazni,
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this way, what we're doing is we're
showing the, this relevancy of others that
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end of the day, all small
cultivators are connected around the world
[SPEAKER_01]: by virtue of our craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that it was successful where it
brought a lot of attention to that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was something I was really into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it, it caught the, it caught the
eye of, you know, two groups, land race,
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, and let's be friends,
Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's, let's be friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pakistan is a tourism group and land race
genetics is a genetics collection group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they reach out to me and say,
Hey, you know, we just want to be your
[SPEAKER_01]: friend online and just chat with you once
in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we become friends and we chat once
in a while over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, we have this idea that we've
been working on and we want to know if
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd be interested in coming out to
Pakistan and experiencing our country and
[SPEAKER_01]: traveling the Silk route and doing a
collection with land race genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's something that's positive for
you to let the public know that this was a
[SPEAKER_01]: good place and that our people are good,
kind people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds so simple, you know,
and it's just that Pakistan has such a
[SPEAKER_01]: horrific reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I got a text when I was ready to
fly out about chopping my head off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, the people, people believe
that we were going to go there and be
[SPEAKER_01]: murdered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't believe that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been, I mean, I had a fantasy of
going to Pakistan since I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always wanted to see these regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just bummed that I couldn't
because of the wars in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I got invited out by these two
groups, I'd spent enough time talking to
[SPEAKER_01]: them online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew they didn't want to cut off my
head.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they wanted was they wanted to,
they're either young, they're thirties and
[SPEAKER_01]: forties and I'm almost 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they wanted was they wanted to be
able to bring attention in a positive way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was such a, I want to say like lack
of a better word, noble, endeavor that I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like, man, I'm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll support it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I fly out to Pakistan and I'm with
a green walrus, Danny and his team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm with two dudes from, from England.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them, that's a breeder and another
one that's working with an operation in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia from relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Neil from relief was with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're called the internationals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was one of the cat to Imran from
Canada, who was a premium extractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was interested as hell too,
because he's a really talented like street
[SPEAKER_01]: dancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so every cool place he's been on the
earth, he goes and dances with the people
[SPEAKER_01]: and does some cool shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Pakistan was live because the
backgrounds were wicked and he would throw
[SPEAKER_01]: on some, on some music and just tear it
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this kid can move.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really this interesting trip
that they had gathered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us knew each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was just people that let's be
friends, Pakistan and land race genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: had connected to, you know, over the last
year or two and realize that, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you, you all make a pretty good
diverse group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that if you all traveled together
with us, it'd be really a good adventure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they put this idea together to travel
the ancient silk route, the route that
[SPEAKER_01]: connected the world really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were going to travel the silk route
and then go explore the cannabis regions,
[SPEAKER_01]: do some collecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And enjoy, you know, the time together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the single most insane trip
I've ever been on in my life, because when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're traveling the silk route,
you are literally traveling the Kura-Kuram
[SPEAKER_01]: highway, which is like the deadliest road
in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you got landslides going down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so rugged.
[SPEAKER_01]: It let me understand like the first time
I've had the concept of verticality where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're at like, I think the
highest we went, we went over pass was
[SPEAKER_01]: like 14,000, but the mountains around it
were 14,000 feet higher than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you have this up and down that
your neck gets tired from trying to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at the base and to the top of something
because it's beyond comprehension.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the, there's four ranges that
come together, but the Kura-Kuram,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Himalayas and the Hindu Kush all
collide there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through those glaciers that feed at
7,000 glaciers up through Nepal and to
[SPEAKER_01]: Pakistan, it creates the Indus river.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Indus river is feeding,
you know, one third of the earth's
[SPEAKER_01]: population with fresh water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a river that's twice as big as the
Nile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the birthplaces of
humankind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this, if this, these areas to me
were just like mythical because I had
[SPEAKER_01]: studied them as a kid and I'm in love with
herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm fascinated by the regions that
really developed all the varieties that we
[SPEAKER_01]: use so much in North America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ability to go and visit this place
was just surreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the teams were awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Lesby friends, Pakistan put a trip on
that couldn't have been any more
[SPEAKER_01]: comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like every day you were 24 seven
experiencing Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you left, you were almost a
native.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me to go and get to do some
collection work with the land race crew
[SPEAKER_01]: was awesome because they'd spent the last
seven years practicing collecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they knew the regions and they knew
the profiles and they knew what profiles
[SPEAKER_01]: were coming from what type of gardens,
what type of companion plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: like they had a really intuitive,
technically developed view of the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it made it awesome for me because,
you know, hanging out with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: wheat freaks is never bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hunting herb in the mountains with
people that are able to help you
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what the patterns that they
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're just there to participate
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't there to teach them anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there just to work with them as a
friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just totally cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was like total camaraderie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we arrived, the group said,
hey, we know you guys smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got you six quarter pounds of indoor
grown in Pakistan, which was fire and five
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred grams, half a kilo hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had and there was probably like
seven kinds of hash, but it made up a
[SPEAKER_01]: total of five hundred grams, all kilo hash
from Tira.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's going to be a good time
when you show up and there's a pound and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half of herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and half a key hash to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we basically smoked our way through
the.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trails and explored the mountains and
the people of Pakistan and got to check
[SPEAKER_01]: out some stunning cannabis varieties with
patterns and profiles that I really can't
[SPEAKER_01]: describe because I don't have the ability
to describe them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was it was so interesting to find the
true outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's that's absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure everyone's, you know,
very jealous.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a what a warm welcome, you know,
a pound and a half and half kilo of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, beautiful men knows how to
welcome people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the first question I'd love to ask
is, you know, what was some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: standout sort of profiles or plans you
came across on that journey?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's the one that resonated
more than any was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say it was the only way you
could describe it would be some form of
[SPEAKER_01]: like lacquer thinner combined with every
ingredient in an exotic spice shop and
[SPEAKER_01]: then swirl that shit together and then
turn the volume up to 10 where this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: screamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smell that emanated off that plant
just ripped through a field when when when
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't find that when Jamie found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he finds it and he yells,
whoa, and he shakes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can hear him, you know, shaking
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the odor led us to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, you were to feel the weed and
it was so volatile that just him moving
[SPEAKER_01]: it, post it through the entire crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a another profile I really
loved, but I was I would say it's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: classic Kush and that we would say,
what is classic Kush, that dirty,
[SPEAKER_01]: earthy, tobaccoy cigar box.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now take all that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And clean it up, clean it up and refine
each one of those flavors so that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: clear and crisp and defined and then weave
them all together so that you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: having this this this explosion in your
nose of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think you're in some type of
haberdashery, like a clothing store where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's fine, fine epicurean tobacco and
the smell of the wood and the fabric and
[SPEAKER_01]: the material just leather.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was plants that were so wet with
essential oil that when you rubbed against
[SPEAKER_01]: them, it wet your arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to look up and I laughed,
too, because I did it multiple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, oh, it must have rained.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it because it was they were literally
wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just dumping liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you found plants that were the
polar opposite with a bone dry,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they had the most granular grain and
gritty rising heads just.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we did is we basically looked
for everything that had good morphology,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the plant had a decent frame on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was interesting, too,
because the mineral levels are so high
[SPEAKER_01]: from the glacier that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That the plants are just absolutely
leathered when when you tried to rip a
[SPEAKER_01]: branch off, I mean, it almost cut your
hands trying to pull the bark through your
[SPEAKER_01]: fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was you had to tear them off and put
your feet on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at a lot of plants today,
you can peel them off with your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: This shit was cemented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you cut it with a knife,
it was so lignified.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like a cannabis stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was almost like a semi hardwood,
just so minerally dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The food was like that, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super high mineral levels in the food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just notice some very extreme
differences than what we're used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we did is we just look for
outliers that caught our eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you would just go and go through
hundreds of plants, just going plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was what seven of us,
eight of us together looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would look through a shitload of
plants and anybody who found something
[SPEAKER_01]: they thought was an outlier would yell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd come over and look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would then identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it is it something unique?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we write.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why was it unique?
[SPEAKER_01]: Code it and then then bag it and double
tag it so that we had the plant to sift
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time we found something similar,
we would go to the journal and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, this is something similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we think this plant is better or worse
than the one we collected?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it was better than we would collect
it and put it into the journal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, it gave us like
60 plants that we had collected out of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, eight different collection
sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that that allowed us now to be
able to break those into categories where
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to say, OK, these are these are
earth categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the ones that have some of these
fruit profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the ones that are colored in
this direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are these are all purple,
almost black.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are these are a matrix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me start to create kind of
divisions of what we were looking at and
[SPEAKER_01]: why we were grabbing it and how to kind of
explain it to the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what we did is we took that that
truckload of plants, 60 plants and trash
[SPEAKER_01]: bags, fill the truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as we got to the hotel at
night, we would break the plants down and
[SPEAKER_01]: start to separate the buds from the bodies
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then because it's so dry there,
we would leave them out at night and they
[SPEAKER_01]: would slowly dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in the morning we would seal
everything up and then move to the next
[SPEAKER_01]: site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we did, but every night we would
open every one of the bags either on the
[SPEAKER_01]: roof of the building or on the on the
porches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything was organized and we would
work as a team, constantly allowing the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants to dry enough to decede so that at
the end of the at the end of the trip,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we had was a case of product versus a
pickup truck of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once we go back to Lahore,
we're able to go through and do a final
[SPEAKER_01]: sift and cleansing and get rid of all the
chaffed seed, get rid of all the
[SPEAKER_01]: undeveloped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there should be a picture on my IG of
a tabletop filled with bags of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each one of those reflect the ones we
kept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only one we really got rid of was
we selected it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we broke into it, we realized it
was a bug factory where that we didn't see
[SPEAKER_01]: any real pest problems on any plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was incredible resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one plant had every if there was a bug
in Pakistan, it was on that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we laughed and said, well,
however nice the smell, this is exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: the last plant one wants to bring into
their grow world because it's a trap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having trap plants is great,
but also not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome to hear the process behind
it all and how you were able to get so
[SPEAKER_00]: many cool different samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our fans submitted questions was if
you had to pick just one of the lines that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were able to secure, which one are you
most excited to dig through?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That first one I talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say it's 4D.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each one of the sites was numbered with
a number and then each selection was given
[SPEAKER_01]: a letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had eight sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had one through eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then each location had a variable
amount of selections made, some one,
[SPEAKER_01]: two, some ten, just depend on it was
really all quality based.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that first one, that first one was so
noxious and ferocious and and crazy that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I want to go there first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I second I would go into those
cushions that I chose because I really
[SPEAKER_01]: love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tobacco, coffee, chocolate, you know,
that old world type profile, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the like a true Bubba Kush, even like
Gorilla Glue is similar, that chocolatey
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor done right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to me, that's just an epic
profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are the ones I go into
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's that first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the beauty of it, too, was that it was
an absolute dumper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dumper means that it had an incredible
collection of seed that were fully ripe on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, which some of the plants did
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I don't see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed that's developed that lets me know
that the plant's going to have a longer
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering period, and that doesn't work
well for most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the way the Pakistanis work it is
they don't they don't sift females.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they do is they sift males.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's their male selection that they
work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't they don't do like a true open
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a selected pollination and they
choose the males both on purple and green.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get both colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple is more for frost resistance,
from their opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit more resistant to
issues, but they think the green has a
[SPEAKER_01]: more interesting chemo type.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they make sure that there's both males
in the field all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they choose the ones that have
the best vigor, you know, best display of
[SPEAKER_01]: flower formation, best odor, just the
qualities that someone would seek in a
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinating male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a diversity of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they rogue out most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can you can kind of see the
consistency in pollination because they
[SPEAKER_01]: culled out all the males early.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, it lets you at least be able
to compare the plants to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a true pollination, it's a
nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know if the plant was the male
that triggered quick and pollinated or it
[SPEAKER_01]: was the female early.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's all the same males and then
the females are different, we can say,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, this one has a reasonable finish time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one that I liked the most was the
seeds were phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we saw, too, was incredible
diversity in seed size from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: huge like, you know, pinky tip to
microscopic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you looked at it under a loop,
they were completely developed,
[SPEAKER_01]: complete perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same deal because you got to
remember that for the Pakistanis and
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghanis, cannabis was first a food source
before it was a drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it still is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they use the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: To survive the winters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they roast it with wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way they're getting all the fats
and the omegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives them great health.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use the byproduct as a tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they also bang out some hash for
hash places like Tira, which are which is
[SPEAKER_01]: the primary hash region of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their primary function is hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the other products, second and third.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas most of Pakistan seed primary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and they don't breed for big seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds either, because what they want is
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're they're intelligent in a way
that only someone who's been touching a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant for eighteen hundred years,
fifteen hundred years can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely some wisdom in a lot of the
different practices you just mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: them doing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to ask, you know, on the other
end of the spectrum, did you see any
[SPEAKER_00]: population contamination while over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any European or American genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a quick follow up, what was sort of
the farmer's perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they aware of like American and sort
of more Western genetics at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they are, because the one thing I
noticed in the world, no matter what
[SPEAKER_01]: elevation, altitude, location,
everybody's got a cell phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, the whole world is on
IG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're fully aware, but they
they're kind of protected in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: different than like Morocco, Lebanon,
where tourism is still, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty prevalent to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pakistan has been on a 20 year hiatus
where people really haven't been there
[SPEAKER_01]: since 9 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I only saw one white person
the entire time I was there, and that was
[SPEAKER_01]: a German tourist and German tourists and
notorious for going where no one will go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, if there's if there's if
there's a single white person anywhere up
[SPEAKER_01]: in the side of a mountain, I would say
it's probably a German tourist because
[SPEAKER_01]: they they absolutely ferocious on
exploring.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were the only white people we saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I spoke to all the different
farmers and all the different groups,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the questions I was asking were,
you know, do you hold your lines
[SPEAKER_01]: individually?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, no, we all share.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all share the lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We choose best stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have great crops, we share the seeds
with others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't have any infiltration from
any American or Dutch genes because nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: had been over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was it was awesome to see that that
it was still this protected population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, they are curious about the the
end, you know, about the the new genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where you see those develop,
they're not in the outdoor fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is in the new indoor industry of
Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Pakistan and the upper middle
class, high class financial level people,
[SPEAKER_01]: the kids of that world, they want Western
type shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they want to smoke gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want indoor runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we got there and they broke
out this weed, I looked at it and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just said, this is a really good
grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, this shit is not outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, no, it's indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, how'd you ship it in?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said we didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our friends grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They imported all their grow equipment
from another country and they have an
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor sparked up at their house or at a
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are producing this good indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was cracking up because,
you know, it was like lemon sorbet and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, shit that you see in a
California market, but in Pakistan and
[SPEAKER_01]: done correctly, it was really well done,
like well done, well grown weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the indoor is what the the the trendies
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you only see the genes coming in on
the indoor end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, as time went
on, I it was awesome having Imran there
[SPEAKER_01]: because Imran's a really talented
extractor, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was neat to see him in the the
native extractors hanging out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, talking shop because they work
off of dry sift static.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when we're talking,
they're working on the dry stiff static.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that Saeed that we were rolling
with, he's got a four acre patch himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's hand sifting four acres of
cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like, you know, and his first memory
is like, you know, I asked him,
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, you know, what what what was it
like being a kid, you know, like in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world of cannabis here?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, oh, man, my first memories of
helping my dad when I was three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm in my late 30s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I spent my whole life
basically making hash with my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm the senior hash maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just had a familiarity and
comfort with the product that was
[SPEAKER_01]: refreshing, because what we've done is
we've become so obsessed with this
[SPEAKER_01]: perfection that it to me, it's bougie
where, you know, every detail has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: just right or it can't cross your lips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and majority of smoke in
Pakistan is being smoked in tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: wrapped around a cigarette or inside a
cigarette.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people were like, oh, God,
they need an education or a lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, that's how they consume it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not right or wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just our perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would love to have had, you know,
someone like Saeed come back to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and go to a hash operation and watch them
make cash in this in this new world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then have all those hash makers go
back to Pakistan and work dry sift tech
[SPEAKER_01]: with them because they're having to do it
with far less resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the the art is greater than the
science, where in our world, the science
[SPEAKER_01]: is becoming greater than the art.
And.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to meld both of them for
incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: A great scientist is an artist and a great
artist is a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that where the focus lie,
but you can't separate the two of them
[SPEAKER_01]: completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Art by itself has no end and science by
itself has no direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you can put them together,
you form like some incredible stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's DaVinci DaVinci was art and
science merged.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, you know, when you when you look
at it from that perspective, it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: it's always a neat way to look at things
because you don't get comparative with
[SPEAKER_01]: like our products better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our product, their product was incredible
because they could do dry sift that was
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf stable, that was absolutely aromatic
and rich, full flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They off gas it in the cold for months
before they make the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they get rid of the profiles that we
love most in America, which is gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like it because they think that
it gives you a hangover the next day and
[SPEAKER_01]: makes to groggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they off gas the gas and it reveals all
these subtle fruits and florals that I
[SPEAKER_01]: hadn't experienced in dry sift hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it fits their world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to be too fucked up
because you're walking on the side of a
[SPEAKER_01]: mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until you're until you're in Pakistan,
you realize you're not on a lot of flat
[SPEAKER_01]: ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that shit was living.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were climbing up these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, you got to be kidding me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then these kids come running by us
like goats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made me feel like I was 90 instead
of 60 because the kids are laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just skipping down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just helps you understand,
well, what they want is they want the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits of the cannabis they consume,
but they want to be able to control it in
[SPEAKER_01]: a way that fits their reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was beautiful to see because,
man, you have, you know, you got 500 grams
[SPEAKER_01]: of killer hash to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every village we went,
we got hooked up with somebody that hash
[SPEAKER_01]: friends of the team would meet us at
certain locations and they would show up
[SPEAKER_01]: with hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to hang out with a dude that was a
minor, you know, a mineral company and he
[SPEAKER_01]: had just got back from Morocco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he brought a brick of Moroccan hash
with them that he just hand carried over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're grinding up Moroccan hash and
filling joints and we're wrapping them
[SPEAKER_01]: with snakes of Tira Valley, Pakistan ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a hash smuggish boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've smoked a lot of hash in my
life, but I don't know if I was ever
[SPEAKER_01]: consciously trying to smoke myself
through, you know, 500 grams over a three
[SPEAKER_01]: week period, because that's a lot of
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Undeniably, that's a lot of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredibly impressive and,
you know, a beautiful story.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next question I wanted to ask you was
what sort of plants do you think would
[SPEAKER_00]: cross well with some of the seeds you got
on the Pakistani trip?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, do you think like just as
a general thing, like OG crossed to some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants might be a cool combination
or does anything jump to mind in that
[SPEAKER_00]: respect?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started messing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the Afghani work that I got from
Ghazni and they're they're they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: similar gene pools, but similar regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started messing around with the
males that I was pulling out and I laid
[SPEAKER_01]: them into everything I had just so I could
see the influence on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them lined up better than
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was funny, but the the the disgusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfurs that I was working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't bring that same heat to the
OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went through a bunch of different
plants, but the cherry pie took the took
[SPEAKER_01]: the profile incredibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of shocking because I
didn't expect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur to be minimized by the gas of the
OGs and sour and the chems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I went through a plethora of
them, but it was the cherry pie that
[SPEAKER_01]: turned out to be the most disgusting,
powerful rosin I've smoked in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was almost scary high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, sometimes it's funny,
but sometimes it's just uncomfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: where you just like, whoa, you want to
come down because you are just fired up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's truthfully, that's where I
would start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That plant and I would go into the cherry
pie and I would also look for the same
[SPEAKER_01]: male that I chose in that to go into the
select red lead puck, because if I could
[SPEAKER_01]: add more complexity to that, it'd be
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so and both of those are similar,
like red lead puck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm fascinated by it because it
has a profile that everyone in my house
[SPEAKER_01]: had to listen and talk about this shit for
a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they got to smoke it,
they were like, whoa, I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see why you're so obsessed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a really similar like cherry pie
type bite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cherry pie is mouthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cherry pie done right is incredible and
it makes it superior.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor profile is just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just happen to I get the old
original cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the cut that I have Jackson,
he has an S one of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He found a seed in a bag that he uses in
all of his work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all his cherry work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's louder than the cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like the base cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's just such a perfect plant for
where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my family loves to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for whatever reason, it takes male
pollen and does some interesting shit with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see why it's woven into so many
other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see why cherry pie is, you know,
that's you're you're into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Billions and billions and billions of
dollars of herb is sold every year that
[SPEAKER_01]: have cherry pie in its lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would go there first and mostly
because I'm not looking like if I wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to do something cool, I could go into
something that's polar opposite and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I'm on the thirty four latitude and
I'm in a I'm in a heavy chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go down to like the, you know,
the zero latitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go into a heavy floral,
which would put me into like an African or
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a shame Australia doesn't have
any true land race because your your
[SPEAKER_01]: latitudes in the zeros, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that sent me into Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sent me into if I go up a little bit
higher, like 13, I'm in the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexico that puts us into like Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of those things would cross really
well, which is really the original hybrids
[SPEAKER_01]: that took over North America was they were
taking things that were distinctly
[SPEAKER_01]: unrelated and putting them together and
doing big population work to find the
[SPEAKER_01]: parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's nothing original
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not a derogatory comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to reinvent the wheel every
time you wake up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's nice to say, OK,
they took that and that and put it
[SPEAKER_01]: together and came out with some incredible
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I wanted to see more than that
was I wanted to see it in a chassis that
[SPEAKER_01]: was workable for my area so that I was
already bringing the the the chances of
[SPEAKER_01]: success into a tighter realm of possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I was to want to mess around with
something today, I would take that Oreo
[SPEAKER_01]: cut that's basically bulletproof,
mold proof, grows like a weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it couldn't be a better chassis as
a plant and throw that profile on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I'd have to go through
enough of them to find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you could put the two together,
be an A plus, just like the cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only problem with the cherry pie is
it's got a little bit of mold prone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't like the moisture at the end of
the cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a it's a perk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perps don't like moisture at the end of
the cycle either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I had to say there was one thing I
didn't like about the plant is that it and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad it finishes early because if it
went late, you wouldn't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what a comprehensive answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cherry pie hybrid sounds incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I myself, big massive fan of the
cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of the best strains out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's awesome to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lined up like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an extension of the last question,
you know, I wanted to ask you when,
[SPEAKER_00]: when, when we talk about land race
genetics in general, everyone,
[SPEAKER_00]: generally speaking, except like Afghanis
and Thais, like there's some real fire in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to ask you, what are some of
the other land race or old world genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that you think are really underrepresented
that might have something to offer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I bring this up is
because I noticed you'd put a post up
[SPEAKER_00]: about doing a Cambodian F2 and it sort of
got my brain juices stimulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a killer one too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, was, was, was cool was like,
what made it good for me was that growing
[SPEAKER_01]: up as a kid, I got to see a lot of herb
coming in from around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I left the Rhode Island and
went in the military, I lived in Hawaii in
[SPEAKER_01]: the mid eighties and Hawaii was just a hot
bed of the nastiest weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were raiding all kinds of
boats out at sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to see all the herb coming in
from Asia too, but all, all like original
[SPEAKER_01]: gene stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just left this incredible print in
my mind of profiles and impacts and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: my, it's my foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I spent years after that,
you know, chasing different directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I started hanging out with
Mexican cats, I'm like, Hey, bring me
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds from the grows you guys are doing in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was moving the weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get some of the good seed you're
screwing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would grow them indoor so that
I would be able to experience what it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like to grow these profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as time goes on, I get to travel
the world and look at stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what, what really helped me most more
than anything recently was I got to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamaica and I went out there with the,
the, the PIF crew, which was Joe,
[SPEAKER_01]: the hard way and white boy, Kev about in
New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like the original PIF haze guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were, we were going to do this
project in Massachusetts with the group
[SPEAKER_01]: community gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came up with the idea that we ought
to go to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to go take a look at a project that's
going on out there, which was this
[SPEAKER_01]: preservation project that this guy's
lifetime of collecting land race jeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since it was in Jamaica, you get to
see like a true representation of it in an
[SPEAKER_01]: equatorial climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where he is in Spanish town is the
driest part of the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives you a really interesting
ability to do fuel like varieties in
[SPEAKER_01]: addition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to see some crazy hybrids from
jeans I had provided him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That he got to weave in with some of his
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me, Kev and Joe fly out to Scott family
farms in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we spend the next week out there
really looking at the, the, the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: projects and looking at the varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just epic because it let me
take a look at the Colombian collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: It let me take a look at the Mexican
collections, the, the green apple,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, Acapulco golds were like two puffs
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It literally lit up like a green sour
apple candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your mouth, the Zacatecas purples that
are just ultra perfumey and pungent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had really never played the
Zacatecas and I hadn't had Acapulcos that
[SPEAKER_01]: had fruit flavors either really.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like directions I hadn't
explored.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got into the, he had the Mullenby
madness, which is really a tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of the tie lines were epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a beautiful collection of Laos work
and Cambodian work that he acquired while
[SPEAKER_01]: he was in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Cambodia and Laos, and I had already
gone through a population of his Cambodian
[SPEAKER_01]: three line crossed into a C five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually I have some hanging in my
garage right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just came down a little while ago
because it would make it through the rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I haven't probably a couple of
pounds of that, but I'm going to trim up
[SPEAKER_01]: and then have some really killer C five
Hayes, Cambodian three for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nasty, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I was able to break a little branch off
maybe like two weeks early so that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: just dry it and have it to smoke so I
could just like, I grew it before,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just, let me, let me, let me puff on
this shit and man, it was such a searing,
[SPEAKER_01]: clear, clean high, just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like a good, beautiful,
like electric high, that's not racy or
[SPEAKER_01]: edgy, but just total clarity and energy,
you know, in a controlled way,
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff is money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked the Laos hybrids too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They brought some really interesting lemon
profiles and the high was ripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I messed around with some Zomales
when I was younger, but they were always
[SPEAKER_01]: hybrids and they, they were kind of always
hybridized with things that took the
[SPEAKER_01]: Zomale edge off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to mess around with some real
Zomales that he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call them carrot weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was young said of that carrot
flavor, but holy shit, that, that high was
[SPEAKER_01]: cracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was able to take some of the,
I want to say he took like some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Laos or some of the Cambodian and then
went into a black lime reserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had some of the original black lime
reserve seeds put away in the original box
[SPEAKER_01]: and I sent them to him, you know,
year or so to back to play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to see some of that woven in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you started to see some of the fuel and
the limes brought in with some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: tropicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had a bunch of different Congo work
that he had done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the red Congos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you got to experience some of that
bitey sharp Congolese work.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had done, um, a collection called skunk
by scratch, where he went to the three
[SPEAKER_01]: different locations where skunk is
supposed to come from, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghanistan, Mexico, and Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in those regions brought back the
genes from those regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he recreated his own skunk one,
but from his own source collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really interesting too,
because what he had gathered was choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to see some different edges to
the profile because it wasn't in your
[SPEAKER_01]: typical skunk gene pool, just from same
regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the end of the day, man,
what you got to do is you got to go
[SPEAKER_01]: through as much herb as you can find and
kind of find what you like and what works
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and for me, what I always
try to find is, is things that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'll do a couple of runs indoor
personally for smoke on shit that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: like being outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my LA Kush, if we have a wet fall,
it doesn't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm in a drier, hotter climate,
it kills it or the year happens to be
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more incidentally drier than normal,
but otherwise I run it indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run a bio indoor and I, I get that
product that I want, but from that method,
[SPEAKER_01]: but everything else I sift for myself for
personal uses, is sifted from my yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sifted from my, my personal grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I know some of the things
that are sorted.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I like the Mexican work better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the Mexican lines are
completely on uncredited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that I think the Mexicans in
general get fucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like they, they didn't
contribute to the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, I mean, they were absolutely
flood in America for years and the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: of the products coming out of Michoacan
and O'Hawken and the Zacatecas and
[SPEAKER_01]: Acapulcos and just stunning, stunning
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works in our environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think in a perfect world,
you know, you'd see a lot more of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Mexican work being moved into the system
for California cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd see, you know, the, the,
the Colombian the stuff coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Zemal, the ties being grown in glass
houses down in like central and Southern
[SPEAKER_01]: California where they could have that bomb
your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause our cold gets too cold and the
plants don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't like the cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can handle the moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't handle the cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that, you know, is,
is you, you define where you want to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you go chase those gene pools
that work for you in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an awesome answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are, you, you read my mind and touched
on the Jamaican trip I was going to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: you about, because I noticed you were,
as you mentioned, the Scott family farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: AKA reefer man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a, what a blast from the past to,
to see him pop up down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's, what's the end goal of the project
he's doing there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it to be able to offer some seed stock
or is he growing herb?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he was, he was down there,
you know, Charles is in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's in man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're, you're working in cannabis
for your whole career and you get involved
[SPEAKER_01]: in any large operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns into a freak show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, um, he had some bad
circumstances and he settled there and
[SPEAKER_01]: what he was trying to do was use this
incredible location.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Spanish town location was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kingston is like the, that's the irony of
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kingston is considered like a really rough
area and Spanish town is considered the
[SPEAKER_01]: roughest area of Kingston.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was still way safer and cleaner
than San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody was laughing like I'm from
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't think you're gonna stay
California is a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the climate was ideal and it
allowed him to be able to work a
[SPEAKER_01]: tremendous amount of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he was trying to do is basically,
you know, do his 2023 release and start to
[SPEAKER_01]: hand over the business to his kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he and I knew each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never met Charles in person until
that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just knew each other online because
we're both in the gene game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we chatted a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was talking to the team at
community gardens, Steve and Doug,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we were talking about working together
on a project, I said, Hey, if we got the
[SPEAKER_01]: Hayes guys with us, it would be incredible
to just jump to Jamaica and go spend a
[SPEAKER_01]: week with Charles and go look at all the
foundations of the things that really
[SPEAKER_01]: created the plant that they worked with
solely for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would, and it's for me,
I love working with other people and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting to see their experiences and
understand how they view a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I said, Hey, I don't, and I didn't
know them either.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were all, we all just met on a zoom for
business conference call, but I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to Charles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew the project was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on the computer screen with the two La
Marina boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, Whoa, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this is going to sound crazy,
but the three of us should go to Jamaica
[SPEAKER_01]: and go look at the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get ourselves educated on the
diversity of all these lines at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time next to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the thing is that I've seen these
plants over the course of my life,
[SPEAKER_01]: never in the same room at the same time,
all grown side by side.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, what I think made me
understand OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, is that I probably had 15 different
OGs and I used to run them off side by
[SPEAKER_01]: side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was no question.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were not the same, but everyone was
an OG and it allowed me to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: why is this OG better than this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, or why is this one sold for more money
than this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or why is this one more popular with this
group?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is this one so successful here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I had them all and I ran them all
next to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're running them independently,
you only see that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you put them all in the same room
at the same time and you're segregating
[SPEAKER_01]: the population so you can pay attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're recording it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really make some pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opinions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to go see all this plant material
that he had collected his whole life from
[SPEAKER_01]: around the world and get to hang with them
and listen to him, tell you why he had
[SPEAKER_01]: collected it and why he had worked it and
where he got to this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It let all of us see a part of the
industry that we're not involved in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also for him to see parts of the
industry he's not involved in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allowed for the California and the
New York group to, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from New England, I'm a Rhode
Islander, but I spent, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30, 35 years in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically California is where I've
spent majority of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I know the industry best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that background in California lets me
talk to New York and New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: since they've been there their whole
lives, they can say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can really start to understand what
are the differences in the similarities
[SPEAKER_01]: and consumptive patterns, desires,
cultivation, like all the little details
[SPEAKER_01]: that just you need to understand so that
you're able to pivot intelligently when
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years, you know, a lot of people
do find Reefer Man to be a bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: polarizing guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people have said that,
oh, he never shipped my seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you heard from some people,
they might not have been stoked about your
[SPEAKER_00]: recent trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say to someone who is
critical of, you know, the trip to visit
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the I only knew Charles online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he and I met online and neither one of
us actually knew who the other one was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he I didn't realize I was talking to
Reefer Man, he didn't realize that who I
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we we meet through a friend talking
about genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we realized who each other was,
it was kind of fun, because it allowed him
[SPEAKER_01]: to have somebody that was a weed freak,
that he could kind of share his weed freak
[SPEAKER_01]: shit with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get to enjoy him as a as a as a
person in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I start to find out, you know,
all this backstory of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: let me say, let me say like white
supremacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like, holy shit, man,
you got a wicked backstory.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the whole time I'm speaking to him
online, everything was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And never once did I get any kind of feel
that he was that kind of dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I when I see the problems with
business, I realize that people have
[SPEAKER_01]: issues and the issue with cancer cannabis
is that the whole industry so fucked up
[SPEAKER_01]: that I don't see a single company that
doesn't have about 50 different I hate you
[SPEAKER_01]: because something unhappy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't really know how to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we went out there and hung
out, he explained he goes, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was from like a white supremacist
background, I was raised right wing as a
[SPEAKER_01]: kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, I, you know, I got into
Buddhism, I'm trying to be a better guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what made me believe it was that I
spent that week with his family,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I made his kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his two daughters were the two nicest
girls he could have been around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like balanced, he got three
daughters, but the two of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: I met two of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they couldn't have been any nicer and
and genuine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them had a Jamaican boyfriend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if living in a house, so if you're a
white supremacist, you're definitely not
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing your daughter to have a Jamaican
living in your home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way they all got along was really
pretty beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just realized that, you know,
as nutty as your background may be and as
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy as life may be, you can't have two
daughters that nice that are still
[SPEAKER_01]: sticking with you for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're if you're that fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it just let me see a piece of them
that was solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the piece I focused on because
there's there's, you know, decades of
[SPEAKER_01]: people saying great things about Charles
and then there's decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I started digging in, I said,
Holy shit, you polarize people incredibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, it's it's a
toss up between I love you and I hate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only thing I can do in that kind of
circumstance, unless I try to do in
[SPEAKER_01]: general is just what are we there for?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're there to be explore your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're being gracious enough to let us
explore it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the process, I'll be able to talk
about the trip and get some attention on
[SPEAKER_01]: to the La Marina boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this story gets covered and the story
about them exploring the the the the work
[SPEAKER_01]: and it brings attention to community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seemed like a win win for all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that some of the blowback
on it was like, you know, do you know who
[SPEAKER_01]: he is?
[SPEAKER_01]: He fucked me on some seeds or he has a
past history.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I'd say probably 80 percent
of the comments were really pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: positive, maybe even 85 out of 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, Charles had had a good
run.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're in cannabis long enough and you
try to go legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minute you get into legal cannabis,
you lose control over what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are so erratic in legal
cannabis that, holy shit, if your name's
[SPEAKER_01]: connected to it, man, you better be
careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Charles was nice to us while we were
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he absolutely is a weed freak beyond
belief, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He absolutely loves breeding dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no question about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his memory of the work was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it allowed us to go toward the past
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't have any bad memories of
the trip, but I don't have a bad vibe from
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we haven't spoken in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was having some health issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once people start to struggle and
stuff, I just give you some space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was he was having some health
issues, you know, just personal shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all in all, man, Charles was gracious
and his daughters were really friendly and
[SPEAKER_01]: the trip was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a really positive trip,
you know, and so I say to a Pakistan,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's like, well, what about the
Afghan refugees?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the women?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, OK, I live in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about our refugees?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about our homeless?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about our violence?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I mean, what am I supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell everybody else how to live when we
can't get our own shit straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how am I supposed to fix these
problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: And people like, well, you know,
you're not addressing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, how am I supposed to address it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm being brought in to look at genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got brought into the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least to look at a project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's like, well, what did you do
when you're there for the peace?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what the fuck would you like
me to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not my expertise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how I do peace?
[SPEAKER_01]: I try not to cause anybody any problems
that I don't hit you in the head with a
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking hammer when I'm angry at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's there's only so much you can
do.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main thing is you try to be as
decent as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people are totally out of fucking
control, then you can't be around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like this projects that I have to turn
down because I'm like, yo, you you you
[SPEAKER_01]: burn too many people and I know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't work with you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just you got a bad history,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like you're nice to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get along good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, man, you let everybody around
you on fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't play with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this case, you know, I wasn't doing
business with Charles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were really wanting to explore these
gene worlds that he was digging into so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we were able to come back into the
New England area and bring that flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Courtesy of the La Marina boys,
because they're mythical New York figures
[SPEAKER_01]: in the haze in the haze crowd.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to hear your answer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I definitely can resonate with
love me, hate me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to pick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And choosing love seems like that eruption
to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can certainly appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good to hear you're able to,
you know, give a bit of props to the La
[SPEAKER_00]: Marina boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, some positive can come out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to pivot for a moment and ask you
about something different, which was I
[SPEAKER_00]: want us to talk about autos for a second,
because when we when we had Sean from
[SPEAKER_00]: Flying Lion Research on the show a little
while back, you dropped a comment talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about how, you know, Sean had given you
some seeds when you saw him at one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: conventions recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, what's your thoughts on
autos?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do you think they're going to
play a role in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your experiences being growing them
out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Autos are definitely going to play a role
in the future because they they allow they
[SPEAKER_01]: allow you a couple things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like autos are tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: They offer that the issue with autos is
that they're sensitive root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your soil temperature isn't at par,
they halt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to have warm enough soil,
which is, you know, so most people aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring their soil temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not putting a thermometer into
the soil of the garden saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is my surface temp?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's not right, you can't plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you transplant and you shock them,
you screw it up, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you see an auto put in correctly,
oh, it's an incredible plant because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the the vigor genes have been basically
stroked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they have is this explosive growth
profile in a very rapid period,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they'll fill the world with the
products you need for like lower quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point, I'm sure they're going to
nail an auto that can compete with
[SPEAKER_01]: anything smoke wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, autos are the things you use to
fill your your edible markets,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that you're going to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a concentrate that doesn't require
epicurean traits, I would get it from my
[SPEAKER_01]: autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that if you're doing fields of
autos correctly, they're very cost
[SPEAKER_01]: effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows you to get your good B grade
products to the market at a good,
[SPEAKER_01]: fair price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember, most people are buying
everybody wants a Ferrari.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are buying a Toyota or Honda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no shame in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they make great cars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that your budget dictates that I
have this view and people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get angry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's there's only two customers to me,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't nothing else matters except this
one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's if it's a customer, if it's
someone if it's a patient, million
[SPEAKER_01]: different variations, customer,
then they're coming to buy something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only two that exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those that buy what they want and those
that buy what they can afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those that buy what they want,
the conversation is radically different
[SPEAKER_01]: than those that buy what they can afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I make sure that I try to service both
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 85, 90 percent of the effort is going
to go towards those that buy what they can
[SPEAKER_01]: afford because that's 80 to 90 percent of
the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other 15, 10, 15 percent is they buy
what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your epicurean in upper scale
group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everybody wants to serve them only
because they believe that's where all the
[SPEAKER_01]: success in life is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is they're not always
buying a lot of weed, cocaine,
[SPEAKER_01]: champagne, shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to herb, they're not
herb is a blue collar drug more than
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you when you talk about this stuff,
you have to make sure to me, you always
[SPEAKER_01]: have to have that customer in mind that at
the end of the day, what we want and who
[SPEAKER_01]: cares?
[SPEAKER_01]: What matters is what does the customer
want?
[SPEAKER_01]: The customer would like to have cheaper
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they could grow it using technology
that allows them to get it, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day,
that's a fair market.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're talking a market economy,
the the things that are required are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can enter and exit it well,
and you're there to serve your own best
[SPEAKER_01]: interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as we start to put limits on
that by saying, oh, no, no, that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: fair to us, the small farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to create this special situation
where they don't get to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not that's not a fair market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're asking for concessions and
considerations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no difference than if I said I
wanted to be a monopolist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's also not a fair market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, what we have to address is where
does the majority of people get their
[SPEAKER_01]: weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to get it from easy to grow
commercial sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where does that leave the small
operator to work on Epicurean Lane?
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I know from the you know,
the auto work is that it's only a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of genes that control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're going to able you're going
to be able to see incredible profiles
[SPEAKER_01]: being brought out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they even have ways to create semi
autos, where they're just accelerated in
[SPEAKER_01]: their flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's something to do with the vigor
gene that seems to drag along with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a geneticist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes when I talk about this,
I get geneticists jumping up and down
[SPEAKER_01]: screaming at me online.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not a geneticist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just work with the geneticists.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just help them choose the traits that
sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I helped them say these are the things I
want as a grower, and I never want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're able to say, okay,
then I ask them, so what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: They go, oh, what we have is multiple gene
interactions that make this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're able to trigger these things
and place them within other plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: then what we have is an ability to make
any plant do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I know is that our future will
be extremely technologically advanced than
[SPEAKER_01]: how we grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just know that it's the
inevitability that there is that it will
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's when it takes place, you know,
through the entire state of Nebraska.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when you're cultivating, you know,
10,000 hectare in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when you're doing, you know,
six million acre in Columbia, because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're providing 40% of the earth with its
extract, which is what is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it's all going to take place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just the inevitability.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens right now is everybody's
lumped in the same group.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have commercial, but you can't
have craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're comparative terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're opposite sides of the same piece
of paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without one, you can't have the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have one side of paper because
paper has two sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to have commercial in order for
people to say, you know what, I want
[SPEAKER_01]: craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for people who smoke craft,
they're like, hey, I love smoking craft,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I got to go to a party and I'm going
to go smoke with a bunch of people that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just go, let me go back and grab
some auto pre rolls because it's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: with liquor.
[SPEAKER_01]: After the first two drinks, the best thing
you can do is drink cheap booze because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to know the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're drinking $200 whiskey and now
you're drinking $20 whiskey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was thinking about that the
other night myself, just with some wine I
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to take with me, you know,
you're a hundred percent right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon enough, there'll be fields of July 41
autos and you'll barely be able to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it could be a good thing
for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to quickly loop back you'd
mentioned some Zemail strains a little
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier in the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw on your Instagram, you posted some
photos of some reunion island seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you end up growing those out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anything cool in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just stashed them because those were
from like 24 week open populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I received them and then I
just banked them because I was just,
[SPEAKER_01]: do I really, like I went through this
phase where I went on this haze phase
[SPEAKER_01]: where I was haze obsessed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I spent a lot of time and a
lot of space digging through deep cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really, really have to want to do
that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not casual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you really, you can't fuck up at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're basically, you're dealing with,
they don't like any nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they work off of the bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, if you mess up at all,
you'll curl these things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not able to like really
bring the light down heavily over time and
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain the intensity, they don't finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really hard to control a plant
that wants to be 20 foot indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're chopping it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, try to do this with a
building, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I went on this, I dove,
I went into it and I was looking for the,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the Holy grail of the hazes because
I'd smoked so much Colombian growing up
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was like, I know Colombian and I
was looking for all these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and really, you know, that,
that's the thing is haze tie or haze
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depends who you talk to, but no matter
what they require an incredible amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: effort indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they haven't been like a worked
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you find is that a lot of the
stuff that we consume coming from the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the seed banks, the parental
selection is poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're having to go through,
you know, I went through, we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, a year and a half of
digging through populations, which is 140
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can get, you know, basically two,
two and a quarter runs in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a two year period, you get five runs
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five versus 12 is a radically different
amount, but I had my home garage sparked
[SPEAKER_01]: up and it was tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to do it all in the garage
and work it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I went through population on
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't really that impressed with the
amount of it because what it let me
[SPEAKER_01]: understand was the parental selection had
been done poorly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was talking to Charles,
me and him were rapping about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said the same thing that when he
did his initial selection, he said.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had got so spread out that he had to go
through almost any, at the time he had,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, huge resources spatially.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said he had to go through over 700 to
find the parental stock that he wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what it did is it allowed him to
get selection down to like 10 to 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you could go through 10 to 15 seeds
and find some that was epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, I noticed the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had amassed this collection of these
equatorials from all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went on this crusade to find the
fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I found was OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And OK doesn't justify 140 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the thing with the Zemal was it was
a great gift from someone who went to
[SPEAKER_01]: Zemal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish I had got those seeds before I
went on that Colombian or that Thai dig,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I would be braver.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you realize it's going to be 24
weeks, you're looking at 160 days of
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you bring it down to like 10,
14, you're still in the 120s.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I getting?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes, you know, I just like as
I get older, I said, OK, how about we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't hunt them here?
[SPEAKER_01]: How about we hunt those in Colombia?
[SPEAKER_01]: How about we go hunt these varieties in
their land of origin where they just grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we select the phenotype from that
population versus let me do it indoor in
[SPEAKER_01]: California, because it was just it's just
impractical.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 days is reasonable.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90 days is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like and a lot of plants really
that we pick at nine should really go into
[SPEAKER_01]: that that 11, 12 week period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 90 is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get something to finish in the
90 range, that's stellar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's reasonable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once we get past that, there's got to
be some exceptional reason why,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just because it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different difference, different,
but exceptional.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something where like it's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just straight up know it's worth your
time to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're on the topic of
exceptional, I'm sure you've had a
[SPEAKER_00]: plethora of memorable weed come across the
desk at the nursery over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you recall one or two that jumped to
mind is extremely unique or memorable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last 20 years, what we did is we
destroyed the gene population and we just
[SPEAKER_01]: basically went, you know, we went right
into perp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we go right into Kush and then we
went right into cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we went right into candy gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were all interesting in their own
regard, but like they didn't stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What stood out was like a Mexican that I
grew that was identical to smoke in a
[SPEAKER_01]: Newport cigarette, where if you if you
mess around with menthol, it was menthol
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had I had some seeds that I got from an
old dude in Soham when I got here,
[SPEAKER_01]: like in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was and I meant I missed that
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of them was.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it when it burned in the joint,
it burned so oily, it looked like you had
[SPEAKER_01]: lit a tire up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you smoked it, it was so
devastatingly strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It knocked me out and put me on the couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I woke up and my my my girlfriend was
wiping my face with the wet rag because
[SPEAKER_01]: she thought I was ill or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, oh, you're moaning and you're
shaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm washing your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was cracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, no, I'm just really I like this
stuff was next level power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that like it just stood out because
nothing had that type of nail you to the
[SPEAKER_01]: wall potency, just to a degree that was
frightening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rosin that I made off of that Afghani
sherry pie was absolutely unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took it to a breeder's meeting with a
lot of really well-known people and turn
[SPEAKER_01]: them yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they were just shaken from the
potency of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flavor was excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had that really disgusting cheese like
aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So high in methyl butyric acid and heavy,
heavy sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the mouth was really interesting,
but the potency was crippling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a skunk that kind of reminded me of
a sour diesel in the way it stats.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was the most noxious piss skunk in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got it from a friend of mine,
Brian, and his buddy, his his buddy's dad
[SPEAKER_01]: was the head of the drug task force in the
triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dad brought home a plant to the
son and said, on all the years we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: raiding weed, this is the best weed I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I stole a plant for you and gave it to
his son.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the son shares it with Brian and
then Brian shares it with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that shit was supernatural.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the one plant that I lost in a
raid that I, of all plants I've ever lost
[SPEAKER_01]: in raids or boss or any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one I miss the most because it
was so exceptional in the mouth,
[SPEAKER_01]: the nose, the weight, the resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single part of the plant looked like
a marble, but connected in a tightly dense
[SPEAKER_01]: cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you almost had no leaves on it
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you broke it apart, each piece
got beautiful sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the coloration was consistent
throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, it had an odor that was so loud
that when I opened up the car door at the
[SPEAKER_01]: football game, I was at the Oakland Rays,
the door opened up, the smell blew out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blew through the parking lot,
hundreds of yards, two cops turned their
[SPEAKER_01]: heads and ran at the car and arrested me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, they were out of view when I
opened the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm talking like a hundred,
like football field away that there was
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing that was more volatile than that
shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and the one that I saw in
Pakistan was exceptional.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the, the Zakatakis work that
Charles had in Jamaica was exceptional.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an incredible odor, like just
absolutely pungent, stunning, unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that, you know, when you're
talking about really exceptional
[SPEAKER_01]: standouts, they, they don't fit into any
category of today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mean like categories of
perception that I lay them out as,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they don't, they're, they're,
they're just not present.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not working with those extreme ends
of the gene pool right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with really more consistent
populations, safe, and distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't like risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So distribution doesn't favor plants that
are outliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want things that this is what the
market wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it, it, it discourages in ingenuity
and discovers innovation and it inhibits
[SPEAKER_01]: your, your creativity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't explore the weird edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what else is some sexy shit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked the, the Pam Anderson work
from Tyler family trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of his Pam, Pam Anderson is this,
this line that he picked up in LA,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, decades ago, and he named it
after Pam Anderson, the, the actress,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that stuff, there's some sweat
inducing cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's like a dirty sock and a funky
bag of cheese, but it puts a mouth on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just absolutely stupendous with a
rip and high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love all the, the, the, the Pam work
that he's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he shared it with Nick Rizdan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rizdan opened up those populations and put
into a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, that's pretty unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is really, really unique that
just stands out?
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't taste like anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a cheese out of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to, I don't remember the
Paisley farms did it, but it was a Ross
[SPEAKER_01]: and I can't remember who bred it,
but it was so indistinguishable from like
[SPEAKER_01]: Parmesan cheese that I had my girl close
her eyes and I held the Parmesan cheese up
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Ross and I went back and forth and
she couldn't tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, it was that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, that really stood out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What really caught me recently to,
um, shit, that's really all the weird
[SPEAKER_01]: standouts, you know, like, I mean,
you always remember the first time you
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke OG, you know, I, I love LA pure Kush
that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, I think that that can stand next
to any herb, like period.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got such a mouth on it, such a,
it's such a complete flavor all the way to
[SPEAKER_01]: the roach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nobody, everybody I shared the
plant with, like the crew I roll with
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone that got a, got a cut of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's their go-to smoke because no
matter what they're going to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: effect they want from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I still get little text messages
and messages saying, man, I love you bro
[SPEAKER_01]: for giving me that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave it to him fucking forever ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, are you high as fuck right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, like it's stuff like
that, that there's just these little
[SPEAKER_01]: things that just differentiate it from the
norm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't have to be a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just has to be a point or two
different, but a different enough to where
[SPEAKER_01]: it just sticks in your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could definitely relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain ones that just leave such
a lasting memory for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We normally ask this question sort of at
the start of the episode, but we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to switch it up today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to ask it basically at the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my neighborhood was a crime zone,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And my, my, one of my buddy's dad was a
crooked cop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was always robbing all the
people he was arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you went to his house and you
went into his dad's room, when he was at
[SPEAKER_01]: work, there was all kinds of stolen goods
on his bureau and guns and knives and
[SPEAKER_01]: shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was collecting from people and drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my buddy Kenny had access to the
herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old man was jacking from people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this would have been between the
summer of a sixth grade and seventh grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm seeing some of my older friends
that tell me, man, I've been smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, I want to try some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Kenny's like, man, I'm going to go
to my dad's room and score some weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he scores some weed and he scores a
pipe too.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of these big old like Sherlock's,
but all made out of metal parts,
[SPEAKER_01]: all like, you know, plumbing fixtures and
shit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The old school pipes from the seventies,
cause this would have been 78.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went up on the roof of my house and
we were chilling and we light it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I'm puffing it, a seed explodes and
takes off in the air, just as this cop car
[SPEAKER_01]: drives by my home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were all sitting there laughing
like, did he see it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did he see it?
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I know he's going to see a seed
pop, but you were so self-conscious that
[SPEAKER_01]: you were smoking weed and that there was
police nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a little bit of a buzz from it,
but the next, maybe a day or two later,
[SPEAKER_01]: he came by again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this time we took my garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a big garage and we hung a strobe
light up on the ceiling of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all got our bicycles in there and
turn the lights off and turn the strobes
[SPEAKER_01]: on and we smoked and we were doing kind of
like cage death riding, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: zooming by each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll never forget that shit because
that's when I was high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was just like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just kind of went from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was so much herb around because all
the people that I was around were all
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was never a shortage of grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And soon, you know, you get into the game
a little bit and you start meeting the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are trafficking it and they're
helping you kind of get an education on
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they're like, not just selling you
weed, they're like, you're getting touched
[SPEAKER_01]: the bail and they're helping you
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this Columbia is pretty good,
but we usually get something in later in
[SPEAKER_01]: the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, yeah, when that comes
in, I'll go buy your house and grab you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you stash some money so that
when it comes time, you can score the
[SPEAKER_01]: really good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these dealers would help me
understand batch quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when really good shit popped out,
they would combine and grab me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd get to see what like they
considered premium time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a premium Colombian or premium
Lebanese hash or premium Moroccan hash or
[SPEAKER_01]: premium Afghani hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just got this killer education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was all, you know, prior to 83,
83 is when I caught my first case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from 78 to 83, that five year period
was this incredible education.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from 12 to, you know, basically like 12
to 17, I was, I was getting a fantastic
[SPEAKER_01]: education in the diversity herb and still
getting really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you're a kid then,
man, you're just getting lit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So jealous.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like an awesome introductory
into a lifelong passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it sort of evolve from there to
say when you had your first grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: I started growing in 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started smoking in 78.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get into a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a neighbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a brown thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I always tell people that
you can, you can, you can learn to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: good cultivator when you learn to listen
to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't have a background in,
in listening to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friend was just more intuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my buddy bounce, uh, took on the
growing end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a location in my grandmother's
yard that we could grow in and they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know it, but in the backyard, there was a,
there was a spot where no one knew that I,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I could hide plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we used to stash the plants there
and grow them in my grandmother's yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just awesome because everything
I touched, I was killing, but I could help
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary and Gary was, uh, gentle with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started to develop a micro skill
and I said, well, shit, I might as well
[SPEAKER_01]: spark up big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I filled the whole yard of my,
my real house in 83 and got caught by the
[SPEAKER_01]: cops and got dragged out of high school in
handcuffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't grow again until 89 when I
get out of the military.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the day I get out of the service
and in the, in uniform using the
[SPEAKER_01]: government vehicle, I picked up all my
grow, lights in Berkeley and sparked up in
[SPEAKER_01]: 89.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in Oakland, but the growth stall
was in Berkeley, Berkeley into the
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sparked up and I never stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the first cultivation,
you know, was 80, uh, three years of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and then two years of not growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then into the military where I was
around weed constantly and smoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were shows in the coast guard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were raiding drugs everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was looking at as much herb as
anybody on planet earth and living in
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exposed me to, you know, it's funny,
you go to the service, trying to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like, I'm going to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soon as I get to the Island, I hook up
with cats that are smoking fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next thing I know I'm smoking with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, holy shit, I can't stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was loving it because the Hawaiian
was just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I moved to San Francisco in,
you know, in, in, uh, the late eighties
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm in the Bay area and it's a,
it's a smorgasbord of weed too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, no matter where I go,
I'm swimming in weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a story that really prompted
me to go back into it professionally,
[SPEAKER_01]: but bottom line was it just, it was always
around me and I just seemed to feel
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted, I wanted to explore that
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just so curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just felt so uneducated and I just knew
that herb was so massive and big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew I only knew so little.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, if I could just apply
myself, maybe one day, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll understand this complex thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it was a hidden secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was no real info then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was, it was, you know,
the underground now it's, it's radically
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's better in that regard
because regular people shouldn't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: go through so that many hoops to get an
education in cannabis use and cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was almost cultish at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you were, you were
cautious.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wasn't no outlaw shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were, when you went to criminal court,
when I got dragged out of high school and
[SPEAKER_01]: handcuffs, I didn't go to, to outlaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Court.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to criminal court.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of prior guests have commented
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was really hard to find info
and people very tight knit about who they
[SPEAKER_00]: disclose that they're a grower to and
sharing information, even the next level
[SPEAKER_00]: of trust up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm curious though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm sure you grew for some time
and then eventually you decided to start
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderland nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, where did the idea first come from
to start that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was already doing nursery work for
years before I did Wonderland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderland is after I worked at Humble
Patient Resource Center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I worked at Humble Patient
Resource Center, I was doing commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery work for the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning that other like large scale
growers were accessing genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I had done is I had, I was a good
operation builder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And years earlier, I had so many
operations running my self that I was able
[SPEAKER_01]: to do using the, I had to go to adult ed
to learn how to use a spreadsheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was in the, you know, mid nineties
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was able to kind of crack the code
on yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to figure out the variables
that you had to adjust to make the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really modern day crop steering,
but I was, it was even more profound
[SPEAKER_01]: because you were having to actually steer
an operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no data.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nobody to copy and follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the standard standards were pound to
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I said, I just think that that's
just so under producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started to really figure out what it
was that allows you to get higher yields
[SPEAKER_01]: and maintain quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I cracked it, I went from pound
to light into two, and then I went up to
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like, you know, two 14,
two 13s, but two and a half all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So up to two thousands, I was getting five
pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in the nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it instantly made me attractive to work
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: For other cultivators that wanted to do
things, cause they were like, whoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: off of a single table, you know,
two tables, you pull in 10 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So four lights is coming out to like,
you know, 40 grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, how the fuck are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you make it 40,000 out of a bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I said, well, pay me to build you a
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would build them a room, but in order
for the room to work, I had to put in my
[SPEAKER_01]: system and my jeans so that I could repeat
the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I started finding was that people
didn't like to do cloning or do mothers
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was too problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a lot easier just to run a cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after I built the operation,
they said, Hey, you know, would you
[SPEAKER_01]: provide the clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started doing clonal work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next thing you know, I mean,
I'm just pumping clones out like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was doing way more clonal production
than I ever was cannabis production at
[SPEAKER_01]: that stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my career, you know, into the two
thousands, because I was just skilled at
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I was willing to take the risk
on the plant counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was able to generate, you know,
an ungodly sum of money from doing plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people you deal with are different
than buyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only dealing with growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and they're, they're, they're coming
in to buy the product they need to make
[SPEAKER_01]: their money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where you would search yourself into
the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Changes the relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I got into the, the operation in
Arcata, and I took over cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: director of that operation, I said,
Hey, I let all the people know that when
[SPEAKER_01]: my prior clients, that if you went and got
a two 15, you could drive down to Arcata
[SPEAKER_01]: and legally buy plants from me and return
with them with the script and they would
[SPEAKER_01]: be protected up to a certain number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it exploded that company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it absolutely financially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Changed the direction of that business
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the owner and I ended up having
conflict over direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a bummer too, because I was happy
there, but some people just want to stay
[SPEAKER_01]: in one situation, their entire existence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, what I know is that time can't
be held still.
[SPEAKER_01]: That no matter what you're doing,
you can't hold it this way forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to adjust and change with the
changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around you, or eventually you become a
dinosaur and you become extinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she and I had different views.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I left the company and I lit up
wonderland and wonderland was funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause everyone was like, there's no way
you're going to be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no one who's ever done a year
round nursery at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never been done before, but I knew
that if I mined the whole state of
[SPEAKER_01]: California, it certainly could be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I light this place up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we go after the population of
California where I'm swooping through
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhoods all over Southern Cal,
Central Cal, Northern Cal, Eastern Cal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't care who's in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allowed us to be able to just
absolutely step up really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we were trying to do was put
really, really good genes into the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good genes mean genes that when you
grew them out, you could sell the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, what we had issues
with was we would, we were also same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: as I understood that the world was
changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, listen, we didn't use any
toxic shit at, at, at the HPRC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, and I don't want to use any
toxic shit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have to start learning
really how to do organic pest control.
[SPEAKER_01]: How, like, because the future I knew was
not going to allow you to use pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and fungicides that are, aren't
allowed for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I'm doing my homework on potential
problems, we will face down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had done all this research fucking
decades ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, we got a problem with the tools
we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was a learning process too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why when I see people like
someone gets some shit for doing something
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong, I'm like, you know, if you're
first, you're going to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, are you still
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're still here, you had to have
figured out what you did wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Wonderland for me, it allowed me to
understand biological pest control.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a way that is critical for today's
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it lets me work with my own crops at
the farm in a radically different manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm grateful for the experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the fact that we took so much
incredible material I had collected over
[SPEAKER_01]: decades and just basically flooded the
system with it so that these genes made
[SPEAKER_01]: people's lives better financially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it funded all the charity programs we
were able to do at Wonderland.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was this, it was a really magic
moment where in life, it's rare that you
[SPEAKER_01]: get to do philanthropical work at the same
time you're doing work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And medical cannabis kind of was that
where I got to be part of medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, where the people who were ill
and having problems, we just covered your
[SPEAKER_01]: shit for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people who were making money,
we were making money with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm making sure that the markets that
you're approaching, I'm giving you the
[SPEAKER_01]: right plants for those markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I would do all the marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would do market research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would figure out what was hot in every
major city across the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would acquire the plants that
needed to fill those holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you came into me and you told me,
hey, I moved weed to Atlanta, I would know
[SPEAKER_01]: what was hot in Atlanta.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I would set you up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it did is it allowed you to
instantly be able to hit your target
[SPEAKER_01]: markets at speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instantly you were recovering your
money and coming back quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allowed me to be able to work with
all these farmers and develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more they bought, the bigger I got,
the better I did my homework, the more
[SPEAKER_01]: money they made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Wonderland was really almost like a
brain trust more than it was a nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was people didn't really come in to buy
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came in to ask me, what should I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would then sell them the clone
that would fit the need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it made it this really interesting
proactive relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also did stuff that other people
wouldn't do where I lived.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in Oakland for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so most of my partners that I rolled
with weren't white.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I didn't have an issue of going
down to Oakland and dealing with people
[SPEAKER_01]: that weren't white.
[SPEAKER_01]: All my partners that I rolled up in
Humboldt were basically Samoan and Tongan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, being around people that were
Polly was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had done work with Mexicans for years,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to go work with the
Mexicans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the Bulgarians and the Ukrainians
and all the Russian groups started coming
[SPEAKER_01]: into the area, I understood what they were
seeking, which was quality product that
[SPEAKER_01]: would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I approached them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of just kind of focusing only
on the typical cannabis cultivator,
[SPEAKER_01]: I went after the ones that I had spent my
life around, people that have to cultivate
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's where the money's coming
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I would do is I would create my
menus in different languages, Hmong,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Laotian, Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Ukrainian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would have them translated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would have my partner,
Kimo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would identify where all the
supermarkets and ethnic food stores in
[SPEAKER_01]: each one of the areas were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would have them go there and talk to
those people and say, hey, is it OK if we
[SPEAKER_01]: put this up in your store?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I did is I went after the
target populations where they lived around
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gave them the menus in their own
language.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I put it in places where they would
see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just allowed me to get a reach that
was just wicked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the cannabis industry turned
upside down, I got really fortunate
[SPEAKER_01]: because when they started changing all the
zoning, they changed the zoning of my
[SPEAKER_01]: operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Wonderland no longer had an ability to
cultivate at that location.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people said, hey, we would love
to have you come over and work with us and
be part of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We partners on an operation here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's how I got into the one log.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Cookies approached us to do the
nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then step by step, we ended up
becoming their entire research and
[SPEAKER_01]: development facility for that entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the work I did in Wonderland,
it just put me into a position where
[SPEAKER_01]: people realized that you were seeing
something others weren't because you were
[SPEAKER_01]: moving plants at a pace no one was with
really no staff to do sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just that I was doing all this work
on my own because I understood that I just
[SPEAKER_01]: need to learn this as a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I make you money, we should make money
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm filling your pockets with cash,
it's rare that you don't come back and
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Business is business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powerful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what a really unique and organic sort
of progression you just described there to
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately have the various facilities you
operate in today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really inspiring the development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few of our Patreon fans
submitted questions before we get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: final five questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one, I'm just going to quickly run
by our first listener says, can you ask
[SPEAKER_00]: Kev, has he done any work with any CBD,
CBG or any of the alternative varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, what does he find to be the
most medicinal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny, but like some of the first CBD
work ever done in the United States came
[SPEAKER_01]: out of my original shop and I didn't do
the breeding of the development on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just was, I was the one who listened to
the person talk about what was potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: possible and said, okay, I'll dedicate
floor space and people to the op.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where ACDC came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ACDC and it was from Courtney.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was Wade Lowder who did Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was Ringo who did Ringo's
gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was all simultaneously at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been like a round,
you know, 208, 209.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of that work resulted in this
massive development of CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I had done was I open sourced it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started flooding the market with all
these CBD cuts because what we realized
[SPEAKER_01]: was non-psychoactive cannabis would
transform the public perception of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're no longer feeling pain
from your arthritis in your hands from a
[SPEAKER_01]: rub cream, then maybe you'll have some
compassion for someone who needs to smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis because they're depressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my theory was if we shared the
genes in this way, it would absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: infiltrate the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I was known for years for just
releasing millions of dollars of free
[SPEAKER_01]: clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, really hundreds and hundreds of
thousands of plants to groups all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world of CBD genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I think is that if you're working
with CBD, I think some of the mixed ratios
[SPEAKER_01]: like one to ones, two to ones are ideal
because when we, it depends on the
[SPEAKER_01]: individual, but say you're a normal
cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have some CBD woven in,
it balances out the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like when you really look at land
raised populations, they're not all pure
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're definitely mixed cannabinoids
because they're not steering towards a
[SPEAKER_01]: singular molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of it, what you have is a
better synergy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that the best thing you
could do is, you know, go into some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these modern hemp varieties and use them
as a platform to bring in more THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get to a 12, 12, 13,
15, something in that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you'll have is you'll have the
best effects of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on a lot of these other cannabinoids,
that's a tough one because really I don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't try to chase cannabinoid
du jour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because really that's a molecular basket
hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you have to be really using
labs to do so much of the driving and the
[SPEAKER_01]: work towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like I can work with you on a
project to do it by helping you choose
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I want is I want cannabis that I
like to consume for the reasons I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I'm chasing something,
I have to kind of have a desire to touch
[SPEAKER_01]: it and play with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so THC molecule is one I really seem
to like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like it woven in with some CBD,
but I didn't go after the CBCs,
[SPEAKER_01]: the CBGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a plant that's got some THCP in it
at, you know, detectable levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm fascinated by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there's enough there to be
able to actually steer towards the
[SPEAKER_01]: direction, but THCP is a molecule that is
like 30 times stronger than THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it, to me, it's one of the things
that affect the longevity of high and just
[SPEAKER_01]: the overall, how much you need in
titration to get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty fascinated by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of the THCV work that's being
done right now is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to consume some THCV herb grown
by a brand called Pure Beauty out of LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a woman owned living soil
indoor op.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never met any of the team,
but they sent me some of the products so
[SPEAKER_01]: that I could do an essay on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was astounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just straight crushed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Pure Beauty girls are throwing down
some straight heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that THCV was fascinating because you
got this unbelievably effective uplifting
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you came down, you didn't crash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it had a really interesting side
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you weren't hungry afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't go through the munchy cycle,
but like you, it wasn't that you weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could eat dinner, but you didn't eat
dinner twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, with where to me, if I'm smoking
BHO, I have to be careful because I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to not just eat the pizza on my
plate, but I'm going to eat the pizza in
[SPEAKER_01]: the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: THCV didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the mix, I think the novel
cannabinoids are fascinating, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: for the average individual, a one to one,
a two to one is just something wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've certainly found a one to one is sort
of that sweet spot for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can hugely relate to what you just
said there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got another good one from one of
the listeners who says, I saw that photo
[SPEAKER_00]: of the huge ball of the Roberts Creek
Congo hash on his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear any hash making tips for
making hash from like low yielding,
[SPEAKER_00]: but special plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the process of hash is pretty
well laid out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you have to do when you work with
plants that just don't produce is
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not for commercial purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I made that ball of that Roberts
Creek Congo hash, I laughed and I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee there's no bigger ball of this
shit in the country at this point right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, because nobody would waste that much
weed to make that much hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got some right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still got a piece of a left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have a piece of it left right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little, little tiny nugget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years old now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was smoking it the other night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got destroyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to be able to like make
those decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the situation is it's really difficult
if you're doing it indoor and you pay an
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity on that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, you know, it's different that I
could do the Roberts Creek outside and I
[SPEAKER_01]: could get a plant that could throw me
three pounds so that I could basically get
[SPEAKER_01]: a golf ball of hash off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, you talk in yields that
are just non-existent in the wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew that when I went into it,
but I just wanted to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to say, Hey, what happens when
you don't care about return?
[SPEAKER_01]: What you care about is the quality of the
return.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Roberts Creek Congo hash was
excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still love smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only got that little piece left.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I probably got like what maybe
two or three grams left.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, it was just grabbed you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it didn't lift it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it was fresh, the high was way more
like heady as it started to mature and
[SPEAKER_01]: really polymerize.
[SPEAKER_01]: The effect became way more pronounced and
profound where you felt it in your body
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two-year-old Congo hash is still
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was two years ago that I did that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you just have to be able to
make it, you know, work for you and don't
[SPEAKER_01]: be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you have an outdoor patch
next year, same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to do, I got one of my red lead
plants is low yielding, but the profile is
[SPEAKER_01]: so attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that'll break off well that
it'd be worth me doing my whole medical
[SPEAKER_01]: garden of just that to wash and then grow
my six plants for my flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just think that at the end of the
day, if you're not looking at commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: constraints and you're a consumer,
who gives a shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally got to follow the passion and the
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A question we end up asking most guests on
the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had to take a guess, what do you
think is the genetics behind the legendary
[SPEAKER_00]: ChemDog 91?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the chem lines, I remember I was
out there in Peonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was out there in Crested Butte area of
Colorado where all that comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, I was there around 92,
93.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my partner was out there and it was
funny because he was like heavy because I
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked some weed here that destroyed any
of the pot I ever smoked in my entire
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, this area is the hot bed of
Colorado for killer weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was I just talked to somebody
that it was they were trying to chase down
[SPEAKER_01]: what was the parental stock of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, we just know
basically where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know it came out of that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do not know the lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can say it's it's got to be a
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has to have some form of something
broadleaf and something narrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the growth characteristics,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like on a morphological level,
you can see traits that are explosive in
[SPEAKER_01]: growth on the 91, which only really apply
to plants that have to outgrow everything
[SPEAKER_01]: around it and the surrounding vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has a profile that is distinctly
Afghani Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not sure we'll ever really know
the true origins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe genetic testing will get a little
more info at some point, but might just
[SPEAKER_00]: need to accept that we'll never fully
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another good one from one of the
listeners who said, I got a pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from the 2020 Durand line of the Ghazni.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of expressions did you get from
your hunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can they hope to find themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: I found two really distinct profiles,
both male and female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of neat because it made it
pretty easy to make your choices.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I found was, you know,
green and purple and purple was more open
[SPEAKER_01]: branching kind of umbrella shaped
pomegranate, nut paste, floral,
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the green was more pole like
chunky with just a fruity ferociously
[SPEAKER_01]: noxious sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I did all my hybridization
work, I went with the sulfur because
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody was going fruit and sweet and I
was kind of sick of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I wanted was some, you know,
really funky, nasty, deep penetrating
[SPEAKER_01]: odors, aromas and highs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where when I did that,
that project that took the male I chose
[SPEAKER_01]: that I made those plants with or one of
them, there was multiple males in that,
[SPEAKER_01]: in that release.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one that I kept for myself,
that's the one that I went into all the
[SPEAKER_01]: fuels and the cherry pie and pulled out
that cherry pie plant that was absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: A plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had my son's friend come by and
fresh freeze it and then process it and
[SPEAKER_01]: then rosin it for me so that I'd have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't do rosin, I don't press
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wanted someone that could go
through the process and give me a dabble
[SPEAKER_01]: product that I could take to this event so
that this is the product I wanted to show
[SPEAKER_01]: people that was possible when we take some
of these lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so attractive that the lead
breeder of ROA, Adam, got excited by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up giving him some seeds so
that he could go play with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did a huge selection of it this
year to see how it worked out for them at
[SPEAKER_01]: their operation because he had never
smelled a profile like that in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just super attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, all I really
wanted to have people do was be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: say, hey, this reflects seed stock from
Gosney.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, you know, Indian land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: That put it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all I did was clean up the population
to get rid of the intersex on an indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: sips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran it outdoor, took the ones from the
output, them in the ones that went
[SPEAKER_01]: intersex, I called.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we used as the population
to make that F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have two directions, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It broke up really, really clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love to go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I will when I get a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go back and I'll do the purple
pomegranate with the nut paste because
[SPEAKER_01]: that was super exotic, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was bored with all, you know,
you got to go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably did that like three or four
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was just bored with all the candy
gas shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I said, look, I want some I want
some really deep funk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went and deep funked it for a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, maybe I wouldn't mind going back
into some of the florals and fruits,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not from the typical gene pools.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they do a preservation,
make sure you put the males and the
[SPEAKER_01]: females together to get the assortment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be able to keep a good cluster
of the genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then choose males that you can play
with to find out their impact on the
[SPEAKER_01]: females you want to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're able to do hybridization,
bring the qualities forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: The qualities that got brought forward to
I noticed was incredible change in water
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants decreased water consumption
dramatically, which was one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_01]: really why I wanted to mess around with
some of that work, because we were in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of this horrific drought in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, if I could just put
some better water efficiency on some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants, it would just be a lot
easier for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not having to go through so much
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the trials, I just noticed that all
of those hybrids I did all watered at,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I would say twice as,
you know, double the infrequency,
[SPEAKER_01]: but probably like 0.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: So extremely water effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome to hear some really cool
observations there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, hopefully I'll can find
some cool stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one last fan submitted one before
our final five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cool one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never asked our guests before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm keen to see what you think on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, what's the hardest part
about being cannabis famous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get stopped a lot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find people respect your time,
generally speaking?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do get stopped a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's weird because I never expected to
be famous in a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't really the desire as much as
I was desiring to be recognized for the
[SPEAKER_01]: work I had done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ended up just becoming featured on
media enough times that all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: you kind of become comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because you're not desiring that
position, you understand that the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that are listening are not really there to
listen to me as much as they're listening
[SPEAKER_01]: to what's coming out of my mouth in terms
of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I know is that I try to provide
information to the public that has value
[SPEAKER_01]: and I try to be approachable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hard part is that in real life,
it's hard to be able to give that much
[SPEAKER_01]: time to that many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you have to do is you got to
kind of create like parameters where
[SPEAKER_01]: people reach out to you and they're
reaching out to you seven times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, look, I don't talk to my
own kids this often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you just maybe not hit me up every
50 minutes and we'll probably be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a better long term friendship.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I do is I try to create some
separation of barriers, but not remove you
[SPEAKER_01]: from the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you approach me and you polite,
man, I'm always down to sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want, if you want to lay out your
whole business plan to me and I have to go
[SPEAKER_01]: spend six hours of like trying to sort
through your shit, I'm like, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're asking me a question and you
just want to bounce an idea for somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're able to like be polite in the
way you approach me, it's rare that I
[SPEAKER_01]: won't sit down and try to take the time
because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: my desire in real life was to do well and
to see people around me do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't trying to do well alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that when you behave that
way, you end up having a better life
[SPEAKER_01]: period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your life is richer because you're around
people trying to do positive shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because you're being nice doesn't
mean you're stupid or you're a sucker
[SPEAKER_01]: because you know the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, it's about the approach
where you don't have to give me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it a verbal blow job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need a verbal blow job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just need you to treat me like anybody
else you meet and just be polite and
[SPEAKER_01]: approach me in a way that's approachable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can do that, then we can begin
a conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, that's why I make myself so
available at all the conferences I attend,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the different events I go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what I know is that I get to see
so much of the cannabis world that if I
[SPEAKER_01]: can provide little tidbits of info to
people that are trying to figure something
[SPEAKER_01]: out and find a world for them,
maybe it changes how they approach people
[SPEAKER_01]: in their future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if we behave this way, then you'll
behave this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the same thing with me giving
the genes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I helped all these people that it was
funny because when I was doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody was like, you're heretic,
you're helping out nobodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm like, yeah, but they're nobody to
you, but they're decent people to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to have any value to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not seeing it as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I give them this cut and they use
their own skills and effort to take it
[SPEAKER_01]: further, and it really well could change
their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll change it financially for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what happens is I didn't realize
that I was developing a future of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go 15 years into the future and
you got people hitting you up and they
[SPEAKER_01]: were like, hey, you know, when I was 16,
17, you helped me change my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in my mid thirties and I'm running a
monstrous operation in another country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to reach out to you to
let you know that if it wasn't for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never got to thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now that, you know, I can find you
publicly, I can say thank you for being
[SPEAKER_01]: good to me when no one else was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's emotional because you're not
thinking about it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just trying to be decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the Louis XIII cut,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the Louis XIII cut because some old
lady had a bad time and I helped her out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she knows what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she comes to my office and she brings
the phone and says, here, my family wants
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was her Armenian in-laws that owned
the Louis XIII cut down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In LA that were making all the money on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cut was hotter than a firecracker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they drove all the way from LA to
Humboldt to bring me five clones to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: here, these are the most valuable OG
clones in the connection right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is the number one cut in the
game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's five cuts for you for helping our
mother-in-law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had no idea that mother-in-law was
connected to these, these hustlers from
[SPEAKER_01]: LA, but it was just a good deed for an old
lady that needed some help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that, you know,
for me and my, and it's almost like an
[SPEAKER_01]: innocent world, but like I came from a
different background, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was rough.
[SPEAKER_01]: A nicer life is never bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you, when you, when you decent
to people, it allows you a radically
[SPEAKER_01]: different existence and being well-known
in something is never bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as when people meet you,
you're the same person that they,
[SPEAKER_01]: they see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for some people it's not good
because they're like, well, you a smart
[SPEAKER_01]: ass in real life and on the net,
but for most it's good because I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, what I want to
see is I want to see cultivators around
[SPEAKER_01]: the world in a, in a, in a cohesive
collaborative cluster that lets us help
[SPEAKER_01]: shape the future that we'll all have to
deal with when we're old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I've been saying for
decades, I'm just a tiny link in a chain
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going on forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to be a good link.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you want to link up with me,
you can, and if you don't, you can let go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good, but being, being exposed as
a gift because it allows you to really be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to do some incredible things you
can't do if you're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an awesome take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like you, you know,
make yourself available to people,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really generous of you with,
you know, your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's limited on to our final five
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick fire questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one I want to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the single most memorable
experience you've had with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this doesn't have to be like the
strongest Nug or the most insane dab,
[SPEAKER_00]: just whatever is the most memorable for
whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got, I got the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked some weed from Panipé.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working out in Micronesia and I
smoked some weed and I got so high that I
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't navigate the off ramp on the
freeway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just drove around the island for
hours until I came down because every time
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to the on ramp, it was too
technically difficult for me to navigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just did another loop around the
island and I was just praying that I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't run out of gas because there was no
way that I could navigate this off ramp
[SPEAKER_01]: until I came down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the best ones, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
what's a strain where everyone around you
[SPEAKER_00]: really hyped about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's telling you it's going to be
the best thing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You finally try it yourself and you're
sort of like, Oh, is this it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would have been Purple Punch
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Purple Punch first came out,
everybody was hyping the living hell out
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were like, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was the most hype strain I've
seen in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just really gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top 10 visual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who won the flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's one of the top contenders
we do here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one is I'm going to drop you off on a
desert island.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got infinite resources and you can
take three strains or packs of seeds with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What three things are you going to take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to take, I'd have to take three
packs of seeds because if I'm on a desert
[SPEAKER_01]: island, I probably don't have a nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would, I would want to work with
something in that LAPK range because I
[SPEAKER_01]: need that type of profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to have something that was in
the, the, the Mexican groups like that
[SPEAKER_01]: Zacatacas or the Acapulco, just because
the high is just so interesting and the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor is so rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love like a killer Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that, that super cerebral high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that really back in the day,
then ties change flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like for me, all the time we consumed,
you know, in the eighties, when people say
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolate time, I don't know if it's color
or not, but like the flavor was sure
[SPEAKER_01]: chocolatey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the high was absolutely riveting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd go like a good Mexican collection,
something out of Asia Thai.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Thai flavors are better than Laos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Cambodians, the Vietnamese are
a little stronger, but I think the Thai is
[SPEAKER_01]: more balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the, the, a self LAPK,
but I want a self.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would need to have male, female
populations, all three so that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: play with it for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't feel like, um, if anything
happened, I'd be screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked that really balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good little spread there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So similar, but different question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm forcing you to start a seed company
tomorrow and you can only start it with
[SPEAKER_00]: one pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What pack of seeds would you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question for me,
myself, or for the public for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the public, like, as in you can
give two answers, one for each.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess if I, I mean, because I'm so
obsessed with that red lab puck right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'd have to be that because that's what I
did is I took those seeds and I chased it
[SPEAKER_01]: down and I'm thrown out, you know,
lines for public sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be for me, for the general
public, I would say gases returning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you're seeing like the,
the hunger come back and I would go into
[SPEAKER_01]: something from like, like I would say,
you know, Gabe Ruth's work is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh from, um, Regen has got some good
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rizdan has got some good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tyler Family Tree has got some good,
good fuel work where he does some dog
[SPEAKER_01]: walker SFVs that are just ferocious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say if you went into any of those
groups right there, you know, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: always Gene, Gene's always got some really
killer shit, but there's some guys that
[SPEAKER_01]: have some really nice work that aren't as
known.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think their, their, uh, direction is
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because it's fuel and these guys have
been doing a lot of fuel based work for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this stuff's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Gene's stuff is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those dudes you mentioned,
I'm familiar with them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Josh and, um, you know,
all the stuff there is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Final question for this one is I've got a
time machine for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any point in time, presumably to collect
some genetics could be seeds, could be
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings, could be whatever, where are you
going to go and what are you going to get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I think I would go all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny because it w it would be
the least commercially valuable because
[SPEAKER_01]: until you see feral populations,
you just realize there's very little on
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would like to go back to where we
map cannabis, merge with humans,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would be Nepal, like, you know,
plains of the Himalayas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, 14,000 years ago,
I would, I would like to see the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: from then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to see the plant that really
drove people's obsession to move it so
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily on the Silk route and down into
these regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'd like to experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what, what is it in its own
adulterated form?
[SPEAKER_00]: The true P1, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know what, and I mean,
we, we know that cannabis is a million
[SPEAKER_01]: years old, but we can only go back 14,000
with any kind of recorded history,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that'd be enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could go back 14,000 years and,
and experience the plains of Mongolia and
[SPEAKER_01]: get to see how they use the plan and eat
the seeds and drink the tea and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then throw bales of it in the fire,
in the cave and have rituals and shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, that's what they would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they weren't smoking that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were using it as firewood,
but they would get ripped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I love to experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think because otherwise I've,
I'm really been happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been able to touch and smoke and see
and experience so much that it would,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would just be awesome to go back and
see our roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Pakistan did for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was this, it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was, it was different than any
other place I'd been to because the people
[SPEAKER_01]: had been in the Valley, you know,
for 1500 years, each family.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, we've always been here,
you know, 15 centuries herb has been here
[SPEAKER_01]: before us.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we've always done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've always eaten it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've always drank it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've always smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just lets you understand the
holistic complete relationship with the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that I only really knew in skewed
form.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't until I got into medical
cannabis that I really started to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand medical applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we get into the discovery of CBD and
you get the really seeded CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: how many applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I get into doing all the green
juice work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you start to see it in its acid form,
unconverted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, my gosh, if we had mixed
cannabinoids, we would have these impacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we had acid form, we would have these
impacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my, my career just kept turning the
facet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kept turning the stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get to see more and more facets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to see so much that I'm just
grateful that I got to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just been this never ending turning
of a stone that's unlimited in depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how far I go, the deeper I dive,
the farther from the bottom I find myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a student of life by the sounds
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like that's just about the
end of it for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any comments or shout outs you'd like to
make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just want to say thank you for

for taking the time to listen to me,

[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for the support and be nice.
