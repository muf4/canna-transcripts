[SPEAKER_00]: All righty, so a big, big, big thank you
and welcome to the regenerative farming
[SPEAKER_00]: warrior and exceptionally talented
breeder, Jesse of BioVortex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've enjoyed your show so much over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, you're too kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate the kind words you gave
me at Emerald Cup last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't expect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really nice of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it felt really good to have you in the
audience too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, just I've listened to the way
I've got a lot from hearing breeders get
[SPEAKER_03]: to go into their thought process and just
the way that you create this form format.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel that you get a real stream of
consciousness that I've gained so much
[SPEAKER_03]: from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've had a lot of my friends on here
too that I've worked with over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, like we've talked a lot and
I get to even gain a lot from listening to
[SPEAKER_03]: them on your show, even after years of
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really appreciate that format.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to have you in the audience at the
Emerald Cup when we did the regenerative
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis breeding panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also we did another California just
humble breeder panel that had just an
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I was happy to have you in the
audience to get to hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're too kind, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first question we like to ask our
guests, what have you been smoking on
[SPEAKER_00]: recently?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, today it's mostly been black dog
with a mixture of banana dog rosin from
[SPEAKER_03]: Garden of Greece and not rosin actually,
it's straight ice water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hasho just was pressed out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also some 24k from Resin Ranch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just exceptional flavored,
great, great citrus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, some cherry lime dog flowers
too, which is just kind of one of my
[SPEAKER_03]: favorites, that combination between Mean
Gene's cherry lime pop and the black dog
[SPEAKER_03]: and been playing with that for the last
seven several years and some of my
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite aromas and flavors have come out
of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a pretty constant one,
but that's what I've been smoking on
[SPEAKER_03]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a lovely little selection there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a lovely selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few things I'd love to chat
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're definitely going to chat
cherry lime dog because that's a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: interest to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to quickly backtrack,
you said the 24k, that's an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: one because the citrus turps have been
dominant for a while and now they're kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like almost making a comeback,
but in like a sort of a changed form,
[SPEAKER_00]: like with other stuff brought into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on citrus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think we've reached the peak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think we're past it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you predict it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a lot of a lot of
different types of citrus.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's certain citrus that, you know,
works more or less with other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have those hazy citrus, you have the
piney citrus, you have sometimes it's more
[SPEAKER_03]: on the lime, some more lemon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get straight mandarin, you have,
you know, full lemon, like a lemon tree or
[SPEAKER_03]: something, or mandarin, like mandarin or
nectarine, or you have, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: different ways citrus expresses itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I like about the 24k is it's,
I feel like it's the like, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: the juice and gas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the sweet orange citrus with a
bit of that, that gas and earth that I,
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoy that a little bit more than
maybe some of the super spiky hazy citrus,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I also enjoy too, but I,
for all the time, I kind of like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that little bit more gas with that citrus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think like the mandarin and that 24k
seem to deliver that really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, they yield pretty well in ice
water hash too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a, what a bang on description.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, while we're talking about it,
what's your thoughts on like the Kosher
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Jew gold, you know, they're kind
of the two gassy OG things, which I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: feel get as much of a mention as some of
the other OG cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you find them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it's, it's difficult too,
to know like, if we're talking about the
[SPEAKER_03]: same thing all the time too, whether it's
a certain cut that was the basis for
[SPEAKER_03]: something or whether it's the feminized
seeds that were put out in Europe and
[SPEAKER_03]: what, what is your definition of that
variety?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, yeah, I enjoy those,
those gas flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a, if it's coming from a long line
of very similar OG cuts, and it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: different versions of the, of a similar
thing that I've enjoyed since I was,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, since late, well, I guess,
yeah, late nineties, early two thousands
[SPEAKER_03]: or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I've always enjoyed those flavors
and stuck with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll have to get into that,
but just as one last quick question on
[SPEAKER_00]: this subject, what's your favorite OG,
if you had to pick one?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was good from the beginning,
just the standard kind of the first OG cut
[SPEAKER_03]: that we saw like really in circulation and
around probably 2002.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and it's very similar to the SFV,
very similar to Tahoe and Trinidad,
[SPEAKER_03]: Lost Coast OG, yeah, they all had that,
that same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes it's like, is it just being
grown in a different spot or not?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's hard for me to, to fully know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't have, I don't have all of
them saved or the records to know like
[SPEAKER_03]: what's what, but I don't have a,
a favorite cause they were all so similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really if, how it was grown at the
time too, like is this a real living soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: is it just perfectly done organic indoor?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a really nice light up?
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, and then just having that
addictive banging kind of gas flavor at,
[SPEAKER_03]: at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's interesting what OG did with
our area.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually, it created an appellation of
its own and then like a very free market
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of way.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact that there was this variety of
variety that had this addictive flavor
[SPEAKER_03]: that we were growing out in the Hills and
in, in light depth and getting incredibly
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful flowers that were better looking
than indoor and better, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially anyone who messed up their
indoor, which was most people.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like people could come from all over
and just make a ton of money on selling
[SPEAKER_03]: this stuff at top shelf indoor flowers,
because it blew away their indoor flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it created a really an appellation
cause it was a flavor and a standard of
[SPEAKER_03]: this area that happened with light depth
and OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really made a lot of, a lot of
history and a lot of economic strangeness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes me wonder, let's say you had
to make a, you know, a bit of a pie in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sky, I guess, but let's say like,
you know, 25 years from now, most
[SPEAKER_00]: countries around the world are legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think America would look into
really pushing that appellation sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing a bit harder with specific strains
in the way we see like wines and stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think people are still going to
just pick different genetics each year and
[SPEAKER_00]: do their thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it is definitely happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's really smart, amazing,
excellent farms and breeders and advocates
[SPEAKER_03]: that are working towards that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And luckily these are a lot of the people
who, who very much support the
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative cannabis farming movement and
these ideals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're putting, and also real
science.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, there is an appellation
project in Humboldt that's going into
[SPEAKER_03]: place right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Holly Hall is helping head a lot of
the research and the fundraising for the
[SPEAKER_03]: getting nine different weather stations
that will be put in different legacy farms
[SPEAKER_03]: with good practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can start get recording all of the
environmental data from high quality
[SPEAKER_03]: weather stations that will be properly
monitored.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Janine Coleman has been leading
this amazing appellation project from
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendo and in Humboldt and has been doing
just this incredibly difficult work
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's such a complex issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like we're dealing with, you know,
cannabis is so complex to begin with and
[SPEAKER_03]: then appellations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're dealing with everyone's
different perspectives and everyone's
[SPEAKER_03]: different cultures and everyone's
different spot and what's special about
[SPEAKER_03]: their place and what's special about their
genetic and what's special about their
[SPEAKER_03]: terroir.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also like, who do you include and what
doesn't get included?
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, is a plant grown in a pot in a
greenhouse or in indoor in that location
[SPEAKER_03]: qualifies that as an appellation when
we're talking about environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, things like, do the roots
need to be in the ground?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it okay if there was other added
potting soil or amendments?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it okay if there's some environmental
controls?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, there's a lot of things
to kind of hash out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on the, the side of like, as long as
those roots are tapped into that soil and
[SPEAKER_03]: that it is part of that environment and
it's not environmental control and you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have artificial lights, then that's
qualifying for an appellation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The second you go indoor or an
environmentally controlled greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_03]: the second that you have a pot that does
not allow the roots to go into the ground,
[SPEAKER_03]: then I think that those suspend the idea
of an appellation because you're taking
[SPEAKER_03]: out the environmental aspect of it,
which is such an important part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, the culture part of it,
the breeding, the art, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like all of that is a huge part of an
appellation too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, how do you grow a cultivar?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like which, what are you breeding for?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what are you doing with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's, that all is part of it
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think that the environment has to
be a part of that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really excited about all the
amazing people that are working on this
[SPEAKER_03]: and amazing farmers too, like Moonmade
Farms, Tina Gordon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so many are, are doing a lot of work
and actually the women have been
[SPEAKER_03]: spearheading this pretty hard,
like just a powerful group of incredibly
[SPEAKER_03]: intelligent, powerful people that are,
are, are doing the, the, the work that I'd
[SPEAKER_03]: want to see done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's so many ways to get
these things wrong and I'm really
[SPEAKER_03]: concerned about things that could restrict
freedoms.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't want people growing only
one kind of cultivar in a place because
[SPEAKER_03]: that goes to monoculture, that goes to all
these different issues or restrict a
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer from breeding in their own
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the whole point is to establish these
things that are a part of the culture,
[SPEAKER_03]: a part of the farmers, a part of the
breeders, a part of making something that
[SPEAKER_03]: makes sense for that area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think biodiversity goes with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, you don't just be like,
oh, this place is known for this variety,
[SPEAKER_03]: this cultivar, because that same farm
should be able to grow a type one,
[SPEAKER_03]: a type two, type three, type four.
[SPEAKER_03]: They should be able to like, you know,
CBD THC, they should be able to have
[SPEAKER_03]: things that are harvested early,
things that are harvested late that are
[SPEAKER_03]: different sizes that make sense in their
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and that's a very dynamic landscape.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think of like a green source
gardens, like you think of all of the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the breeding that they're doing and then
all the different growing that they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, that's to me, like very much
what an Appalachian is, but they are
[SPEAKER_03]: working on so many different cultivars at
the same time and having a full
[SPEAKER_03]: polyculture mixed in with their,
like many of the other regenerative farms,
[SPEAKER_03]: like moon gazer farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just great examples of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of hard for bureaucracy to
understand that kind of like freedom and
[SPEAKER_03]: polyculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm hopeful that maybe this is the
place where we can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a really knowledgeable little burst
of info there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people have to redo that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested to know, cause I got two
questions from two fans and one of them
[SPEAKER_00]: was related to, they were kind of
interested in trying to do what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about in their own little setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were saying, do you think it
would be beneficial to get that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: process going to kind of do your own IMO
and try to like culture your own
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous microbes from your area,
as opposed to say, using like maybe an EM1
[SPEAKER_00]: or like, like a good microbial source,
but it's external.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you recommend that like,
that could be a viable way to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial activity going that's related to
your terroir?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you think it's a bit more complex
than that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a cultivator that's asking
about living soil cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this indoor or outdoor?
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of situation are we talking
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they recently moved to a new
property and they're looking to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were kind of wondering,
like the first time you grow something,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there terroir there immediately,
or does it have to develop over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do I need to use IMOs and things like
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the terroir is there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, like any gardening and
the whole idea of regenerative farming is
[SPEAKER_03]: the fact that you make something thrive
more every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you do the things that build nutrition,
that build, that generate more life just
[SPEAKER_03]: by going through, you know, the cycles of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so by cover cropping in the fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So after you've grown your crop,
you immediately start your cover crop
[SPEAKER_03]: before the rains come.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that grows over the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the nitrogen fixing bacteria that
work with the root nodules in something
[SPEAKER_03]: like fava beans or something like peas or
bell beans or vetch, those are pulling
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen from the air and they are fixing
it into the ground just through the
[SPEAKER_03]: process of photosynthesis and through the
process of having a mutualistic
[SPEAKER_03]: relationship with bacteria that they
literally create these nodules to house
[SPEAKER_03]: the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they grow these big things that they
put out resources to make sure that they
[SPEAKER_03]: are housing and taking care of these
bacteria that can process the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: from the air, which literally is one of
the most difficult things to break apart
[SPEAKER_03]: is a triple bond.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the hardest bond to break apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And two in the air is two nitrogens
together in a triple bond.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing that has enough energy to
break that apart is a lightning bolt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like when lightning hits,
like some of that nitrogen in the air
[SPEAKER_03]: becomes free and it can attach to water
and oxygen and different things in the
[SPEAKER_03]: air, then rain down as actual usable
nitrates for the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you actually get some nitrogen in your
rains when there's thunderstorms.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the bacteria have the enzymes that can
start working on those triple bonds and
[SPEAKER_03]: they can take them apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the plant houses basically a laboratory
that allows these enzymes to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so just by planting these seeds,
all of a sudden you're able to pull the
[SPEAKER_03]: most difficult thing, the nutrient that
everything needs to build proteins that's
[SPEAKER_03]: locked up in our air and should be too.
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, the nitrogen cycle,
it's really important to keep it the way
[SPEAKER_03]: it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've really messed it up by
artificially producing nitrogen through
[SPEAKER_03]: the Harbor Bosch process, where we're
actually using pressures in a catalyst and
[SPEAKER_03]: hydrocarbons to fuel it all to make
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we do is we've literally put more
than twice the amount of nitrogen into the
[SPEAKER_03]: system that should be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you see a lot of issues with
rivers, with water quality, with die-offs,
[SPEAKER_03]: with blooms of algae, with toxic blooms,
and with full on die-off because all the
[SPEAKER_03]: oxygen is robbed from the water.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a really big deal that we think
about nitrogen in a way that is
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative, that is the way that the
planet has always done it because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: always kept it in a balance and it's
allocated those resources in an amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much of it's locked up in the sky.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bacteria can release the right amount
for plants to be able to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lightning releases the right amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've just completely changed
that just like we have with so many other
[SPEAKER_03]: things and CO2 in the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the other thing that you're
doing when you're cover cropping is you're
[SPEAKER_03]: actually taking carbon from the air and
you are storing it in these plant cells in
[SPEAKER_03]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're growing and they're taking
more carbon from the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what photosynthesis is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's taking carbon from the air and it's
building plant matter with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get organic material from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's also like with cannabis,
that's where we get all our
[SPEAKER_03]: phytochemicals, all our medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's literally coming from pulling carbon
from the air and growing from that through
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: With roots and with microorganisms and
doing that in balance is just what we need
[SPEAKER_03]: to do with everything in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so just the simple process of putting
out a cover crop seed at the right time,
[SPEAKER_03]: you pull in carbon, you build it into the
soil, that carbon is stored in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It feeds more microbiology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while you're pulling that carbon,
the microbiology in the root nodules are
[SPEAKER_03]: pulling in the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And making that a nutrient rich soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all you have to do is mulch that back
in the spring and plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've just built soil and you've
built fertility while doing a positive
[SPEAKER_03]: thing for the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then those plants get to grow with all
of the nutrition and the organic matter
[SPEAKER_03]: that you just grew out of thin air in a
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a fantastic explanation of nitrogen
fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think people need to listen
to that one again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess there's maybe just a follow on
in relation to our listeners question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you did exactly what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd done some nice cover crop and you've
plowed it in and you're looking to go
[SPEAKER_00]: again this season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it doesn't have to be plow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plow makes a lot of sense, certainly in
dry farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plowing is the way that it is done for,
well, in certain places like riverbanks
[SPEAKER_03]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You plow it in, it gets eaten quickly,
and then you actually disturb the soil in
[SPEAKER_03]: a way that works for the dry farming
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer in certain locations mulching in
so you can figure out what you have on a
[SPEAKER_03]: property that would work to mulch
something in, whether it's a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: cardboard or maybe wood chips or depth
covers for a moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although the plastic you want to be
careful about because you only want to do
[SPEAKER_03]: a certain amount of time and make sure
that the oxygen and that you aren't
[SPEAKER_03]: harming, but you are just returning
organic matter to the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, worms will come up as soon
as something's covered and start eating
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get all the millipedes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get all kinds of diversity of
creatures that get all this food that they
[SPEAKER_03]: get to eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you just talk about frass or
compost teas.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening on the top of this
surface is just everything you could never
[SPEAKER_03]: even buy in the store.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's every positive thing you could
imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just piles of it that just happen
overnight constantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just come up and they eat and they
poop and they give everything that the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants want as this layer of organic
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: goes back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'm a big fan of mulching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes the tilling makes sense for and
there's certain farmers who really know
[SPEAKER_03]: what they're doing and they know how to
maximize production and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: really reduce resource use.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other cases, maybe that's not the place
the thing to do for that because you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to encourage a different type of soil
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, whether that's using
rotational grazing or whether it's fully
[SPEAKER_03]: mulching and developing more perennials,
there's lots of different strategies.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I would encourage mulching as
well as not just tilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my bad using the wrong wording there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely... No, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, because both are very needed and
viable and make sense in their applicable
[SPEAKER_03]: scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get too in depth,
because we're definitely going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: further down the organics rabbit hole,
take me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of as early as my memories are just
watering beautiful plants as a baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then next would be Monday night
football.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a roommate who old peace
activist and he actually had a radio show
[SPEAKER_03]: too on KPFA and it was about social
justice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But every Monday night, everyone would go
in to his room and watch Monday night
[SPEAKER_03]: football.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember really enjoying when,
you know, people talk like this as they
[SPEAKER_03]: pass the joint and held it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, man, everyone's super nice
when they talk like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just fun watching,
you know, a football game with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: happy adults that are, you know,
very carefree and enjoying each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and the smell was wonderful,
you know, just this wonderful lingering
[SPEAKER_03]: smell in the air and just positive
memories, positive memories.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, as a teenager,
just starting to smoke with friends and
[SPEAKER_03]: also just being interested in the seeds,
too, and watching the plants grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I kind of, you know, both started
around the same time pretty early for me,
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think 13, 14 is when you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was about the right age for me to
start perking my interest back into
[SPEAKER_03]: something that I'd seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although where I grew up, there was no
more growing it was only early when I was
[SPEAKER_03]: a kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they made a decision that just
with legal, you know, issues that they
[SPEAKER_03]: they were not going to risk the property
actually grew up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The property I grew up on was Joan Baez's
old place, a place that is was named by
[SPEAKER_03]: her struggle mountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's connected to the nonviolent
movements and the movement against the
[SPEAKER_03]: Vietnam War.
[SPEAKER_03]: And multiple social justice movements,
as well as being connected to this thing
[SPEAKER_03]: called the land, which was a area up there
that basically intentional communities
[SPEAKER_03]: were built on land that was accessible at
that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they they built all kinds of cool
houses.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had irrigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's spring systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a a long haul for for meetings
and for dances.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and there was back to landers and
there was front landers that were more
[SPEAKER_03]: political.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to landers were more about living off
the land and the gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so yeah, there's a rich history
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they like cannabis and stuff,
but decided that, you know, the the
[SPEAKER_03]: properties and stuff of that era,
it wasn't it just wasn't worth the legal
[SPEAKER_03]: risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: During the time, you know, and I grew up
during the Reagan era and the the the war
[SPEAKER_03]: on drugs, which always seemed like just a
horrible crime against human rights and
[SPEAKER_03]: humanity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't wait to see that as as
something so far in the past and just as
[SPEAKER_03]: something is it's just a disgusting,
horrible thing that destroyed so many
[SPEAKER_03]: lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't wait till it's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what were some of the earliest strains
you can remember when you first were
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it at a time when it was still like
the kind and it wasn't really named?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, it's a little bit in
between.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't so much about the names as it
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was interesting things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like we had the Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a certain variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was super good that like my friend
would get every Monday.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like we had the crackhead and it
was just so strong and so stimulating that
[SPEAKER_03]: it was just like crack, you know,
and it smelled so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's actually one I super long for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to find that profile again,
because it was it was actually very
[SPEAKER_03]: addictive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, a lot of things just weren't they
were just really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you just call something like,
well, it's a golden indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was the flavor profile and the
way that it grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember coming up to Humboldt,
like so I grew up with like Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_03]: Mountains and also the indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a relatively it was extremely
wealthy area in Palo Alto as far as kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have any money or anything,
but like all the kids around me were
[SPEAKER_03]: tremendously wealthy in general in that
area.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the booming of Silicon Valley.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so actually, the weed was incredibly
good because there is the economic driver
[SPEAKER_03]: for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be I remember like we didn't like we
just didn't see sweat, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mexican or brick or or even like the
letter like for ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, honestly, we just had like,
you know, because you're buying eights and
[SPEAKER_03]: twamps and this stuff like at least the
kids are in like and it had to be really
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the quality standards were super
high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So honestly, we started with like the
best.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I remember I remember like
somebody like coming with like brick weed
[SPEAKER_03]: and just like everyone's like it was a
novelty for a second and everyone had a
[SPEAKER_03]: headache.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the next day, like I don't think
you could sell it for any price,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you could sell a gram for 20 bucks the
next day, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's just yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And coming up here, I remember the first
time coming up in Humboldt, still in high
[SPEAKER_03]: school and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we got some honeydew, which at the
time was like, is that the name of the
[SPEAKER_03]: variety?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the place that it came?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had that kind of pre ninety eight bubba
look and structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was just extra gooey and had kind
of a honeydew smell, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that made you even think like,
is it called honeydew because of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I know it came from it had to come
from honeydew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was probably like that,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was, you know, looked better than,
you know, a lot of the indoor people are
[SPEAKER_03]: used to as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, if you paid the right price,
freaking you got fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up on an insanely good herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love putting away like the really
nice seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always just wanted to grow all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just really interested in seeds
and really interested in putting different
[SPEAKER_03]: things together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just always saved and categorized and
like any nog that it came from,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like save the nog and save the seed
with it and write down information about
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I had, you know, like started
doing my first programs, I had all this
[SPEAKER_03]: information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just literally from the flowers,
you know, it wasn't like, oh, I bought it
[SPEAKER_03]: from here and I know that it's this or
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just just from my own observations and
the nogs that it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back at that time was did people talk
about seeds you found in bud as though it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, oh, you know, you shouldn't grow
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it more accepted that you could get
some nice stuff out of seed you found in
[SPEAKER_00]: bud?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if the flower is super nice and
it's a treasure, you know, like I think
[SPEAKER_02]: you might as well look what's why not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also there wasn't so much information
or misinformation going on where people
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't necessarily have, you know,
set ideas of what is a good thing or a bad
[SPEAKER_03]: thing or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And God, I mean, if you pull a seed out of
a flower that was just like the best
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor and best effect, like that's a
freaking treasure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it away and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you accumulated your kind of
little treasure trove of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called it the vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vault.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everyone needs to get the vault
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And was this kind of what spurred you to
get growing initially?
[SPEAKER_00]: And were those seeds some of the first
ones you planted?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did that go?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, doing cool gorilla grows and
with springs and and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: nice for soil and and growing some of
those varieties and then doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God, probably not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was 98 doing indoors up an arcade,
actually moving up here at that time and
[SPEAKER_03]: humble and running through the vault.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I did was I just named all kinds
of different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly I was pretty into Greek mythology,
and so I'd name them different Greek
[SPEAKER_03]: names.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the ones that stood out was
Athena.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a cultivar that's still with me
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as far as like through the breeding,
there's like, yeah, 25 years of different
[SPEAKER_03]: projects with her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, that's that's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it makes me wonder what do you
have any specific end direction or it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just more of like a blank canvas and you
just see where it takes you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, she's taken me a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's it's a canvas.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's honestly it's not an end direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's the plant teaches me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what a brilliant sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question I love to ask breeders
when you made your first cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: was it an accident or was it intentional
and what happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the first cross that I'd call a
cross that went to something else as far
[SPEAKER_03]: as making a clone selection and then other
people growing that clone selection out
[SPEAKER_03]: was actually just the Bubba selection that
made up here with a friend back about
[SPEAKER_03]: 2001.
[SPEAKER_03]: Crossing that on to and that became
actually the Bubba that was pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: grown up here and became the main Bubba
and mixing that with the Athena that I was
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about that selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was Athena Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that actually was grown quite a lot up
here and was just an amazing hybrid
[SPEAKER_03]: between them, just insane, giant
trichomes, amazing resin production,
[SPEAKER_03]: really great division between flowers,
just tons of beauty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it couldn't get powdery mildew,
which a lot of people really like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it ended up getting grown quite a bit
in that that clone variety form.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, so all throughout the early
2000s, that was a pretty, pretty popular
[SPEAKER_03]: variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the Humble area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you feel like that was kind of
what really lit the passion to start
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for you, seeing that success
people were having or was it, it was
[SPEAKER_00]: already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, you know, nice to see people
enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always been interested in plants and
putting things together.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that, I mean, that, that,
that success of that was, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that was definitely a great spark to
continue to see all the different cool
[SPEAKER_03]: things you can put together and what can
come out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also being able to see how those come
out on all these different farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I, you know, way back then I was
already doing this, where I got to go see
[SPEAKER_03]: something you worked on grown in all these
different places and seeing the different
[SPEAKER_03]: expressions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just massively interesting to
begin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never stopped being it's like what I
do every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like go to all the farms and see
everyone growing all the seeds and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and try to take in as much information,
as much art photography, as much,
[SPEAKER_03]: as much understanding of their practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then hopefully knowing everything
about the flowers and the products that
[SPEAKER_03]: get made from it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it all is just amazing information
for the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It segues really brilliantly into
something I think we both wanted to touch
[SPEAKER_00]: on a little bit, which is kind of,
you're talking about how there's all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different facets that you like to approach
cannabis from, you know, not just growing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but the photography, the information,
the research documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it raises the overall
question kind of what is BioVortex to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've seen you post online and I'm
assuming that maybe not everyone has seen
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but it was a great post.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love for you to be able to tell the
listeners, you know, what is BioVortex?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just a name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it something a lot more than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you pitch it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's been a thing of confusion a
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's like, oh, is this a,
you know, is it just a genetics company?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you selling Vortex Brewers or are you
a living soil consultant or, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I do all these things,
I guess, like I make seeds and I make,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and I've made Vortex Brewers and
I've made living soil and consulted on
[SPEAKER_03]: that and helped all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really at the base of it, and also
just the whole, you know, the regenerative
[SPEAKER_03]: farm award and all of all of that kind of
education towards that, that at the base
[SPEAKER_03]: of BioVortex, it is a conceptual art
piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it was from the beginning and
continues to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the concept of it is to influence the
cannabis industry towards a more
[SPEAKER_03]: ecological future, one that's thoughtful
about plant genetics, that is thoughtful
[SPEAKER_03]: about social justice, that is thoughtful
about the soil, about the earth,
[SPEAKER_03]: about how we cultivate, about the end
user.
[SPEAKER_03]: That putting all of this thought into how
we do something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I thought was really powerful and
about connecting these concepts with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is how much attention is cannabis
has right now and how much economic
[SPEAKER_03]: attention and medical attention that it
has that if we can really show these types
[SPEAKER_03]: of farming practices about these concepts,
these kinds of community, ethical
[SPEAKER_03]: practices and the way that we produce a
healing product that we can really drive
[SPEAKER_03]: and change the way we look at marketing,
the way that we look at medicine,
[SPEAKER_03]: the way that we look at agriculture and,
you know, forge a better future through
[SPEAKER_03]: that understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just, the Trojan horse of all the
enthusiasm of cannabis, I want to put
[SPEAKER_03]: these concepts into it and what's amazing
is cannabis is a consciousness uplifting
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that allows for these ideas to soar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so many different people that have
been inspired by some of these concepts
[SPEAKER_03]: have done so many amazing things or have
already been doing the work before,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's a mutualism and a synergy
between all the people that are working
[SPEAKER_03]: towards these goals that I think is
incredibly beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really that's what I want to cultivate
and encourage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a conceptual art piece that
wants to build community and awareness of
[SPEAKER_03]: ecology and all of the amazing things that
this plant can do for our mental
[SPEAKER_03]: awakening, for our society and for social
justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an incredibly detailed and really
kind of altruistic kind of body of work
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A question we commonly hear from our
listeners is that they struggle to
[SPEAKER_00]: conceptually see how the small farm can
progress going forward as things get
[SPEAKER_00]: harder to operate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think operating under these sort of
ideals and guidance is a way in which
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller people can still make things
possible to operate and maybe,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, earn a living from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think like all things,
it's just like things diversify.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many different things that
cannabis produces.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, no, I don't know if like small farms
make sense for large biomass for
[SPEAKER_03]: phytochemical companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it makes sense for large
biomass for fiber, but maybe it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on your end product,
your marketing and then like who you're
[SPEAKER_03]: working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that there'd be amazing people
doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But hopefully, you know, we can that the
practices are good regardless of the scale
[SPEAKER_03]: and that as a community that buys these
products that we are aware of these things
[SPEAKER_03]: and that we hold people responsible for
how they are producing things and really
[SPEAKER_03]: think about the environmental impacts in
certain large scale and monoculture and
[SPEAKER_03]: what we want to see from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as the small farm staying viable,
I think actually as far as the more I hate
[SPEAKER_03]: the word recreational because I think it's
all medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like the craft and the, you know,
and connoisseur market that that it's only
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be small farms because I think
that it only goes one direction as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't you don't experience true
quality and go backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't experience the quality of an
amazing dry farm peach, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: from an amazing farm like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the quality of that that flavor,
like it can't be reproduced.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't just buy it and have it shipped
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't, you know, recreate a Michelin
star restaurant that has a relationship
[SPEAKER_03]: with a small farmer near them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we already understand that
quality, but we have a lot of work to do
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as education for the consumers
through just even in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: but throughout the world, California might
have a very sophisticated market in
[SPEAKER_03]: general, but there's a lot of work to do
there in understanding practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's part of like the
regenerative cannabis farm award is like
[SPEAKER_03]: not just about products, not just about
flowers, which is, of course, king.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's like we need to know
what everyone loved smoking on the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's talk about the practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, some of these farms do
quite well in the contest as well with the
[SPEAKER_03]: insane products that they're they're
coming to the table with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we get to actually look at the
practices of these farms, like how are
[SPEAKER_03]: they growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they using water?
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they interacting with their
community?
[SPEAKER_03]: What medicines are they making?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is how we actually we created a
matrix to judge these different farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we go out on a site visit and we will
get the whole tour, go through everything,
[SPEAKER_03]: ask the questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then later we run it through this this
matrix of all these different aspects of
[SPEAKER_03]: what regenerative can mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of it is ecological.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's also like the community and
medical and social justice aspects of that
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and Dan Mar of high tide permaculture
has done an amazing job developing that
[SPEAKER_03]: with me with an amazing permaculture and
science mind ecology like that is put into
[SPEAKER_03]: it is it's very thoughtful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we get to kind of understand something
about these farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having these awards so people can see a
little bit more about these farms and
[SPEAKER_03]: making movies about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people can see the practices and
and know that they want a flower grown
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want a flower that's grown with love
that helps the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want a flower that comes from a farm
that that is a part of cannabis community,
[SPEAKER_03]: that is a part of, you know, their work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their water shed and their environment,
their forests that are true stewards,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as growing just insanely fire
herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think that we can get to a
point one day where the average consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: could take all of these factors into mind
and truly appreciate the quality of a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that comes from one of these farms
and view that as the best?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that it's hard for
consumers to understand?
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of the inner workings and why this
regenerative farmed product is so
[SPEAKER_00]: superior.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard, but it gets easier every year
and it takes a lot of cooperation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see more on the dispensary
ends.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some that are really cool,
soulful from a very early point in
[SPEAKER_03]: Sebastopol, California had been excited
about these regenerative farms and wanting
[SPEAKER_03]: to convey all the information they could
about them and have done an outstanding
[SPEAKER_03]: job with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then now we're really lucky to have
our dear friend, Crystal, who has opened
[SPEAKER_03]: up the humble urban market in Arcata.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think like no other dispensary,
it's going to really be able to tell that
[SPEAKER_03]: farm story because she is such a deep part
of cannabis community, important part of
[SPEAKER_03]: so much of the policy developing
appellations, and just working with all
[SPEAKER_03]: the farms and just being just a positive
pillar in the community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just so happy to have someone like
that being able to help educate the public
[SPEAKER_03]: to the amazing farming practices that are
happening on some of these farms,
[SPEAKER_03]: the quality differences and just giving
them access to really quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the rundown.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did the creation of Black Dog go down?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people are interested in
what the Genesis story was.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it starts with my dear friend,
Ryan, with Humble Seed Organization and
[SPEAKER_03]: projects that we were doing together from
an early point, you know, back in even a
[SPEAKER_03]: little ways into like the Athena Kush
days, like I got to meet him through my
[SPEAKER_03]: neighbor and we, you know, instantly were
close friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he was very ahead of the
game, understanding where, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: what was happening with seeds and,
you know, saw the work that I was doing
[SPEAKER_03]: and saw the potential and all of the
things that were happening here and did an
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing job bringing that to really the
whole world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with projects that, yeah,
we were working on together, just a
[SPEAKER_03]: regular Blackberry, you know, mother with
the Emerald headband it was, which was a
[SPEAKER_03]: California Sour Diesel with a lemon OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, yeah, it was kind of the Genesis
of the Black Dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And working with that in 2012,
I made a selection that was like just
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was, I actually originally called it
like Trimmers Delight because it was,
[SPEAKER_03]: it literally took less than two hours to
trim a pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, it was just like,
okay, that's way too much money.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was, it was, it was a dessert.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the, you know, when you finished
a hard job, like, okay, here's dessert.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you get to make a bunch real fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, and then of course, you know,
I like to just trim it myself too,
[SPEAKER_03]: but.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, that clone got saved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I just continued working with
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that kind of became the cannon for
what I was doing with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then really, I mean, Black Dog still
being made, you know, like that was 2012.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every year I've done multiple
different variations of back crosses or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, continuing sibling generations,
as well as probably at this point,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe crossed it onto 250, maybe different
things or more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then multiple generations from
multiple different crosses from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of this fun flagship project
where it's just like, I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_03]: everything you could possibly do with this
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, just unbelievable,
like stored potential in one plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like, yeah, just from all over the
world, you know, all the different things,
[SPEAKER_03]: like I've probably put it on Black Dog at
some point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something about having this one
plant with the stored information of such
[SPEAKER_03]: a vast worldwide genetic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well as having this super inbred line,
you know, getting that consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's what I really love is
just like hearing all the positive stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: from people's experience with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a lot of people where it's
helped them with medical issues,
[SPEAKER_03]: with addiction issues, with mental health
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that it puts them in a place that
helps them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something about the chemo type,
the terpene and the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: combination.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, nothing like specifically
unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not super potent or anything,
but it's just there's something the way it
[SPEAKER_03]: like connects you with nature balances
like it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people seem to have a very similar
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just so fucking pretty to watch
Crow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, she's a special one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I assume you've heard a plethora of
feedback from people about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but are there any kind of traits or
properties?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's pretty neat to see the hashtag
Black Dog Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it made sure to put the Kush on the
end so it's not buried in a pile of
[SPEAKER_03]: Labradors and stuff, which would happen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, if anyone just tags Black Dog,
it's like, no one's going to see that
[SPEAKER_03]: hashtag, I promise you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you do Black Dog Kush, it's like,
it's pretty good, but there's thousands
[SPEAKER_03]: from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really amazing to see and,
you know, super thankful with the
[SPEAKER_03]: relationship with, yeah, the friend Ryan
and Eric and Humboldt Seed Organization
[SPEAKER_03]: with getting that everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really, really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are there any characteristics or
problems you feel it's particularly good
[SPEAKER_00]: for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for example, if someone was having
like low energy or like, is there anything
[SPEAKER_00]: which stands out you think it's quite good
for if patients were having that issue?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's good for what it's good for
for the person, you know, I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: pigeonhole it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the one thing that has been
consistent, though, is a connection with
[SPEAKER_03]: nature and a balancing, which helps with a
lot of things, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you prefer in general to kind of
work lines till you've got a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you a bit more like, let's do some
F1s and kind of see what comes out of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, every year I work a few
lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: I figure out what is possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, maybe that's one,
maybe it's four, maybe it's six,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe it's two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on top of that, I just try to do
every freaking thing I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, yeah, I make and yeah,
I make all kinds of poly hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I try to, I try to set things up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I make probability waves is kind of how I
think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I set multiple different timings
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have my like super planned out,
like my four projects, like I'm doing this
[SPEAKER_03]: year that are like, you know, I'm doing my
Cherry Lime Dog BC1 F3s and I'm making the
[SPEAKER_03]: Cherry Lime Dog F4s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm doing a very concentrated,
you know, effort towards making those be
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly what I want them to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, I have maybe a
hundred different varieties that are
[SPEAKER_03]: staggered at different times that will be
for different projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will just try to see what makes
sense at each time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's a lot of thought going
into how I set it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is the way the probability
wave collapses, I might not know until the
[SPEAKER_03]: days that they come, you know,
as you smell a variety that you see their
[SPEAKER_03]: resistance, that you see their profiles
and that you see, you know, what kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: mail might work with them or what the
timing will be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, what you want to save,
what you want to clone, what pollen you'd
[SPEAKER_03]: want to save, which ones you want to put
together and what kind of preservation
[SPEAKER_03]: work that you might be doing, just putting
a couple of things together that you
[SPEAKER_03]: already have, or are you going to do a
whole lot of new things?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to do it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just work really hard on a couple of
lines and then I make a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the question that comes to
mind for me is, like the Athena,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think there's an end point or is it
a forever changing and morphing sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of art?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, forever changing, morphing piece of
art.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to manipulate that
relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something about that plant that
she's just given me so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I'm just going to just watch and
learn from her and each year see what
[SPEAKER_03]: happens and make sure to preserve things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've lost some of the things that I might
have thought that I wanted to continue,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I've also gained so many others.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I'm just open to where that
goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as long as I still see her in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And out of the current crosses you're
working on, I mean, you mentioned the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry Lime Dog earlier on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the ones you're really
excited to delve more into?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that flavor right now, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the thing is, it doesn't even have
to just... So I'm looking at just Cherry
[SPEAKER_03]: Lime Dog as multiple ways to dive into the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I took the Cherry Lime Dog
and, you know, I made my F2s from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I was also like, out of those
F2s, I'm like, you know, I kind of want it
[SPEAKER_03]: to look a lot like the Black Dog structure
too and bring some of that back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just I put some of that back onto the
2012 Black Dog clone to make the VC1.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I made the F2s with those and I'm
making the F3s right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like it's kind of going down to
different line, although it's still I did
[SPEAKER_03]: make my selection holding on to the flavor
profile that I really like that a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Cherry Lime Pop, you know,
shines through from that, from Jackson,
[SPEAKER_03]: from Mean Gene, Freeborn selections.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like it's a super great blend
with the Black Dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: It like, yeah, it just got that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got the right harmony of the blends
of flavor and then but it's a little more
[SPEAKER_03]: Black Dog in structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is also a more uniform,
dwarfy and I also made a dark selection
[SPEAKER_03]: and a slightly lighter selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one that just turns purple super quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like right now, it's like really,
really dark, just with the first little
[SPEAKER_03]: like nugs coming up for the breeding
project I'm working on right now with
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frosted out like crazy just at,
you know, they're not even a half an inch
[SPEAKER_03]: like wide yet, but just completely coated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And dark, but they have the structure of
the Black Dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're, they're consistent.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're squatty.
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't need any caging.
[SPEAKER_03]: They need no effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't water or feed or do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of like breeding for plants that
you don't have to do anything to and that
[SPEAKER_03]: produce a tremendous amount for their
biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't, they're not necessarily the
monster plants that you need to cage and
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, take up all this space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but the thing is, they're producing
more flowers per the rest of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, and if you have the next to each
other, you're probably going to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: more productive square footage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do like breeding about thinking about
those kinds of lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with the Cherry Lime Dog F4s that
are making right now, I'm kind of going
[SPEAKER_03]: with the more classic hybrid growth where
they were, they're a taller one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Cherry Lime Pop was tall and it had a
really nice mix with the Black Dog where
[SPEAKER_03]: it was still like a medium tall plant,
but it was well structured from the Black
[SPEAKER_03]: Dog, but not the, I had problems with the
overstretching of the, the lime pop in
[SPEAKER_03]: this area.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the branches got too wet or wind and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, they had a tendency to break a
little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really don't, I'm kind of an all
natural style and I don't want to have to
[SPEAKER_03]: do cages and things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that the Black Dog structure really
worked great to keep those, those stems
[SPEAKER_03]: and branches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but the, you know, the, the F3
generation is, is a nice tall,
[SPEAKER_03]: fast growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not all squatty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, that's nice for people too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it just has a just insane flavor
profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I did a pretty big selection last
year and that God, it was so, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: it wasn't giant or whatever, but it was so
hard to choose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it was literally like, this is my
favorite aroma I've ever smelled in my
[SPEAKER_03]: life.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this one is, no, this one is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, um, you know, and so the one I
ended up like popping from like,
[SPEAKER_03]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The aroma from that is just like,
yeah, it's from the gods for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And big, big respect to Jackson for his,
his nose and his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes me wonder then, are there any
other sort of modern genetics or modern
[SPEAKER_00]: clones that you would be interested in
incorporating into the Black Dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Dog line, just kind of seeing where
it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, you could literally probably name
every single one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's already happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, like, well, and, and like hash
lines too, like the banana dog is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is, uh, been wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I mentioned smoking on some of
that hash earlier too, that, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: the garden of Greece did Cush Kirk and,
um, Amanda, they, uh, they are just
[SPEAKER_03]: freaking hash artists and, and amazing
regenerative farmers, dragonfly earth
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine, uh, pure farmers up in Oregon,
just, just making, uh, honestly,
[SPEAKER_03]: like their freezer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the best, the highest concentration
of the pest hash in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I was just like, I went up with,
with simply Adam and we're just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, they just took our breath away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, some of the best gourmet experiences
of my life, uh, with actually their puppy
[SPEAKER_03]: breath, which was the Mendo breath with,
uh, an SFE, uh, black dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and yeah, so, I mean, there's two,
you know, SFEOG and Mendo breath on,
[SPEAKER_03]: on black dog, but oh my God, the,
the quality of that hash is just
[SPEAKER_03]: unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so, um, just great structure,
great consistency too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just like snap it off and like,
it just took a second to like press it and
[SPEAKER_03]: it just, like, I mean, the idea of rosing
that quality of, of full melt would be so
[SPEAKER_03]: insane because it's just so, so beyond,
you just touch it and it's already so
[SPEAKER_03]: beyond rosin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then, and then it holds a
consistency too, where it's like amber.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can like break it even at room
temperature where like other stuff would
[SPEAKER_03]: just kind of get a little like,
you know, start to be a little more
[SPEAKER_03]: volatile, a little greasy, um,
you know, either cake or grease.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, this has this like jewel like
quality to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the puppy breath had that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, it makes it really easy to catch
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they get really high yields and,
um, they were very resistant to very mold
[SPEAKER_03]: resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I love breeding for high ice water
hash yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really interested in trichome
morphology, um, and also, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: bud structure and, um, and then also the
terpene and cannabinoid, uh, production
[SPEAKER_03]: that is associated with, uh, trichomes
that are easier to work with, with ice
[SPEAKER_03]: water hash that lead to higher yields.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also thinking about like where
the, um, you know, getting different
[SPEAKER_03]: unique flavors and how you could do that
with, with still getting a decent return
[SPEAKER_03]: on other varieties that might not be as,
uh, good for, for catching in a,
[SPEAKER_03]: in a mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a, what a sort of conscious effort
with breeding to take it in that
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then with CBD too, I really want to do
that with CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have the last couple of years,
I have some pretty, you know, good,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, beginning successes towards that
effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited for like, um, uh, the holy
tonic selection, which was a Big Sur,
[SPEAKER_03]: holy weed, can a tonic cross that there's
a two to one selection that has the right
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, some of the different
crosses with that, like, um, black black
[SPEAKER_03]: Sapphire on that, which is double black
dog, Sapphire scout, holy crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then just straight black dog on
that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, some of these are gonna,
they, they're going to come out with the
[SPEAKER_03]: right trichomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also did some banana OG Harless Sue,
but really the, the can a tonic and the
[SPEAKER_03]: holy tonic, um, crosses are, are look like
they're going to work really the
[SPEAKER_03]: selections that I made years ago of,
of these, they're, they're specific ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and a really orangey, really
beautiful, um, high trichome content
[SPEAKER_03]: variety of the, the can a tonic that's a
three to one, uh, that the holy tonic was,
[SPEAKER_03]: was, was made from.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just more than most CBD varieties,
they have the type of trichomes that could
[SPEAKER_03]: do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen some good successes so far.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really excited, uh, for some of the
research projects that are happening this
[SPEAKER_03]: year with that and seeing that with come
to fruition with some of the extractors
[SPEAKER_03]: and farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, a question I've had for a
little while now is, do you think that
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately terroir is able to manifest
itself more so in hash maybe than flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you think it's more perceivably
noticeable if you made a product kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like what you described that that might
stand itself out a little more than the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think not necessarily,
like they could both equally be very
[SPEAKER_00]: unique?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they, they both could be very
unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, certainly there's a concentration
that happens, um, with hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think one thing I've, I've
definitely heard over and over again from
[SPEAKER_03]: hash artists, um, and extractors is they
fully have been blown away when they first
[SPEAKER_03]: like run some living soil, uh,
base trichomes, like when they've just
[SPEAKER_03]: been running salt, you know, or indoor or,
or maybe less, uh, organically grown
[SPEAKER_03]: depths or stuff with dust and all the
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, you know, I, yeah, I've seen it
happen a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, Oh my God, like what is the
quality of this?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just incredible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hard for them to go back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, most extractors that I've worked
with who've been turned onto that have
[SPEAKER_03]: been very, uh, they only want to source
that type of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that shows something about the
terroir for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just to kind of stimulate a bit of
discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't too long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was chatting with Burnside Collective
who were the guys who won the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: category of the ego clash and they did it
in salts and they made this interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: comment where they were kind of like,
we think that producing hash and
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate specifically, it's more about,
uh, like the watering techniques and like
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidities and stuff more so than
organic versus inorganic because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of getting the glandular heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think, do you think there's any
truth to that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think like- Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Environmental conditions, like never being
stressed out, having the right like
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature and, and, you know,
just the plant being happy all the time
[SPEAKER_03]: and it being the right genetic in the
first place is, is it might be stand out
[SPEAKER_03]: even more than, uh, other, other things
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I mean, I think at first it starts off
with the genetic, like, is that genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: going to put off the flavor that's going
to work out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if it doesn't, then it doesn't really
matter what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, next though, I mean, I really think,
yeah, just like not having an environment
[SPEAKER_03]: that has stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, I remember when,
uh, like simply Adam first, like was
[SPEAKER_03]: washing some of our living soil grown,
um, coastal stuff, you know, like I think
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's something about the lack of
stress in the environment because it never
[SPEAKER_03]: gets too hot or too dry or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the trichomes could really just be
what they wanted to be with never seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: any stress.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think, uh, yeah, I mean, someone
putting a lot of, um, effort towards
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental control and not using any
shitty products, at least, or at least
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that would be very, um, you know,
benign, I guess, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: people that are going to be using
pesticides or any kind of sprays are going
[SPEAKER_03]: to destroy hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, obviously it's not going to taste
good and it would be toxic and all of that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you know, some mineral salts that
are thoughtful, um, in a good environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I don't think it would be what it
could be, but I do think it would be
[SPEAKER_03]: better than a, uh, something else that,
uh, was, was stressed out potentially and
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly better than something that
wasn't the right genetic in the first
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so an issue I've been kind of tossing
in my mind is, do you think there's any
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship between like the trichome
density that you see on the plant and the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of hash, or do you think they're
not tied in together?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I bring this up is because
I think a lot of people look at like Mac
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, and they're like,
Oh, it must make the best hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, this is something I like to
bring up when, you know, like just in
[SPEAKER_03]: that, the idea of trichome density,
it's like, well, how do you even measure
[SPEAKER_03]: that?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and I would like to establish
like, you know, better, uh, better ways
[SPEAKER_03]: to, to measure that because you can't just
say there's this many trichomes that's not
[SPEAKER_03]: telling you what you need to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what size are the heads?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, uh, you know what,
just, you have to describe the next,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, are they all snaking around?
[SPEAKER_03]: And making that illusion of the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, you know, it's like black dogs
is one that's like both, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's got the long necks and it's got the,
the heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's got that, like, it can have that
super frosted out look.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you know, there's other varieties
that might even be packing more trichomes,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they, they're not, um, they're not
poking them out with the next,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, um, you know, like they're,
they're just heads that kind of grow
[SPEAKER_03]: before the next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,
[SPEAKER_03]: or then, yeah, they grow and then the neck
will kind of come after and they'll hook a
[SPEAKER_03]: bit, but it's like the plants that put
that effort towards the head, but it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: just that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what is the makeup inside that
trichome?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the terpenes and cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of CBD varieties, like why I was
talking about it, they don't yield that
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, they have like high mercine,
um, contents quite often in different
[SPEAKER_03]: volatile trips.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I just, they just don't, they don't,
they don't, they don't have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just grease out really easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You touch them and they grease out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like obviously you're going to lose so
much if you're trying to, to separate
[SPEAKER_03]: trichome heads, um, if they all just
burst.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so there's a lot of things to think
about, um, in, in the morphology and the
[SPEAKER_03]: chemical makeup, uh, beyond, uh,
trichome density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then do you think over time as the quality
of hash and concentrates in general
[SPEAKER_00]: improves that we're going to see more and
more people move away from flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, move towards concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it's just like whatever
floats your boat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Flowers never going to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like the basis for everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, even if I want to smoke hash all
day, I want to see where, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the flower came from too, and enjoy that
too, or roll a joint with the two
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and yeah, there's, and right now,
like actually it's kind of funny in the
[SPEAKER_03]: California, like legal market in all of
the markets, there's really like no end to
[SPEAKER_03]: the desire for really quality flower,
especially after the outdoor season has
[SPEAKER_03]: been over for so long and depths are just
hitting and, um, and indoor is so rare in
[SPEAKER_03]: general, especially also in the legal
market too, that, um, people, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, they, I mean, if you got really good
flowers, they, people go for the flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's still, you're going to make more
on that too, as the farmers in general,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, it's still, it still gets the best,
best price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but that's what's really nice about
breeding for yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that let's say something you're
growing a variety that yields well in ice
[SPEAKER_03]: water hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, let's say yields average, you know,
but it's good enough to work, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're, you're growing that,
but then you get genetics of another
[SPEAKER_03]: variety that yields three times as much as
that decent yielding variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just grew three times as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that same location with the same
amount of resources and the same license
[SPEAKER_03]: and the same square footage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so that's huge difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I, yeah, I try to, I want to breed
towards things that help farmers do
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the topic of breeding, something
which really stood out to me about your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding, which I'd love to chat about is
that I've noticed, and I probably wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I, when it comes to mind, I've noticed
that you do something really unique with
[SPEAKER_00]: your breeding that I've only ever seen res
dog do, which is like explore these sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of back-cross and then take it to the next
filial generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, you know, interweaving
back-crossing and filial breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas most breeders tend to stick to one
or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think that other people might
be missing out on a little something by
[SPEAKER_00]: just back-crossing or just filial
breeding?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it's all something to
explore and like, you know, I want to do
[SPEAKER_03]: both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, at the same time, because I get to see
what comes out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, and I'm just interested to,
um, in how to get to certain places
[SPEAKER_03]: faster.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes I think, uh, yeah,
if you see back-cross generation makes
[SPEAKER_03]: more sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and yeah, I like that to also like,
yeah, people are actually to have people
[SPEAKER_03]: think about that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, cause I remember like back-cross
you'd like see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like so often used.
[SPEAKER_03]: As like sibling pairing and stuff too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just using the terminology,
of course that gets really difficult too,
[SPEAKER_03]: because like, well, which back-cross is it
on?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I, I mean, I actually do note
it will be like, Oh, the 2012 black dog
[SPEAKER_03]: selection, you know, for the, that cherry
lime dog BC one F two number three.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, so I know that, but like,
um, but it could have been, but the BC,
[SPEAKER_03]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if I put it back on the cherry lime
pop or something like, it would still be
[SPEAKER_03]: the same notation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that, that kind of, I just have
to write down all the things basically,
[SPEAKER_03]: like being well labeled is, is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, yeah, I just really love to see,
you know, later on, I don't know what kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of research I can do too.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like, um, are already able to do
a decent amount and being able to see how
[SPEAKER_03]: genetically consistent something is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, yeah, being able to learn,
from what's the fastest way to achieve
[SPEAKER_03]: something in a generation of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, an interesting example that
I really love, um, and we've got these
[SPEAKER_03]: giant, beautiful, um, glazed cherry plants
in the yard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are from green source gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first time we met Nick from green
source gardens, I was with Ryan Humboldt
[SPEAKER_03]: seed organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, we went over to their place in
Jacksonville, uh, before they got their,
[SPEAKER_03]: their current farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, we gave them a bunch of
seeds, traded a bunch of seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: hung out at a great time, put my hands in
some of the most beautiful soil I've ever
[SPEAKER_03]: seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, they had this amazing little like
medical backyard grow that like in the
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures looked like the most giant,
amazing oasis you could imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the most giant pinkleberry flowers
and, um, yeah, just the total magic place.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, with these seeds, the,
the glazed cherries that, that,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, Ryan Humboldt seeds organization gave
them, uh, from Keith Sweatt's,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, work on, on the glazed cherries,
which is cherry OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a cookies cross that worked a
little bit, um, that Nick ended up taking
[SPEAKER_03]: it to, to five generations, uh,
out there and, um, in their, their farm in
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon and adapted to their spot and
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like that's an F five from,
you know, the seeds when we met five years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago, and then he'd also taken the,
the black dog BC for multiple generations
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had two very established inbred
lines that he put together and made these
[SPEAKER_03]: F ones last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gave, gave me some of these and
they're just true F ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when we talk about a hybrid,
like, um, an F one hybrid, like normally
[SPEAKER_03]: it should be coming from two established
lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he just freaking did the
work, spent five years, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's just, it's just cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a gift from when you first meet and
then that turning into this amazing thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the consistency between these plants
and the giant leaves and the, the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the vigor and everything, it's just,
it's what you'd expect in a F one
[SPEAKER_03]: generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of other plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's kind of how it's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of times you'll take something to
it, you know, F nine before, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and before you start putting it together
for an F one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a really interesting point
you bring up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There because a lot of people talk about
how if you took two really inbred lines
[SPEAKER_00]: and cross them together, that would be
like what you might think of as like a
[SPEAKER_00]: true F one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like, you know, two really
diverse things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that you like that sort of
pairing over the more like F one cross F
[SPEAKER_00]: one making a new F one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, I guess I like everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I super like these, these F ones of the
chair, the glazed cherries.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just insanely nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, they, they kind of, yeah, they're just
the standard of what you'd want from a F
[SPEAKER_03]: one generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, I mean, I think a lot of other
things I'd probably classify as,
[SPEAKER_03]: as a poly hybrid, uh, instead of a F one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, because, you know, I don't know
what the, I don't have a pedigree on the
[SPEAKER_03]: other thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also when you're just like,
which I do all the time to crossing in
[SPEAKER_03]: the, you know, a well established cut or
whatever, you don't know if that was a bag
[SPEAKER_03]: seed, if somebody did any work on that,
or if it was just a found thing or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, or, or how crazy the, the,
um, the generation was before it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't actually know, um, because a lot
of these things, we don't have any kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of, uh, pedigree on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something I kind of look forward
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really like dogs and, um, I like the
idea of like kind of the breed standard
[SPEAKER_03]: and different things being built by
breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have this information that we
can, uh, work with and, and, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: and actually know all the, you know,
I w like, when I look at a plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I get to like think about their
grandmother and their great grandfather
[SPEAKER_03]: and all of that stuff, you know,
like it, and because I, I label well,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I take pictures of everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can really go back and just know
all these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just brings me a lot of joy to have
that family history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like a consistent theme I'm
picking up that is important to you is
[SPEAKER_00]: like good documentation, good record
keeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that this is something which
unfortunately, might not be done well
[SPEAKER_00]: enough by others at the moment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, I can always do it better
too, but you know, I, I, uh, no,
[SPEAKER_03]: actually, I mean, I go crazy if I do it
wrong, but yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it all works, but yeah, it's tough
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go to these amazing farms and
they've mixed everything up and it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: like, no, like, and then we try to be all
positive and stuff because everything
[SPEAKER_03]: looks good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm like dying inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, no, everyone label well,
please, please.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes breeders happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that like this idea is
something even both myself and obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: you as well are hoping to promote because
there have been times when, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I've messaged a breeder and I was
like, Hey man, just so you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, like you should put the female first
and the male second in when you're listing
[SPEAKER_00]: the parent stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes people get really defensive
and it's like, I'm not, I'm not trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a go at you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, it's just, you know,
the convention, you know, like it's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just helps if we all follow it,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I like female first.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, the next question I wanted to
ask was, I'm sure it has happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just to, to really get the verdict on
it, have you ever done a certain cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe you're taken a certain thing to
the F2 or the BX3 and you do it and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Oh man, I think I might need to go
back and redo that a bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't quite get what I was looking
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that, does that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you find you instead maybe just find
something you weren't expecting,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's equally cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like we're just going to go down
this path.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much unexpected always happens in life.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like you and you know,
and the thing is also because you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the generations, you do know what to
expect too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I do find that quite often the
plants fulfill my, the expectations
[SPEAKER_03]: because I know their history, but often I
find that the things I think about first
[SPEAKER_03]: are like, Oh, that's the one it so often
it's a surprise at the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: So often it's, it's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you really don't know anything until
you go through the full process as far as
[SPEAKER_03]: selection goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a question our viewers always love
to hear our guests answer is, are there
[SPEAKER_00]: any particular traits that you think are
representative of a good mail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I remember just the common one is
like Subcool always used to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want a mail that, you know,
it's not super quick flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also not the last one in the pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he always kind of pitched it as though,
you know, towards the later end of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any traits you think represent a
good mail or do you think it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: variable and it depends what you're
looking for out of the mail?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, all of them, all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, what are you going for?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to work backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, and I like to have a
lot of males and, um, and be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: really choose what's going to make sense
for something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but every, but what I'm looking for is
going to be completely based off of kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of the end goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not a blanket, you know,
question like, and, and how do you do that
[SPEAKER_03]: search?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you making a high CBD you know,
you're just making sure that it's a CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: rich, you know, then you're going to do
analytics for your mail search.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you looking for resistance?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then, uh, you might want to put them in a,
in a place that's, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be the place that would bring
out, uh, molds and disease and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and see the strongest ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you might be just, it's all about
smell and just the stem rub is really
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be what it's about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, you really, you might really
care about, um, flower structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might really look at like,
what, how does that, that male flower look
[SPEAKER_03]: to, um, there's a lot of things to look
at, uh, general health vigor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so it, but normally you're putting all
of these factors together a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then paying attention to the
things that you have already observed from
[SPEAKER_03]: the past, you know, if you, if you know a
certain stem rub is associated with an end
[SPEAKER_03]: flower, like that's something you gain by
just paying attention to plants for like
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it, it cracked me up at the,
it was one of the region conferences and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and mean gene was, was talking on one
of the panels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, somebody had kind of had asked
that question, you know, and he just
[SPEAKER_03]: started talking about all this stuff and
he was describing, uh, how, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you smell pickles on that early stem
rub, you know, that ends up being like
[SPEAKER_03]: your gassy ones and just all this like
nuanced details.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of stuff that he'd been observing for like
two decades.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like at the end of it, it was just
like, the dude was like looking for like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a short answer, you know,
like, you know, what's a good nail or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, it was like,
the answer was like, well, you just pay
[SPEAKER_03]: attention for 20 years and then you start
to get, uh, uh, the beginning of an idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of, uh, so yeah, there's just
a ton of things to, to put all together
[SPEAKER_03]: and what your selection is going to be
for, for what.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you're making.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but you know, I want them to be
resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want them to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want people to struggle,
you know, um, I don't want them to have to
[SPEAKER_03]: use things to deal with, uh, mildews and
molten.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, if I can have that be part of the
male selection, that's super great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I'm not going to do that at the
detriment of like the quality and smell
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's like, still with like,
there's nothing coming off that stem rub.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter how resistant it is
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, well, hopefully there's a really good
smelling one next to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's resistant too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, actually for the males too,
you know, you brought up the like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, you just want the ones that are the
right timing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really think that all the different
timings are useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like I put some of them just to
play with it, see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I put some of like the most early males
that came out of a orange Valley dog,
[SPEAKER_03]: cherry lime dog cross, uh, onto some auto
OGs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just and see what that does next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, I'll observe that and there's
multiple ways I can go with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could make more autos with it,
or I could just have an earlier flowering
[SPEAKER_03]: generation, make selections off that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, see a little mix of things,
but like, what do you want to do and where
[SPEAKER_03]: what's your environment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like maybe you only do want to be those
using those super early flowering males,
[SPEAKER_03]: but like, if you have a really nice full
season, maybe you super want that full
[SPEAKER_03]: stacking all August, you know,
you don't want it to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, wasting, you know, and flowering
early, uh, instead of continuing to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: and stack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so it's really dependent on your,
your end goal and where you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, if you're closer to the
coast, shit, use those earlier males,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I think you should use them all
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is I, I like staggering
of, uh, harvest times and being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: work with farmers to create kind of a
genetic plan to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like if you want to be harvesting from,
you know, uh, mid late September until
[SPEAKER_03]: November, you like, then you get to do
each week, you know, we'll take down this
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we'll take down that and then
we'll take down this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, when it's all, Hey, it's October 20th
and it's all ready at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drying spaces is difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and then quality goes down.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're trying to like pack everything
in, you're doing things quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of that, and you might not be able
to save it all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, so I think, you know,
really staggering, um, flowering times
[SPEAKER_03]: makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, you know, making that notation,
which I like to do, like I note those,
[SPEAKER_03]: those first flowering males, um,
and those later ones and notate note that
[SPEAKER_03]: information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I can have an idea of the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once I see that working, then I can
recommend that to a farmer for,
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I know that, but this variety is
going to be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the first week of October, this one
will be the second, this one will be the
[SPEAKER_03]: third.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that, that helps stagger that kind
of harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I really like is for ice water
hash varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and some of the varieties,
like, um, the banana crosses, the holy
[SPEAKER_03]: nana crack, uh, banana dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the things are really, uh,
Voltron, um, which is, uh, Athena,
[SPEAKER_03]: holy crack times, um, Sapphire scout black
dog.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, those are incredibly resistant and
lazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think they're the first,
uh, they are the last, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the later, uh, season, you know,
it's like the end of October there,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they look so mature and good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, actually you could see the Voltron
on the calendar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you might've got at the Emerald
cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, on the October shot as a candid push
photo and from high water farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was dry farmed and just like just
the maturity of the crystals and the size.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a flower that really literally
nothing was done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was cover crop tilled correctly
planted and then let the winds just rip
[SPEAKER_03]: through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was let to dry and to like get like
ravaged by the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it became hardy and strong and
grew like flowers that would blow away any
[SPEAKER_03]: of the most cracked out indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll see like it's so freaking just
frosted out dense and beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but so like that holy Nana crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is a great example for the really high
resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does a thing with the flower
structure where it separates each
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nug just enough that you don't have air
water being trapped that each one is just
[SPEAKER_03]: segmented enough that it that it has a
good open air.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's already incredibly resistant to
botrytis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also doesn't grow in a in a shape
that would trap that moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that also lends better to ice
water hash because each one of these Nugs
[SPEAKER_03]: has more surface area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have the perfect trichomes for to
just large, large size heads and heads
[SPEAKER_03]: first and not a whole lot of next thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All that energy is going to really nice
heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can harvest those in November when
it's like cold and not have any worry of
[SPEAKER_03]: any mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a really nice time to make fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: After everything else is harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what an awesome answer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something you brought up, I'd love to
talk a little more about is the role autos
[SPEAKER_00]: might play in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see them potentially filling a
niche in terms of maybe little windows
[SPEAKER_00]: where other cultivars aren't quite
suitable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it's kind of a different
domain to what the farms will be working
[SPEAKER_00]: with long term in a certain respect?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, it's been slow at first,
but oh my God, it's game on with autos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fucking nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're freaking nice, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have this beautiful garden over here
that, yeah, friend Ryan had worked on with
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt seed organization and these auto
G's fastest growing plants have ever seen
[SPEAKER_03]: in my life, like just stunning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just direct sowed them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're feminized.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're yeah, there's a project we did
locally and they are just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there are some of them are above my
shoulder almost this tall as me just
[SPEAKER_03]: filling out everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: Freaking smell amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's fruit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's gas and incredibly sturdy stocks
and an incredible tricone production.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't, you know, it's like it's not
like how autos were.
[SPEAKER_03]: The work's been done and there's a lot
that can be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually looking at these the just the
stocks, I'm like, damn, these would be
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing fiber plants to like if you're
able to both harvest the flowers and the
[SPEAKER_03]: fibers, because with autos, you have so
many close to each other that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: growing so many stocks, you know,
that I could see like they're being kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of a cool combo of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because man, they're they're they're thick
and stocky.
[SPEAKER_03]: A thing about autos.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really interesting to is just how
reactive they are to their environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are metabolic machines.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grow incredibly fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they or they don't at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: They the conditions really mean a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really easy to have them stunt out
and be really small at different times a
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they don't want to be like cold or
too wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely don't want to be eaten by
banana slugs all winter long like they
[SPEAKER_03]: were here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the ones that I just direct sowed at
the perfect time for to get them to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to veg in this and and flower during
the mid of the summer are just it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: game on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ones that went right in the ground
grew incredibly fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've never watered them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just and I think they really like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to be too wet.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's obviously there's places where
they would just dry out and die.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this isn't one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can tap in and the the soil biology
is rich.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it holds on to moisture pretty
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm in an area that's relatively it's
green and it gets the marine moisture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't rained.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they they really enjoy just being able
to tap in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want much water.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they do want to be able to eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did amend them at a time like some
fish bone and the Kashi and kelp and some
[SPEAKER_03]: trace mineral.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that that's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah they just they just go.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones in pots are definitely
considerably smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: And any ones that had that were left in
the four inch pots like I did I planted a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I decided to fill in some of the
gaps a little bit more with some plants
[SPEAKER_03]: that were weak that were in some four inch
pots a week later.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know about half the size just in
that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how much like you lose every
day that that they don't get to just go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're just they're metabolic
machines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you dial it in and what works in
your place like super powerful what you
[SPEAKER_03]: can do with autos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we continue to like just cross in
awesome flavors awesome attributes like
[SPEAKER_03]: you know autos will be doing all the
different things that we'd want them to be
[SPEAKER_03]: doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know whether it's for good hash
whether it's for CBD whether it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: insanely good flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also think yeah fiber and all kinds
of other aspects are very viable with
[SPEAKER_03]: autos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just stunned with what I've seen
with these ones this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a whole other world the last two
years and autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah certainly I mean you know the guys at
Mephisto certainly really done a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: work in I think a lot of consumer's eyes
they made people realize you can do good
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and now people recognize across the
board there's there's good autos.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question has been doing a lot of great
work too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I was just going to ask can we expect
a black dog auto down the line and if so
[SPEAKER_00]: would you want to just cross it to a
Ruderalis and keep a black dog or more
[SPEAKER_00]: like cross it to like an OG auto and have
like a hybrid sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes that's being that's being figured out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But man these OG autos are looking so nice
with it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I'll be making the cross regardless
but yeah we'll see we'll see what works
[SPEAKER_03]: out from there and there's definitely
potential for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it would actually lend really
well to that because it's already got a
[SPEAKER_03]: very consistent quality that works well
for lots grown smaller together and high
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's highly likely that would
be a couple of years probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: But highly likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing you brought up which
was really interesting to me was and
[SPEAKER_00]: you've said it a few times dry farming and
the reason why I'm interested in this is
[SPEAKER_00]: because I feel like as the concept takes
off more there's more of a demand for seed
[SPEAKER_00]: because obviously clones don't do very
well in a dry farming situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that is a possible situation
where outdoor growers move away from
[SPEAKER_00]: clones almost entirely and are just using
seed because of the benefits maybe in a
[SPEAKER_00]: dry farming context maybe in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you think that they're going to
move more consistently to seed and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little away from clone?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean the market's still going to demand
certain clone varieties that's always
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be the case and there's certain
dry farm areas that can still grow clone
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars pretty pretty well.
[SPEAKER_03]: High water farms being one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in general they just grow all seed
actually these dry farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they super prefer that the way they
tap in and yeah the expression.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are a few dry farms growing some
of these autos right now so yeah we'll get
[SPEAKER_03]: to see exactly how they're expressing
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that absolutely makes it like the
dream of just direct sowing feminized
[SPEAKER_03]: autos and doing nothing on dry farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I think that's something that is very
much probably I mean happening on small
[SPEAKER_03]: scales this year and will just grow I'm
sure next year and the following years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah awesome awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I wanted to chat with you
because we recently had him on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: was the legend himself Irizen and I know
that you've been working with some
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties and you guys are friends and
have got some sort of work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be able to give us a little bit
of an insight into what you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with and what your hopes are to do with
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah man it just like made my heart sing
to hear that shout out from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just respect his work so much and
consider him a great friend and such a
[SPEAKER_03]: great friend to cannabis and just honestly
like the world really respect the work
[SPEAKER_03]: that he's doing tremendously.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's one of the most important
people in cannabis and I love him for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be able to work with these things from
all these different places where he's done
[SPEAKER_03]: the documentation not just of the plant
which he does an amazing job of but of the
[SPEAKER_03]: terroir and the culture and the factors
that led up to that you know that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: variety existing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it's just amazing so all these
different parts of the world they get to
[SPEAKER_03]: to read about the culture what you know
what they were producing you know and are
[SPEAKER_03]: these hash multi-generational hash
communities are they specific farmers are
[SPEAKER_03]: they like totally true primordial land
race and one of the the most amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: things that's to have in the garden right
now is seeds from seed plants from Low Lab
[SPEAKER_03]: Valley in Kashmir and Deepak Irizen had he
had brought these he was documenting the
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds out there and these plants growing
in the forests of Kashmir in the Low Lab
[SPEAKER_03]: Valley and he paid attention to the
pollination and the males coming out and
[SPEAKER_03]: then came back out to collect seeds and
got just all these amazing pictures of
[SPEAKER_03]: them and these are true wolves basically
like if you were to you put it in context
[SPEAKER_03]: of dogs you know like we have all their
different hybrids and stuff and this these
[SPEAKER_03]: are wolves in their environment and it's
kind of like cannabis for the land before
[SPEAKER_03]: time because it's not affected by any
other feral varieties or cross-pollination
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not affected by human encroachment
it's not affected by light pollution they
[SPEAKER_03]: just are what they are and what's amazing
about that is cannabis is cannabis man
[SPEAKER_03]: like these are still straight cannabis
plants and they're incredibly interesting
[SPEAKER_03]: and unique and I love I have a time lapse
on them right now and I like watching them
[SPEAKER_03]: at night and they like they just super
tuck their leaves down real tight to the
[SPEAKER_03]: stem and then right at like four in the
morning I mean all the plants do this a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit but these do it really extreme
they just start to like wake up and it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: total like morning yoga just like and they
already know where the sun's gonna be wave
[SPEAKER_03]: you know like an hour before it gets there
just getting into position and it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful dance to watch and you know just
right now I'm getting to see the first
[SPEAKER_03]: male you know starting to show and the
first females and there's even a pink
[SPEAKER_03]: pistol coming off of one of them amazing
you know keratin in production and
[SPEAKER_03]: anthocyanin production and like the yeah
they're just really interesting plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're ready to protect themselves you
know from the environment the thing that I
[SPEAKER_03]: find really interesting about them was
their seeds too which are incredibly small
[SPEAKER_03]: they're probably about a tenth of the size
of a normal like domesticated variety like
[SPEAKER_03]: black dog or something and they they also
take a while to germinate and not a whole
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of them germinate like quickly and a
lot of this I think has to do with you
[SPEAKER_03]: know what what works for survivability out
there because nobody's being like nobody's
[SPEAKER_03]: saving the seeds and then and then
starting them like you would in in a
[SPEAKER_03]: variety that would start to be
domesticated where somebody's like oh I
[SPEAKER_03]: like this flower and you're smelling it
and then you keep it and then you start
[SPEAKER_03]: the seeds from that that's that's starting
that work towards domestication pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly but these are because nobody's
doing that they're wind dispersed more
[SPEAKER_03]: they're like small they're ready to like
fall out of the plant easy and so they're
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of sharp lemon shaped teeny little
seeds and then they don't want to
[SPEAKER_03]: germinate before the it's the right time
of year otherwise they would just
[SPEAKER_03]: germinate and get killed by like snow or
you know the wrong climate so they're just
[SPEAKER_03]: they're well adapted like we're a
domesticated variety you had water to it
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's like oh it germ didn't like you
know within 24 hours you know and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: something to celebrate but that would be
death in the wild environment you know
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like if all those seeds germ this
germinated the second they hit the ground
[SPEAKER_03]: and water hit up then they'd all just die
that winter so it's just interesting those
[SPEAKER_03]: quick changes that happen and and not just
the plant but just right in the beginning
[SPEAKER_03]: with seed morphology and seed behavior so
that was really interesting just to learn
[SPEAKER_03]: from them and the way they germinate is so
slow like it's like they don't just shoot
[SPEAKER_03]: out the radical it's like this slow goo of
white radical that's kind of just over the
[SPEAKER_03]: course of days starts to come out and then
they grow all small and little and but
[SPEAKER_03]: when they go then they start to like reach
a bit and they have like these amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: branches that kind of swing down low and
come up and nice narrow leaves and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: sure they're gonna have a decent amount of
color and well some will but yeah you see
[SPEAKER_03]: purple and green varieties you see full-on
tricone production you see CBD and THC
[SPEAKER_03]: production so it's just kind of
interesting you know even from the early
[SPEAKER_03]: days cannabis had all this potential
stored in it and that's kind of what I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing in this too that it was all there
but what what we see with our are all the
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties and all the things that we have
now is how that relationship has evolved
[SPEAKER_03]: you know that that mutualistic
relationship that we entered into with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis like that's what's different you
know between a true primordial and these
[SPEAKER_03]: domesticated varieties is our relationship
with them but I don't know it makes me
[SPEAKER_03]: think though that maybe low lab was like
these the these early varieties still
[SPEAKER_03]: could produce all of these incredibly
useful things for humans and our medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think about dogs and how you know
like wolves are are adapted for a location
[SPEAKER_03]: for a forest for that place they're high
you know they're ready to survive but they
[SPEAKER_03]: have no relationship with humans the
humans are something to be avoided and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything but a dog is like everything is
in they're engaged with how do we interact
[SPEAKER_03]: and and bring benefit to a human they're
always studying our face they're always
[SPEAKER_03]: wanting to know what we're feeling they're
wanting to know what the next job that
[SPEAKER_03]: they can do and that was like this
mutualistic relationship that got entered
[SPEAKER_03]: into a long time ago and that became this
evolutionary shift between a wolf and a
[SPEAKER_03]: dog and all of a sudden now like this wild
animal will watch our livestock like he
[SPEAKER_03]: won't eat them it will guard them and
protect them for us I mean that's a wild
[SPEAKER_03]: jump for an animal to do they'll go to war
for us they will watch our children they
[SPEAKER_03]: will you know allow us to grow crops on
our land without pigs like rooting it up
[SPEAKER_03]: they will hunt for us though in the case
of like yeah the Saluki in Egypt like
[SPEAKER_03]: 3,000 years ago they'll chase a rabbit
down and grab it and bring it back to you
[SPEAKER_03]: like at 45 miles an hour the highly
specialized bred animals that that quickly
[SPEAKER_03]: adapt to whatever we want and like human
envision something and creates a breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: for and make selections just so quickly
that stuff happens and it doesn't happen
[SPEAKER_03]: like that with other species and I think
the difference is that there was a moment
[SPEAKER_03]: of mutualism and an evolutionary strategy
for that between humans and cannabis and
[SPEAKER_03]: humans and and dogs that it's super
similar and I think that's why they're so
[SPEAKER_03]: similar and how we look at breeding with
them too but yeah the low lab gets to
[SPEAKER_03]: teach me a lot about about what was and
what is yeah what a phenomenal answer I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean you actually answered the next
question I was gonna ask which was why do
[SPEAKER_00]: we see so many breeders also breed dogs
but they you know it you know it I did the
[SPEAKER_03]: same thing too I had a dog invasion in my
mind and I went like crazy for years and
[SPEAKER_03]: bred like the father you know had the
grandmother and mom and like yeah all the
[SPEAKER_03]: generations and I did it I made the exact
dog in my mind and it was so incredible
[SPEAKER_03]: but they all passed away now and and
they're they're in the living soil here
[SPEAKER_03]: and actually shit that makes that brings
me to a another story involving Erasmus so
[SPEAKER_03]: he hits I got the Missouri Sharif seeds
from him he'd the Missouri which were
[SPEAKER_03]: wildly they were labeled wild I believe
they have domestic feral influence because
[SPEAKER_03]: of how nice they are and also like the way
the seeds are but they god just the
[SPEAKER_03]: biggest the most amazing fan leaves like
you'd have like a plant that was like two
[SPEAKER_03]: feet tall that had a fan leaf that was
like 16 inches like longer so there's it
[SPEAKER_03]: was crazy and so these were really
beautiful plants to like have growing in
[SPEAKER_03]: the garden and our dog Ashley last year
had developed a cancer in her her jaw that
[SPEAKER_03]: just grew a big cancerous tumor right in
front of her face it was just it was
[SPEAKER_03]: really it was really tough you know just
the but she was you know she was fine for
[SPEAKER_03]: so long we you know we live in a beautiful
place took her to the beach every day fed
[SPEAKER_03]: her fried chicken and you know made every
day you know great until until it was time
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah also but um so when she passed though
we dug a grave and right next to her her
[SPEAKER_03]: mom and dad and her dad has a beautiful
tree that's growing above her and she we
[SPEAKER_03]: laid her in the ground and inoculated her
with you know good beneficial fungus and
[SPEAKER_03]: and and compost and lots of worms and
strepheria and oyster mushrooms and all
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of stuff shiitakes and had her
adorned with things ready to return her to
[SPEAKER_03]: the living soil but then she'd like to eat
cannabis and she was actually particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: good at identifying she she liked a full
spectrum cannabinoids too so she'd get
[SPEAKER_03]: those like type two almost always she's
like I like a little CBD with my THC she
[SPEAKER_03]: was just anyway so we grabbed some of the
like last leaves that she was munching on
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I'm looking at these giant mazar
leaves and I'm just like oh I gotta gotta
[SPEAKER_03]: add that to it and so there's a bouquet of
flowers and cannabis leaves that were
[SPEAKER_03]: adorned and laid on top of her grave and
this time of year her father's tree had
[SPEAKER_03]: had all these white beautiful flowers
blossom on them and they were starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: they were in the tail end of the
blossoming and ready for the petals to
[SPEAKER_03]: fall and I shook the tree and all these
petals started raining down gently and and
[SPEAKER_03]: littered the grave in a very beautiful
aesthetic way with this nice bouquet on
[SPEAKER_03]: top of it and I had taken a picture of
this before we buried her and had a fire
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know drank some tequila and cried
and and when I was talking to Deepak I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: re-arousing next he had I told him this
story and you know I let him know that
[SPEAKER_03]: there was a mazar leaf on her grave and
he's like do you know what mazar means I
[SPEAKER_03]: was like no he's like mazar means grave
mazar e sharif is grave of the saint and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like Ashley was the saint so I had
already actually pollinated a mazar with a
[SPEAKER_03]: black dog bc6 and so I put that on top of
her grave to grow the seeds and so this
[SPEAKER_03]: year I'm growing some of the um Saint
Ashley mazar Saint Ashley's mazar Wow what
[SPEAKER_00]: a beautiful story that's that's incredibly
touching I uh it makes me wonder do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think that the process of incorporating
whether it be ash is whether it maybe be
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's a dog you might be able to use the
full thing do you think that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something which people could benefit from
incorporating more because I remember I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned it to Josh and Kelly of
dragonfly and I think she said her mum um
[SPEAKER_00]: has her she's got her mother's ashes in
one of her greenhouses and I was like man
[SPEAKER_03]: that's that's what I want for me hmm well
I mean I mean from a science it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: it's impossible to say what's what or
because there's so many variables but one
[SPEAKER_03]: thing I know that uh plants respond to
love and uh if you put that into it it
[SPEAKER_03]: means something and and um and I mean the
soil beneath that plant the soil that's
[SPEAKER_03]: that returned her body is is absolutely
alive and all of the organisms returning
[SPEAKER_03]: her are um yeah doing a process of love of
returning that organic matter back to life
[SPEAKER_03]: back to rejuvenation so yeah I think that
process is powerful certainly and and do
[SPEAKER_00]: you have any hopes for the long-term
trajectory of the the the strain and the
[SPEAKER_03]: cross or is it just uh like a gift holy
crap it's one of the most beautiful plants
[SPEAKER_03]: I've ever seen in my life it's so pretty
so we'll see but oh my god the leaves are
[SPEAKER_03]: just so dark and big and reptilian it's so
healthy and it just I just love it it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just the plant just screams like love um
and so I have one that like started early
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a whole bunch of slugs eat my first
rounds uh this is a very intense area for
[SPEAKER_03]: slugs but um I started a whole other round
of them too so I have a really good group
[SPEAKER_03]: right now to um to make the next
generation with but um yeah there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple people growing some right now too
um I think actually indigo farms up in
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon uh just let me know that uh Saint
Ashley's Mazar made it into there um
[SPEAKER_03]: research uh plot that will uh yeah so I
can't wait to go go see her up there and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a couple other special friends I
I'll be able to probably see see what she
[SPEAKER_03]: does in those places and um yeah we'll see
what the future holds but man uh she's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just so pretty but right off the bat
yeah what a what like a powerful and
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful story thank you so much for
sharing that the question which kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to mind when I was thinking of that
and especially when you were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mazar and some of the Indian cultivars
is do you think that the expression you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting from this really nice natural
expression you spoke about where you know
[SPEAKER_00]: they're almost given the sun salutations
do you think do you think that that might
[SPEAKER_00]: have been lost almost if you tried to take
those same seeds and like grow them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: like a sort of a salt and cocoa
environment like do you think that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a synergy from that you're trying to grow
them naturally in the way they were
[SPEAKER_03]: originally conceived well yeah absolutely
um I mean I don't think they'd be doing
[SPEAKER_03]: the sun salutations if there wasn't the
sun going up and down and you know it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like and they wouldn't be choosing the
part of the sky to start aiming towards
[SPEAKER_03]: before because it's always the same
freaking thing right above them making
[SPEAKER_03]: that buzzing noise um yeah I don't know I
think like do you how do you feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: when you're in a a desk with a bunch of
like noise you see fluorescence in school
[SPEAKER_03]: like first like being out in the woods
like on a botany tour or something you
[SPEAKER_03]: know it's like I think yeah of course of
course it's different uh it's a completely
[SPEAKER_03]: different experience for them um yeah I
mean their environment everyone's
[SPEAKER_03]: environment affects everything and they're
very alive and conscious and um are
[SPEAKER_03]: constantly uh adapting thinking doing
things and feeling things um and they feel
[SPEAKER_03]: our love they feel our connection they
feel the environment that they're in and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's definitely way different uh in an
indoor environment than a natural one but
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean a natural one could be really rough
on them too you know they want they want
[SPEAKER_03]: to be drying out and dying in the sun or
or or in a whole cold harsh winter or
[SPEAKER_03]: neglected in a greenhouse and forgot it
you know it's like they still got to have
[SPEAKER_03]: their soils their their roots uh in a nice
soil or some kind of nutrition yeah of
[SPEAKER_03]: course they're very efficient too that's
the thing too that yeah that's neat with
[SPEAKER_03]: the low lab too like they you know you
could tell that they would just make do
[SPEAKER_03]: with whatever they have you know they they
don't need this like giant amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: resources put out in front of them like
they could grow in a crack you know yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: love that the hearty so a topic which
comes up somewhat frequently on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: is the discussion around the idea of do
you think seeds created in an organic or
[SPEAKER_00]: even better regenerative farming practice
produce better seeds like maybe hearty
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that do you think that plays
into it or would you be happy to buy seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: um that were produced in salts compared to
ones that were produced in soil um yeah so
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean there's definitely difference I
mean obviously I have my feelings about
[SPEAKER_03]: you know the intention and love that we
put into things and so getting you know
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds from someone of my favorite
regenerative farmers who have been doing
[SPEAKER_03]: this work and been breeding and and been
putting love into their their land and
[SPEAKER_03]: into their projects um means a hell of a
lot more to me than anything else and I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't really have like any extra space for
anyone else's stuff but my own so like
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just like the really cool close
people I really love what they're doing
[SPEAKER_03]: that that make it in um so uh but um
there's a lot of ways to do things and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's really a lot of like you know
let's say you're making some feminized
[SPEAKER_03]: autos like maybe that's the most efficient
way to do them I'm not going to say it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not and if you're doing the correct
genetic work and you're doing the quality
[SPEAKER_03]: standards ahead of time then um yeah
there's a there's cases where those seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: might be um desirable useful for me but
the thing is if I'm going to do something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that there has to be the there has to
be the work behind it and I have to know
[SPEAKER_03]: that like it is what it is and it has to
be like super useful um and yeah so like
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think that's going to be the you
know a lot of large-scale um farming and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff like you know they're going to need
very consistent seeds produced and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know the way that that's done um isn't
always going to be you know a farmer
[SPEAKER_03]: pulling pouring all their love and heart
into their living soil plants sometimes
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just going to be straight production
and if the genetic work is is done
[SPEAKER_03]: correctly then um you know then those are
going to be useful seeds yeah for sure so
[SPEAKER_00]: good point to bring it up I think how did
you initially get into the regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: farming movement was it just like a
natural progression or did you meet
[SPEAKER_00]: someone and they really kind of changed
your trajectory so to speak how did that
[SPEAKER_03]: happen it's it was being here um during
the time when um well there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor growing which was like you know
it's not regenerative at all but it was
[SPEAKER_03]: most like kind of college-age kids growing
indoor the arcade area and just humble in
[SPEAKER_03]: general um and there was a lot of outdoor
growing too but there was um you know the
[SPEAKER_03]: the high prices of purple and then bubba
and then og uh drove this um incredible
[SPEAKER_03]: insanity of what was possible economically
um which ended up being very disastrous
[SPEAKER_03]: environmentally um so like all of a sudden
like hey it makes sense to freaking make
[SPEAKER_03]: some giant underground you know several
hundred light grow run by a diesel
[SPEAKER_03]: generator that you literally truck tankers
out and fill next to a sensitive watershed
[SPEAKER_03]: and that was happening a lot and it was
just like well this is insane and this is
[SPEAKER_03]: all based off of prohibition you know this
is like they have to hide and we're
[SPEAKER_03]: destroying like our environment because of
these incredibly high prices that are that
[SPEAKER_03]: shouldn't exist in a real you know uh
economic uh reality that's not messed up
[SPEAKER_03]: by the government's war on drugs um it
just destroyed you know it makes
[SPEAKER_03]: inefficiencies it creates cancers it
creates environmental issues when things
[SPEAKER_03]: like that happen and at this time too a
lot of the indoor growers um that were
[SPEAKER_03]: more in town that were you know
college-age started going out to the hills
[SPEAKER_03]: and they were taking what they had indoor
where they were making good money on these
[SPEAKER_03]: uh you know varieties grown inside and
actually you know more varieties went back
[SPEAKER_03]: then too but then you know og started to
take over harder and harder of course
[SPEAKER_03]: bubba always got good prices but there was
a lot of great varieties that still did
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty good um but it was the beginning
when it was at purple uh when la was just
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy about purple it just drove this huge
um change in the economics of of the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: thing and so when all these growers
started going out with indoor tactics too
[SPEAKER_03]: and even how they're growing their outdoor
flowers and depths and stuff where they're
[SPEAKER_03]: like going to the hydra store and buying
all these expensive things that only
[SPEAKER_03]: really make sense in small grows inside
and bring it like large scale and just
[SPEAKER_03]: like wow you're spending so much money and
you're actually fucking shit up instead of
[SPEAKER_03]: you know cultivating the soil you're like
bringing a bunch of you know engineered
[SPEAKER_03]: soil from freaking really far away and
bringing it up into the mountains and like
[SPEAKER_03]: you know all this stuff like mined in
canada and sent down and then bringing all
[SPEAKER_03]: this pearlite and bringing it out to these
sensitive areas and then using pesticides
[SPEAKER_03]: and all of that and it was just like dude
this is not this is not working this isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: how it should be um and it's totally out
of balance and uh and and the thing is a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of like good people are doing this too
because it's just like what do you know
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what you know from the grow shop
you just take what you're doing small and
[SPEAKER_03]: you apply it larger so it's like there's
not it's not like anyone's like out there
[SPEAKER_03]: evil oh i'm gonna fuck up the environment
i'll do this you know they're just trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow some good weed in the way that
they know some people gave no fucks and
[SPEAKER_03]: like you know we're total assholes about
it but not saying not the case but you
[SPEAKER_03]: know some people just were ignorant to to
it or and just were and just were trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to do their thing um so i just saw this
moment where you know there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: education that needed to happen and and
change in the way people did things and
[SPEAKER_03]: what i loved about it is it made shit
cheaper and so like going to like a grow
[SPEAKER_03]: where you know they were just growing with
salts and you know using avid and maxi and
[SPEAKER_03]: and whatever extra crazy salt stuff
whether it's bushmaster or fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever insanity and uh you know and not
really getting the best results really you
[SPEAKER_03]: know it's like you're probably not gonna
you know like look kind of cool but it's
[SPEAKER_03]: probably not tasting that great you
probably have some disease issues all that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff and so there are certain farms where
like well how about we build a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_03]: of biodynamic compost right right here and
or we just cover crop we mulch that in or
[SPEAKER_03]: we just do simple things amending with you
know fish and kelp and bakashi and trace
[SPEAKER_03]: minerals and um and then uh there's one
farm too where like the neighbors were
[SPEAKER_03]: cattle ranchers too and so and they had a
bunch of equipment so they could just go
[SPEAKER_03]: and clean out their um their cattle bins
and their pens and um you know that was
[SPEAKER_03]: benefiting them and then we had this like
nice resource to work with and i'd utilize
[SPEAKER_03]: all kinds of other stuff on the property
to to compost that in and then they put
[SPEAKER_03]: that on and then saw the best year that
they'd ever seen and had to use uh i think
[SPEAKER_03]: they said a ninth of the water that they
were using before and didn't have to buy
[SPEAKER_03]: anything and had by far the best year that
they ever saw so it's like when somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: all of a sudden sees that they're like
wait i was spending a bunch of money
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking shit up like not being doing the
right things for the watershed or the the
[SPEAKER_03]: end patients and it's like all i have to
do is just like do a few things thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: about the soil um plant do nothing uh
besides pull tarps or whatever they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing and and uh and i get better results
for literally like no money spent like so
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah you know i just saw that as as
something hey i think these ideas can
[SPEAKER_03]: spread uh and they did you know and i
loved it when you know like more you know
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe a when a redneck is is spreading
this idea or a hippie spreading this idea
[SPEAKER_03]: or you know an environmentalist or a law
officer or whatever you know all of a
[SPEAKER_03]: sudden like you know became i ended up on
a panel with like the ag commissioner and
[SPEAKER_03]: the sheriff you know and it was kind of
funny it was like ag commissioner uh
[SPEAKER_03]: sheriff bio vortex and it's like what the
fuck is a bio vortex you know like we know
[SPEAKER_03]: what ag commissioner is and the sheriff is
this guy's a bio vortex um and it was you
[SPEAKER_03]: know super fun because being on the panel
and having this debate they're you know
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not debate like they fully were
you know just like hell yeah you know uh
[SPEAKER_03]: with all this stuff like that's the kind
of stuff we want to see um you know and as
[SPEAKER_03]: things become more open um it was kind of
funny too like correcting the ag
[SPEAKER_03]: commissioner on the pronunciation of
michael butanil because he kept saying
[SPEAKER_03]: michael butanil and it's like dude it's
like one of the most important like issues
[SPEAKER_03]: with like cannabis in california at that
time because it was uh that's like the
[SPEAKER_03]: active ingredient in eagle 20 and like
other things that are designed for
[SPEAKER_03]: systemic powdery mildew uh control and
they're they're kind of nasty poisons uh
[SPEAKER_03]: that concentrate really well in in
concentrate so they like so if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: making hash you're making uh bho or any of
those kinds of concentrates the the
[SPEAKER_03]: michael butanil concentrates would be very
high um and they kind of would come out
[SPEAKER_03]: with the thc that it was hard to separate
it from that and what was actually kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: cool about that was all of a sudden
everyone started failing that use that you
[SPEAKER_03]: know like like all these different
extractors just started seeing fails
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere and um and the thing is it's so
systemic that someone might not even had
[SPEAKER_03]: to use it they got clones from the someone
who had used it and uh you know you might
[SPEAKER_03]: not see uh noticeable levels in the flower
but once you get the the concentrate uh
[SPEAKER_03]: your you're actually at a fail level and
um that was a huge economic uh driver for
[SPEAKER_03]: people to clean up their act uh having
those um uh those standards and testing
[SPEAKER_03]: and seeing what was coming out in
concentrates and just how pervasive
[SPEAKER_03]: certain things were um so yeah i mean
sometimes you know like there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: like shitty things that end up working out
the way it needs to you know like end up
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing more information or awareness to
things you know um yeah certainly and i
[SPEAKER_00]: mean you raise an interesting point there
something i've heard a lot recently is
[SPEAKER_00]: this idea is just anecdotal but i mean i
think it might resonate with you as
[SPEAKER_00]: someone said to me you don't really see
bud with pm these days you just you just
[SPEAKER_00]: see a lot of concentrates and i was like i
was like yeah that's true isn't it like
[SPEAKER_00]: pm's just just you don't it's just gone
like as in obviously it's all just getting
[SPEAKER_00]: turned to concentrates um and so yeah it
speaks to the point you mentioned and just
[SPEAKER_00]: to build on that what do you think is kind
of the next step or the direction in which
[SPEAKER_00]: big ag is going to go do you think it's
still this existential kind of threat to
[SPEAKER_00]: the the the people in the industry like
what we initially thought or do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be more of an even
playing field kind of like what we see in
[SPEAKER_00]: canada where the big firms are just really
actually failing quite miserably yeah i
[SPEAKER_03]: don't think uh like i know of any of the
local or region farms that are we're
[SPEAKER_03]: planning on going into the um large-scale
phytochemical like business or into
[SPEAKER_03]: large-scale fiber production and stuff too
you know it's like these are these are um
[SPEAKER_03]: people still want craft flowers uh and i
kind of think um that those that the more
[SPEAKER_03]: educated the public is the more that
they're gonna want stuff like that and i
[SPEAKER_03]: don't really think uh the large companies
are going to be able to really take the
[SPEAKER_03]: place of that but they of course like as
far as production for medicines for
[SPEAKER_03]: biomass for all of that um it's a big ag
world um but there's ways to adapt to that
[SPEAKER_03]: and hopefully um i can get these ideas of
how they can save money in the way that
[SPEAKER_03]: they are growing and and not just have
like it be uh you know all these salts
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides and all this plastic that's a
big issue right now too there's all these
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp fields in oregon all over is just the
use of these all the plastic mulching um
[SPEAKER_03]: and and then all the the the drip lines
and just so much resources to grow uh
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and it you know that's one thing is
is people are just gonna have to do it
[SPEAKER_03]: really cheap and with less resources and
like all that stuff takes a lot of labor
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have to buy it and all that stuff
and so i'm just hopeful that that those
[SPEAKER_03]: economic drivers will help the uh
ecological um outcomes of of farming
[SPEAKER_03]: practices on large scale when it comes to
cannabis uh because i mean just think
[SPEAKER_03]: about that cost of like running drip lines
to everything of putting that mulch out or
[SPEAKER_03]: the plastic running all the plastic all
the time buying all of those things and
[SPEAKER_03]: then like all of that shit just goes in
the dump and it's like killing the soil
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's it's just yeah i don't know it's
insane yeah but really like you know when
[SPEAKER_03]: i'm looking at these autos in the garden
that are just were germinated and growing
[SPEAKER_03]: i haven't watered or done anything it's
like to me that's the future of big ag
[SPEAKER_03]: like you just the do nothing approach and
it's just like and really it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_03]: actually the breeding and the genetics and
like you know getting quality stuff you
[SPEAKER_03]: know sovereign fields and um you know done
a great job like producing seeds with the
[SPEAKER_03]: right quality for those large scale uh
applications and having the feminized uh
[SPEAKER_03]: with it which you know is like kind of
interesting from because i really like
[SPEAKER_03]: all-natural and regular breeding and
regenerate but you know having feminized
[SPEAKER_03]: super useful certain things it's also
useful for selfing and understanding
[SPEAKER_03]: different things about plants and doing
other things but um but being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: direct so i mean fuck that's a big deal
for uh less resources if everyone if you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to pot every plant and veg it and
then go it out and plant it and um every
[SPEAKER_03]: every step that you can take out uh work
or resource being used and still get a a
[SPEAKER_03]: nice production i think is um the way to
go and and and in general that's always
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be a more environmental way
because um ecological is economical sure
[SPEAKER_00]: and what are your thoughts on genetic
modification of cannabis because our
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies chimera and sam skunk man over at
molecular farms are certainly doing it do
[SPEAKER_00]: you feel like that's a bit of a step too
far or do you feel like there might be
[SPEAKER_03]: value in that oh i think there's value in
everything i just want i'm not a yeah i
[SPEAKER_03]: want to learn everything and and if
something makes sense then yeah yeah i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: not like a i can't just say you know fuck
i mean you can just pull out like one
[SPEAKER_03]: thing and then lose an expression that you
didn't want like that's great like that
[SPEAKER_03]: could be super useful um what i what i'm
afraid of actually more than genetically
[SPEAKER_03]: modified or and how you want to define
that can be different like is it like
[SPEAKER_03]: you're talking about a crisper like or i
mean really actually breeding is
[SPEAKER_03]: genetically modifying like what it just
what i'm doing is genetically modifying it
[SPEAKER_03]: through the work that we're doing as a
human um you know i might not be taking a
[SPEAKER_03]: segment of dna and pulling it out or
putting something else in um i think
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of use in pulling out
something that might give an undesirable
[SPEAKER_03]: uh expression and why not see what we can
do with that i don't see why not um but i
[SPEAKER_03]: do have a fear that uh with patents um
once you genetically modify something then
[SPEAKER_03]: that's like a really easy place to be like
i own this or something and um so making
[SPEAKER_03]: sure that we don't that we keep potential
free uh with this plant medical and
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding potential for everyone to be able
to work with it and any way that we want
[SPEAKER_03]: um so yeah my fear is more the legal
repercussions of people trying to own
[SPEAKER_03]: different things through genetically
modified work than the actual uh process
[SPEAKER_03]: because i'm super interested to see what
we can do you know if you can just pull
[SPEAKER_03]: out a little segment not a pm like i don't
know why not okay let's do it hell yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: hell yeah so just but but i way you prefer
doing it through natural selection and
[SPEAKER_03]: just observation and and working with the
plant that way i i do i feel more um i
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know that they're just that
resonates with me better but um i'm not
[SPEAKER_03]: against anything really unless it hurts
the environment or it hurts people's
[SPEAKER_00]: humans rights yeah yeah good good rules to
live by uh just to loop back to a topic
[SPEAKER_00]: before because we we commonly get asked
this by our listeners let's say that you
[SPEAKER_00]: totally in line with everything you've
said and everything you believe but
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately maybe you live in the city
maybe in an apartment or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know and then the goal is to get
to a farm one day but just unfortunately
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not quite now do you think that
there is like you can still do your best
[SPEAKER_00]: to you know do living organic soil indoors
and like is there a compromise that you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like you know you're doing the best
for the situation you've got or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like unless you're outdoors it is
really quite hard to try to you know get
[SPEAKER_03]: to the standard that you're at yeah no i
mean i i freaking i think that the the
[SPEAKER_03]: personal little indoor is just such a
oasis and a beautiful thing to celebrate
[SPEAKER_03]: um i'm not against that at all you know i
i don't like the insane large-scale use of
[SPEAKER_03]: of lights like especially in areas where
the sun's just beating there it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: like an insane use of of resources and
energy but like man to have a relationship
[SPEAKER_03]: with cannabis in your own apartment or uh
if you're in a place where the growing
[SPEAKER_03]: conditions aren't that good or just to be
able to have cannabis year-round like fuck
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah i i think that's a wonderful thing to
do and i think it is super doable with
[SPEAKER_03]: with living soil type um production and i
think people have a really good time you
[SPEAKER_03]: know doing those multiple years of of
cultivating soils you know people are
[SPEAKER_03]: proud about how many runs they've done in
the same living soil bed and you know they
[SPEAKER_03]: show how they keep getting better when
they understand certain ways of of giving
[SPEAKER_03]: back to it um but yeah i mean it could be
really simple too like just getting
[SPEAKER_03]: started off um you know i mean ideally
like it could be doing a full living soil
[SPEAKER_03]: thing but if you just want to mix some
amendments with some with uh some nice
[SPEAKER_03]: potting soil uh well one thing i like is
is pumice instead of pearlite um and uh
[SPEAKER_03]: you know getting some nice worm castings
um or ideally making your own from your
[SPEAKER_03]: compost but making sure you don't let too
many uh unwanted critters get into the
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor situation that's where the problem
comes in it's just like i want to just
[SPEAKER_03]: like be able to use any compost or living
soil and like whatever cool way that you
[SPEAKER_03]: want outside everything stays in balance
but second you go inside you know any
[SPEAKER_03]: little extra critters can get out of
balance um there's nothing to regulate
[SPEAKER_03]: them and you know so you don't want your
thrips and your spider mites and you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want your fungus gnats and you don't want
all those things um that and yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: different flies that might like compost so
being wary of how you avoid all that kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of stuff um i think bakashi is a super
useful tool because if you just mix like
[SPEAKER_03]: an amendment let's say you're using um
well a really good one is like dragonfly
[SPEAKER_03]: earth medicine makes those nice products
their radiant green is a nice one to mix
[SPEAKER_03]: in um and but like just inexpensive stuff
is uh fishbone um azomite or just straight
[SPEAKER_03]: trace mineral um you know some kind of
fish meal or kelp of course that's
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing stuff from the ocean and you got
to think about like how you feel about you
[SPEAKER_03]: know what's going on in the ocean but i
guess you know we've polluted everywhere
[SPEAKER_03]: so um i don't know you got to deal with it
i love all the minerals that is stored in
[SPEAKER_03]: kelp and um and yeah this the the
nutritional quality of fishbone plants
[SPEAKER_03]: seem to really like it and bakashi seems
to eat it really quickly and um compost
[SPEAKER_03]: teas um you know just having a high
quality compost some some good quality
[SPEAKER_03]: fish hydroslate uh and and you know good
amount of air in a bucket it's real simple
[SPEAKER_03]: thing to do um just and it's a fun thing
to do like looking under the microscope
[SPEAKER_03]: too and it becomes a whole other part of
the cultivation experience because you're
[SPEAKER_03]: like now you're actually thinking about
the microbes and um you know so just
[SPEAKER_03]: putting some good tea i mean some good
compost and some clean water and i've been
[SPEAKER_03]: using rainwater because i have a nice
rainwater catchment system put in with dan
[SPEAKER_03]: of high tide permaculture a little bit ago
um he's also the one that uh has been a
[SPEAKER_03]: big influence on developing the
regenerative cannabis farm award and and a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of uh the permaculture um techniques
that we put forward and he's been working
[SPEAKER_03]: uh with compliant farms and helping people
come into environmental and uh regulation
[SPEAKER_03]: and um compliance in the cannabis world um
sorry just yeah a little tangent there but
[SPEAKER_03]: it's awesome to be able to work with the
rainwater because it's like it just comes
[SPEAKER_03]: from the sky it's like the ph is fine
there's nothing in it and you get to um
[SPEAKER_03]: bubble up some really clean compost tea
that way um and then after like 24 hours
[SPEAKER_03]: or so then it's fun to look at it under
the microscope and see what you got going
[SPEAKER_03]: on so see if you get uh you can see the
fungal hyphae growing you can see the
[SPEAKER_03]: clusters of bacteria you see like the
forest systems that are created uh from
[SPEAKER_03]: the the um fungal networks that begin to
develop the mycelium networks and you get
[SPEAKER_03]: to see the um the protozoa like roaming
through these forests and going around and
[SPEAKER_03]: eating all kinds of stuff and like um you
know when you start to like know what kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of life is is healthy and you know that
it's an oxygenated environment then um
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a pretty simple and fun thing to do i
mean it's just some food like kelp or fish
[SPEAKER_03]: really good quality compost water and and
a bunch of air um you want to have a good
[SPEAKER_03]: aerator and i don't go with stones just go
with a straight pipe um yeah just you just
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to bubble there you go i didn't
know that one there you go i'm going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of that air stone um my
question it kind of relates to when i was
[SPEAKER_00]: chatting with josh and kelly of dragonfly
they said that when you get your property
[SPEAKER_00]: or your soil to like the level yours is
obviously at you can even start to see
[SPEAKER_00]: different cannabinoid profile expressions
when you know maybe your mate grows it out
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's like yeah you know there's no cbd
and then you grow and there's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: or like just just there's a different
profile basically do you feel like when
[SPEAKER_00]: you really get your microbes working for
you and you've got your own little
[SPEAKER_00]: environment churning away that you can get
that altered expression well again
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics is first you're not going to
alter all of a sudden see a type one
[SPEAKER_03]: variety like you know that's all thc just
all of a sudden have some thc i mean some
[SPEAKER_03]: cbd in it if it if it never has before
that doesn't really happen um and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: vice versa with a few different things
although but like you know something like
[SPEAKER_03]: cbg uh will be affected on harvest time or
or or environment potentially um but
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a certain things that are just set
into place with the genetics um but
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly the the levels you know are
going to be play you know it's like how
[SPEAKER_03]: much thc is in this one and you know maybe
in type two varieties there might be a
[SPEAKER_03]: play and uh the percentages but you're not
going to just all of a sudden see thc or
[SPEAKER_03]: cbd out of nowhere where there wasn't any
in that genetic to begin with um and then
[SPEAKER_03]: but with terpenes you are definitely going
to see some different things happening um
[SPEAKER_03]: and certainly stresses could bring out uh
different um compounds being uh produced
[SPEAKER_03]: and um but another thing too though i mean
genetics seem to kind of at least dictate
[SPEAKER_03]: what dominant terpenes are going to be and
the order um a bit but like again the
[SPEAKER_03]: percentages could change so all of a
sudden there's like you know there's
[SPEAKER_03]: instead of it producing two percent
terpenes the whole plant's producing four
[SPEAKER_03]: and a half percent terpenes and that's way
different and maybe the order is a little
[SPEAKER_03]: shifted but um the genetics are going to
dictate a lot of that so you're not going
[SPEAKER_03]: to see super wide changes normally but um
but you do get different aromas different
[SPEAKER_03]: expressions you know different potencies
different qualities a lot of the the the
[SPEAKER_03]: differences you're going to see are um and
look too you know like what did it go dark
[SPEAKER_03]: because it was colder out or did it uh you
know did it dry out more or was the wind
[SPEAKER_03]: just like ripping it or like you know
these environmental things are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: meet a lot about the the end look and that
also means something about um the
[SPEAKER_03]: trichomes and then the curing process is
just massive though that's really going to
[SPEAKER_03]: mean a lot too um you know like are all
these trichomes damaged uh did it get too
[SPEAKER_03]: hot did it stay wet too long did it uh did
it dry too fast like that's going to just
[SPEAKER_03]: affect you know what terpenes are are are
there quite a bit um so yeah it all goes
[SPEAKER_03]: into a but like there's certain things
that just genetics lock into place and
[SPEAKER_03]: they they're not going to change that much
yeah of course of course but actually i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: really excited about looking into this a
lot more and you know there are cool
[SPEAKER_03]: things like the grow off that have done
this with clonal varieties in different
[SPEAKER_03]: locations and um uh you know they actually
noticed one terpene that the hadn't been
[SPEAKER_03]: produced by any of the other of the plants
um it might have been the eagles but they
[SPEAKER_03]: um it was only two plants that that
produced in both times it was a super
[SPEAKER_03]: stressed environment they're like you know
when they asked the grower it was like so
[SPEAKER_03]: it could have been a terpene because it
wasn't in any of the others like at all
[SPEAKER_03]: not no non-detect and then there was like
a considerable amount like um was that the
[SPEAKER_03]: near dial i think that was and uh yeah so
there's a good chance that stress uh would
[SPEAKER_03]: affect that but being able to look at that
kind of those kinds of analytics with
[SPEAKER_03]: control groups will be really useful and
i'm looking forward to doing that this
[SPEAKER_03]: year i want to do that actually with not
just clone varieties but with tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: culture too so it can make sure that i
have more control on that and you know see
[SPEAKER_03]: what like a black dog or cherry lime dog
does in a few of the different really cool
[SPEAKER_03]: um farms in our areas you know showcase
like the difference of a dry farm or a
[SPEAKER_03]: forest or a mountain top with um some of
the good farmers here i want to you know
[SPEAKER_03]: doing that with time lapse too and having
that linked up with the um the uh the
[SPEAKER_03]: weather uh data collection as well which
is happening with the appalachian project
[SPEAKER_03]: there's like nine weather stations going
in that are going to be collecting all
[SPEAKER_03]: this cool data and being able to put that
all together you can do a time lapse of
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant growing throughout the whole
year and look at all the different weather
[SPEAKER_03]: uh data at that exact time and then you
could take that all the way into the
[SPEAKER_03]: drying and curing process and then look at
the end analytics of everything and you
[SPEAKER_03]: know learn a lot about those different
spots and start to build um you know real
[SPEAKER_03]: real data on how genetics are affected by
different locations yeah i mean it
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly goes to show that there's just
so much work to be done in the field isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: there oh god yeah yeah because i always
think i just my mind always goes to wine
[SPEAKER_00]: because i just think of like you know it's
established terroirs or even cheese stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that and it's like yeah they've been
working on it for hundreds of years and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really getting it in place now so
we got a while to go but um and then when
[SPEAKER_03]: you think of like the example of like uh
erasing you just had on like like those
[SPEAKER_03]: appalachians like when we're talking about
a variety that's just so adapted to
[SPEAKER_03]: growing you know close to the equator or
so adapted to being in the mountains or
[SPEAKER_03]: being you know a certain place north or in
the desert um and the attributes that go
[SPEAKER_03]: with that like that's like real like land
appalachians but then also the the rich
[SPEAKER_03]: human history of cannabis in india and
people in india is just amazing you know
[SPEAKER_03]: and like just so many multi-generational
farms and just decades or centuries or
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of years of relationships and
certain areas growing this plant like
[SPEAKER_03]: that's like another level of appalachian
you know when we're talking about well
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah we've been growing you know these
hybrids and clones here for like a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: two decades or something or three decades
or four uh it's like it's just a different
[SPEAKER_03]: thing um and a lot of the farms are like
especially in the legal thing are like
[SPEAKER_03]: relatively new and and there was a time
when people were just only growing clones
[SPEAKER_03]: too um it was kind of funny it was like it
was super weird that i had seed plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: males like it was like this totally crazy
thing for a cannabis grower to have like
[SPEAKER_03]: um like for yeah it was just clones um so
yeah i don't know i think we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: work to do to to define our area but at
the same time california has been this
[SPEAKER_03]: freaking epicenter of just being the the
current moment of cannabis like we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: you know as far as like innovations and
breeding and the culture and the hash and
[SPEAKER_03]: all of the things it's like i mean there's
just so much of that work comes from the
[SPEAKER_03]: culture here and um it's it is a a special
thing to to yeah honor and to acknowledge
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know it'd be nice for these craft
farmers to be able to have um that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: recognition um like a you know a wine
appalachian um where it's like yeah you
[SPEAKER_03]: are from this place and you are doing
these practices and you know and then the
[SPEAKER_03]: way that we mix that in with genetics too
will be interesting of course we need to
[SPEAKER_03]: do it in a way that's like super open um
and that encourages uh you know farmers to
[SPEAKER_03]: do what makes sense for their place um i
don't want anything like you know it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like we know what like a pinot is and we
know what a cab is but like you know we
[SPEAKER_03]: know about those grapes and those
cultivars but um we don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: monocultures and cannabis too we want the
farms growing lots of different varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: and we want them breeding for it you know
like green source gardens like uh you know
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding those multi-generational
operations uh on on that spot um that's
[SPEAKER_03]: building towards an appalachian and and
year after year utilizing their forest and
[SPEAKER_03]: their barnyard waste to build soil
fertility like that's the kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're you know we need to be talking
about and honoring um yeah it can't just
[SPEAKER_03]: be oh you grow this one type of thing in
this one place and anything goes it needs
[SPEAKER_03]: to be more more special than that um and
it needs to be open for for innovation but
[SPEAKER_03]: i super look forward to the way that that
the genetics tie into that because like if
[SPEAKER_03]: you do have some a special genetic you
know that your farm becomes associated
[SPEAKER_03]: with or you work with a breeder to develop
in that place like we should talk about it
[SPEAKER_03]: and celebrate it and and you know also
have some marketing power and and being
[SPEAKER_03]: able to say that it is what it is and um
so yeah it's exciting how uh to see how
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers will be um promoted i guess and
and you know the way that it will
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully um help help farmers to well as
as things become more international i mean
[SPEAKER_03]: i feel like the the world will just open
up um that full the cannabis prohibition
[SPEAKER_03]: is over it's just how long it will take um
worldwide and hopefully we just see the
[SPEAKER_03]: entire end of the war on drugs but um but
uh as that happens you know being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: really because it already is special
everywhere in the world you see crazy
[SPEAKER_03]: prices in the uk and spain and different
things for something that was grown cow
[SPEAKER_03]: and and as as as erasen also uh mentioned
too the the insane prices uh in india for
[SPEAKER_03]: really high quality uh or you know yeah i
mean what you know dank weed or whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah just going for uh just a tremendous
amount of money just staggering really to
[SPEAKER_03]: think about and and how much cannabis is
in india and how having something that
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like it's from california is worth
that much money um so that's the you know
[SPEAKER_03]: that's real perception those are real
things and hopefully it gets back to buy
[SPEAKER_03]: the best farmers and breeders and it is a
real thing that the world gets to uh to
[SPEAKER_03]: know that they are you know getting that
kind of quality um both in practices and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics yeah i mean that's that's so
important right and i mean on that note
[SPEAKER_00]: you know as we approach the quickfire
questions i wanted to ask you it feels
[SPEAKER_00]: like historically the reason why these
precedents sort of exists is because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got you know your high times and
your whatever which you know promotes
[SPEAKER_00]: certain types of cannabis and you look at
that and you're like oh that's the bee's
[SPEAKER_00]: knees however in recent years we've seen
events like high times and some other
[SPEAKER_00]: notable ones even like the emerald cup
have kind of shrunk in size a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: but we've seen on the other hand the
uprising of more kind of um community-led
[SPEAKER_00]: things like the regenerative farm award
and the regenerative farming conferences
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think this trend will continue in
that we might see some of the bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate ones get a little less popular
and some of the more grassroots ones grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in size what's your kind of predictions
for that well shit i mean i don't know if
[SPEAKER_03]: i have any predictions in covid world for
events at the moment um i think the way uh
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah some of the you know award-based
stuff yeah we'll just have to be creative
[SPEAKER_03]: this this year um yeah i mean it's it's
always my hope that that it will continue
[SPEAKER_03]: in that direction and so far i feel that
it has um you know like every year at the
[SPEAKER_03]: animal cup i just like i feel like yeah
there's just amazing talks and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: amazing flowers you know and it's um and
more awareness uh but yeah yeah i don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know what the future of the larger events
are in the really near future right now um
[SPEAKER_03]: i do like the idea of utilizing the fact
that large events aren't really like the
[SPEAKER_03]: appropriate thing to do at the moment um
and getting creative with um in online
[SPEAKER_03]: ways of of getting this kind of
information about cannabis medicine out
[SPEAKER_03]: through contests and stuff so um yeah i
like playing around with the the different
[SPEAKER_03]: ways that we can really explore something
fully because we can choose what we then
[SPEAKER_03]: curate to go online and and to um it's and
you can really dive into a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: information do you know the cultivation
classic in um portland yeah yeah i've
[SPEAKER_03]: heard of it cool it was an event that i
helped uh start or start you know i was
[SPEAKER_03]: working on from the beginning and a lot of
the concepts with it and it was uh you
[SPEAKER_03]: know the regenerative cannabis farm award
also um was a part of that from the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning too and um and kind of that idea
towards living soil uh production mixed
[SPEAKER_03]: with just really good um science and
analytics and uh it was really cool is the
[SPEAKER_03]: last two years it's adapted its um contest
into more of a like a real patience study
[SPEAKER_03]: um and dr addy ray of um smart cannabis
and steve bernhardt they um had built this
[SPEAKER_03]: this platform of smart cannabis um where
they get about a i think uh the year
[SPEAKER_03]: before was 150 um patients or reviewers or
you know judges and that fulfilled
[SPEAKER_03]: actually a wide demographic um you know of
different genders and backgrounds and ages
[SPEAKER_03]: and all of that and then um they each are
trained in sampling each one and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: space in between the sampling and they can
um fill out you know the how they're
[SPEAKER_03]: feeling uh as they sample each different
thing um and all that information and data
[SPEAKER_03]: is collected and put together and then of
course the analytics are run on every
[SPEAKER_03]: flower and then they do these really nice
posters with um uh that include the
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes as a full donut all divided up so
you can immediately see the terpenes and
[SPEAKER_03]: the the different percentages that are um
that are there and so you can quickly see
[SPEAKER_03]: okay it's a you know mercine dominant like
beta karyophylline uh number two and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you can and then there's a line that shows
all of the cannabinoids and it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: really nice long panel it's got everything
in there um and then it's got also a
[SPEAKER_03]: intake picture of the flower and a um a
resource innovation score and a resource
[SPEAKER_03]: innovation center started this power tool
that uh basically gave a um energy
[SPEAKER_03]: efficiency score to the to the operation
to the farm or or grow and then um it also
[SPEAKER_03]: had an aroma intensity score on that too
and so you they there's a whole like wall
[SPEAKER_03]: of or um hall of all these posters up and
so you can look and see all the type one
[SPEAKER_03]: and type two and type three and you can
kind of see the way the terpenes group and
[SPEAKER_03]: different things and you can just get a
lot of analytics like all laid out in
[SPEAKER_03]: front of you all quick and then you get to
hear about how the different varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: affected the different uh people in the
group and they have different um awards
[SPEAKER_03]: that are kind of interesting like one
would be the nose nose and so everyone
[SPEAKER_03]: that said that they really like the aroma
of something uh also really like the
[SPEAKER_03]: effect um and the one that was most
consistent for that got that one i think
[SPEAKER_03]: that was tropical cookies or something um
and then uh there was you know there's
[SPEAKER_03]: other things too like the most consistent
cultivar so like if everyone says yeah it
[SPEAKER_03]: made me sleepy and happy and described
like the same terms uh of the effects then
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be really consistent where
maybe something else like somebody's super
[SPEAKER_03]: energetic and somebody got couch locked
you know like um so there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: different ways to look at um you know
awards and and you know what is the best
[SPEAKER_03]: and what are we looking at and best for
who and for what you know what was women's
[SPEAKER_03]: choice you know that's another category um
and these are all really useful
[SPEAKER_03]: demographics uh for retail but also for
medicine and and also for people just to
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of start to begin to know like where
they want to start with a cannabis variety
[SPEAKER_03]: um if they're working with a certain issue
or um so i see that curating different um
[SPEAKER_03]: science-driven and also quality and uh
experience-driven um events like online
[SPEAKER_03]: could be really useful i've been having
some fun ones with uh different ideas with
[SPEAKER_03]: um yeah enjoying hash and and different
flowers and really diving into um both the
[SPEAKER_03]: science and then just the gourmet aspects
um putting that all together i think
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a cool future for it but um it's
gonna adapt and change this year yeah so
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah so that's i always have trouble with
that question normally when i work with
[SPEAKER_03]: someone it's like okay we're gonna sit
down for four hours and we're gonna run
[SPEAKER_03]: through your farm and we're gonna work
backwards on each thing and you know i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna overwhelm you and then we're gonna
work it all out at the end um so no it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like for what you know uh no i don't but
yeah um i mean for ice water for just
[SPEAKER_03]: really beautiful flowers um yeah okay i'll
just list them off let's see uh okay well
[SPEAKER_03]: again i mean we already talked about
cherry lime dog and the multiple different
[SPEAKER_03]: versions of that uh definitely uh would be
excited to for how yeah how that will look
[SPEAKER_03]: as as more things get released um black
dog is just the the good old flagship um
[SPEAKER_03]: and always available to humble seed
organization um probably yeah looking
[SPEAKER_03]: forward to some new things with neptune
soon um actually i'm just kind of been
[SPEAKER_03]: slacking i just like to put everything
together really well and like yeah need to
[SPEAKER_03]: get on that um i think banana dog is going
to be really useful for a lot of people um
[SPEAKER_03]: it just yields super well super easy to
grow grows fast crazy healthy uh super
[SPEAKER_03]: resistant um works great for flowers or
ice water hash good chunky beautiful
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers that look insane in the jar but
also yield like crazy um yeah just real
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah simple great great one um voltron has
been amazing um really really powerful
[SPEAKER_03]: strong flowers for sure uh you get that
lemon butter pepper uh and um yeah some
[SPEAKER_03]: dough and um just super powerful um yeah
there's just a write-up with that with
[SPEAKER_03]: dolphin glow had had grown some of those
other ones um the orange valley dog uh
[SPEAKER_03]: it's been really fun that's a really
bright citrus uh incredibly high thc
[SPEAKER_03]: numbers you know seeing in the high 30s
regularly had uh saw 30 before um and
[SPEAKER_03]: hallucinogenic like you know when i first
like saw i was like is this really you
[SPEAKER_03]: know and then i hit it and was just like
well i'm like in high school hallucinating
[SPEAKER_03]: like but it's like that kind of it's like
bright energy and just super strong and um
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah but the smell is just wonderful it's
total bright orange candy citrus and gas
[SPEAKER_03]: and um looking forward to what um mood
main farms is going to do with that this
[SPEAKER_03]: year and um and also uh they're doing some
of the cherry moon uh version of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cherry lime dog which will be super fun to
see this is a thing that's really exciting
[SPEAKER_03]: to see too is like the different farms do
the different versions of it too and so
[SPEAKER_03]: brycelin forest farm is going to have
these amazing cherry lime dog f3s which
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're going to be totally different
unique and amazing um they're different
[SPEAKER_03]: they're totally different paths that i was
going down from the cross so um yeah it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: be really fun you'll get these dark just
freaking cushy freaking amazing flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: from the cherry moon and then um the
cherry lime dog is like uh just so the f3s
[SPEAKER_03]: just so much bright crazy fermented fruit
goodness and yeah it's gonna be fun to see
[SPEAKER_03]: um other things uh you know i mean the the
holy nana crack light crosses and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: are just insane for for hash and for
resistance um you know i i mean i've done
[SPEAKER_03]: uh the citron is really nice the mandarin
crosses um for for cbd too um i the canna
[SPEAKER_03]: dog was really interesting and actually um
has had some really unique terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: expressions too that um have to look back
into because um they might be total and
[SPEAKER_03]: all that yeah it they might be important
they might be important ones um uh yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: good like apple lemon and and kind of
orange peel flavors and in that and those
[SPEAKER_03]: are like nice three to ones um the
sapphire sue that moon uh made farms
[SPEAKER_03]: actually doing again there's a few farms
doing that and newcombe family farms too
[SPEAKER_03]: the the extracts that came out from the
the newcombe family farms uh project was
[SPEAKER_03]: surprise surprise just incredible holy
crap um yeah some of the best cbd i've
[SPEAKER_03]: ever tasted out of a pen too they made
some in the pens what's really amazing

the peafunk uh peafunk is pretty fun
[SPEAKER_03]: actually um this year this is kind of
interesting um so a friend ryan and
[SPEAKER_03]: charlotte with uh they have a chocolate
company called aura chocolate where they
[SPEAKER_03]: do probiotic chocolates um but they're
also uh doing a uh they have um yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: really really nice chocolates and they
they really uh like sourcing the best
[SPEAKER_03]: quality um products and they work with all
the like kind of regen farms and the
[SPEAKER_03]: dragonfly earth medicine pure farms and
they've been really connected and engaged
[SPEAKER_03]: in that community and and being great
friends too but uh they also had a
[SPEAKER_03]: relationship with uh the studio where a
lot of really cool songs were recorded and
[SPEAKER_03]: uh one of those um the plant and one of
those was atomic dog and i happened to
[SPEAKER_03]: have a atomic kush crossed with black dog
an atomic dog that moon made farms
[SPEAKER_03]: actually oh sorry moon gazer farms uh got
from me years ago and continued on with
[SPEAKER_03]: and um we ended up doing a uh having they
grew atomic dog last year that uh we went
[SPEAKER_03]: to it actually meet with george clinton
and went to a parliament show and
[SPEAKER_03]: basically like he was down to to do the
atomic dog so there'll be like the george
[SPEAKER_03]: clinton approved atomic dog from uh moon
gazer farms it'll be pretty fun um so i'll
[SPEAKER_03]: have to work more with that but uh also
working on this peafunk right now which is
[SPEAKER_03]: this really bright purple funky incredible
smelling um variety that was um it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a sour bubble atomic um that was
put on skyscraper uh or sorry skywalker og
[SPEAKER_03]: and i was called that skyscraper uh that
combo and that was put onto a um was it
[SPEAKER_03]: was this girl scout a 30 selection from
2011 um that i had kept and yeah ended up
[SPEAKER_03]: choosing a male from that and putting that
onto the um that the skyscraper and it
[SPEAKER_03]: came out super just crazy funky and dark
and amazing and um this year i just i put
[SPEAKER_03]: the orange valley dog on that and i have
that like right behind me here too one of
[SPEAKER_03]: these the larger one back there but the
the stem rubs are just insane just uh
[SPEAKER_03]: unbelievably like bright and fermented
berry and and citrus and yeah very excited
[SPEAKER_03]: about those two and some of the prettiest
leaves just massive gorgeous fan leaves um
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah and then yeah it's gonna be really
fun really fun this year as each different
[SPEAKER_03]: thing starts to show because first i do
the earlys i do have some depths too to
[SPEAKER_03]: get pollinated and then i start moving on
to like the the full season early
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties and then all the others and i
can't wait to start playing with all the
[SPEAKER_03]: cool stuff from eras and as as they're
just starting to show sex right now and
[SPEAKER_03]: i'm gonna i'm gonna propagate some more of
the um the low lab uh together isolated
[SPEAKER_03]: and just to to to make more to to play
with too and multiple others um god
[SPEAKER_03]: there's so many cool treasures that he has
in there too i'm excited to see what the
[SPEAKER_03]: hunza do and uh the blocks done um you
know some of the hash varieties the milana
[SPEAKER_03]: wailing valley shilawathi it's gonna be
really cool to see everything wow that is
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really exciting that's so cool and
i think that's probably going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: people a pretty good range of options to
select for oh god yeah oh yeah i got i
[SPEAKER_03]: went a little crazy with it uh so next
year i'm gonna do a few less and do larger
[SPEAKER_03]: population groups but i just kind of
wanted to see everything because it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: excited yeah no i think it's great i love
it i love all the info um so i think that
[SPEAKER_00]: brings us to our quickfire questions which
i've been excited to get to because i i
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like these have just gotten better
over time so my first question for you is
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the most memorable cannabis you've
ever smoked in your life or it could be
[SPEAKER_03]: could be hash either um well actually i
kind of mentioned a few of them already um
[SPEAKER_03]: so the crack head that i mentioned back
when i was in high school thought i could
[SPEAKER_03]: still think of that smell it had this like
musty mango a little bit of that cat piss
[SPEAKER_03]: like linger in the air and just like just
the second you smell that you were already
[SPEAKER_03]: stimulated in the brain um so super yeah
memorable yeah i'll never forget that that
[SPEAKER_03]: aroma and effect um and yeah it was just
such a shared experience like all the
[SPEAKER_03]: friends just like oh my god like that's
just the perfect thing that you know for a
[SPEAKER_03]: show or you know going out having fun um
also around that same time that golden
[SPEAKER_03]: indica that i mentioned too which actually
became i bread it just ended up getting a
[SPEAKER_03]: purple variety which i just called purple
indica and like that had this like thick
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful earth cushy but with cotton
candy and i can just think of one of these
[SPEAKER_03]: gorilla grows right now and like you know
pull that bringing it down in a backpack
[SPEAKER_03]: and that cotton candy smell in the air
when it's all fresh and gooey and um that
[SPEAKER_03]: smell will never escape me um lovely what
what's another uh the cherry lime dog from
[SPEAKER_03]: last year for sure the selections some of
the best smells of my life um what else
[SPEAKER_03]: the yeah tasting that puppy dog or sorry
the puppy breath uh from from garden of
[SPEAKER_03]: grease it was one of my favorite
experiences of this year and honestly like
[SPEAKER_03]: the first time it hitting actually the
athena sour kush um the first time adam
[SPEAKER_03]: washed the fresh frozen of that simply
adam um that was uh yeah it was like
[SPEAKER_03]: feeling like you won the universe and got
kicked in the face with like a lemon
[SPEAKER_03]: golden boot at the same time it was just
like i don't know it was just so good just
[SPEAKER_03]: pepper and earth and butter and lemon and
just insane potency and then the
[SPEAKER_03]: cleanliness of his wash it was just like
uh it just didn't even look possible how
[SPEAKER_03]: clean it was like in the way it melted uh
it's still like uh surreal that it because
[SPEAKER_03]: that was like it was still like that's
bubble hash like that's possible you know
[SPEAKER_03]: at that time too so um that one still
sticks out to me it was really cool is
[SPEAKER_03]: actually that was like really expensive at
the emerald cup one year and um maybe the
[SPEAKER_03]: most expensive out of anything and it sold
out so quickly and i remember one person
[SPEAKER_03]: like had wrote a um uh a post about how
they went to that i was tagged in they
[SPEAKER_03]: went to the emerald cup on their birthday
like drove nine hours to uh on my birthday
[SPEAKER_03]: to go buy the most expensive hash i've
ever seen or like the most expensive hash
[SPEAKER_03]: i've ever had and then drove nine hours
back home and then like tasted it and he
[SPEAKER_03]: was like best birthday ever like and then
two years later he made another post where
[SPEAKER_03]: he pulled he'd bought two and he pulled
the other one out of the fridge like and
[SPEAKER_03]: uh and it had cured it just looked unreal
just like golden jewel of uh just perfect
[SPEAKER_03]: cure of yeah i mean it was just it was
such a pure um pure expression of what
[SPEAKER_03]: what trichomes can be when you separate
them perfectly i mean what adam did with
[SPEAKER_03]: that was art um and the way it was grown
too but uh yeah so it was really cool to
[SPEAKER_03]: see him like pulling that out two years
later like like a fine bottle of wine and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know that's how it is it's like and it
was like at that time it was like damn i'd
[SPEAKER_03]: buy that back for me for like three times
as much right now because that's special
[SPEAKER_00]: you know so yeah well there you go that
all of those sound phenomenal i guess on
[SPEAKER_00]: the other end of the spectrum what's a
strain in which everyone else was really
[SPEAKER_00]: into it and so you were like looking
forward to it and then when you tried it
[SPEAKER_00]: you were like this doesn't really do it
for me hmm you know actually i mean i i
[SPEAKER_03]: like the flavor profiles of most of the
popular varieties and stuff um you know i
[SPEAKER_03]: like the candies i like the gas i mean
those those um you know cookies and
[SPEAKER_03]: skittles and oh gee i like all those
flavor profiles are great uh i mean but it
[SPEAKER_03]: also really depends how it's grown i mean
cookies can be so terrible like in
[SPEAKER_03]: cardboard and and dense and and skittles
is a weak plant you know it's like you
[SPEAKER_03]: know it's not always super exciting to
grow but when you get it going and living
[SPEAKER_03]: soil really good it looks good i have it
crossed with the black dog right now some
[SPEAKER_03]: z dog that like actually right right
behind me if you look in the thing and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's so healthy and well structured and
beautiful and so i don't know excited to
[SPEAKER_03]: see um yeah i mean what what happens from
that because i love that flavor profile
[SPEAKER_03]: but um yeah i think certain things could
be better about the plant um but i also
[SPEAKER_03]: think a lot of these cloned varieties do
get viruses over time i'm pretty darn sure
[SPEAKER_03]: of that the the hoplite and virus is
pretty prolific and people like you know
[SPEAKER_03]: cut from one plant then they cut to the
next plant and um you know don't really
[SPEAKER_03]: have protocol like um you know even like
you probably should be using bleach in
[SPEAKER_03]: between everything and um you know keeping
your clones clean and knowing your source
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that kind of stuff um but you know
so some of those things that you know
[SPEAKER_03]: that's where tissue culture makes sense
but it's expensive and it takes a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: time so you want to do that with those
flavors that are really worth preserving
[SPEAKER_03]: um i don't know yeah i mean if a lot of
people like a flavor i probably like it
[SPEAKER_03]: too as long as it was grown well um so
like if if there was something like that
[SPEAKER_03]: i'd probably blame it on the the grower
first you know if it everyone liked a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain flavor but you know everyone has
the things that they like more too and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like um you know i'm not super i'm
not smoking hazes on a regular basis but i
[SPEAKER_03]: i appreciate their quality um a lot you
know and i enjoy that i love celebrating
[SPEAKER_03]: all the variety but certain things so you
know click with other people more and uh
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot of times like what i find myself
smoking a lot will be um the um well i
[SPEAKER_03]: really like the complex and savory flavors
that where it's like you're getting a meal
[SPEAKER_03]: um and you get that with like some of the
athenas and the banana crosses and the
[SPEAKER_03]: black dog crosses sometimes um but that
like the voltron and stuff too where you
[SPEAKER_03]: get butter and dough and lemon and pepper
and stuff i like those a lot but i want i
[SPEAKER_03]: want gas and i want citrus and i want
candy um as well because those are like
[SPEAKER_03]: really addictive through the day you know
it's like there's a certain like you take
[SPEAKER_03]: a quick snapper and it like the way it
hits your tongue and it just sits there um
[SPEAKER_03]: you know and the first time you hit oh i
remember you know first time hitting og
[SPEAKER_03]: and be like okay yeah i like that like
might as well cross that in with a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: things um because like yeah and also like
if you're you know split smokers to
[SPEAKER_03]: certain things um stand above the tobacco
and work really well and also like you
[SPEAKER_03]: know become the flavor that you want to
sing over something and to be on your
[SPEAKER_03]: tongue and um and you keep reaching for it
and it's always interesting to see like
[SPEAKER_03]: what jar like just goes first you know and
you know it might not yeah there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain certain flavor profiles where it
might be something that's like oh this is
[SPEAKER_03]: so good and i like it so much but you
don't want it all the time and other ones
[SPEAKER_03]: you're just like i want to smoke this all
day um yeah it's all different so are
[SPEAKER_03]: there well how about you are there any
that's done it stood out for you or you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like excited about trying something that
didn't like it yeah good question i think
[SPEAKER_00]: that gosh that i guess i think that i've
had some oh geez that was so good that it
[SPEAKER_00]: made others seem not as impressive and um
so yeah i think that's interesting yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: because i think the most memorable weed
i've ever had in my life was just this
[SPEAKER_00]: random og i got one time and um yeah i
don't think i'll ever find out what cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: was sadly it was just really special nice
yeah i mean like i was saying earlier too
[SPEAKER_03]: i was just like we had a lot of cuts of og
but they so many of them are so similar uh
[SPEAKER_03]: and i just honestly like i it was the
practices that really mattered because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it's powdery mildew susceptible and
like like and so like the people really
[SPEAKER_03]: knew how to grow og and make them work in
the depths and like knew the timing and
[SPEAKER_03]: the trellis in like and you know what they
needed for their health and stuff like
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just it's just night and day because
it's a lot of people fuck up but you know
[SPEAKER_03]: could fuck up og and you'd still get that
gas like singing over and they could still
[SPEAKER_03]: you know sell it okay you know if it as
long as it had that gas smell or flavor
[SPEAKER_03]: but it would be like dang dude that looks
a little small and discolored and little
[SPEAKER_03]: pm and like actually i'd like to see a
little pm on og because at least you know
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't use michael butanil on it yeah
that's a good one i like that i like that
[SPEAKER_00]: first of all if you had to go live on a
desert island and you can only take three
[SPEAKER_00]: strains with you what three are you going
to take
[SPEAKER_03]: oh man really good og cut cherry lime dog
and um probably yeah uh i would i would
[SPEAKER_03]: take one of the either canna dog or
sapphire sue selections um for like a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: two to one that has tons of flavor lovely
that's a nice little well-rounded pick
[SPEAKER_00]: there so the next question which i i
really enjoy is opposite end someone who
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not particularly fond of you've got
to drop them off on an island and leave
[SPEAKER_00]: them with three strains what three strains
are you going to leave them with the same
[SPEAKER_03]: because they need to yeah they need all
the help they can get so i love that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a very diplomatic answer i respect
that maybe black dog too because it's good
[SPEAKER_03]: for yeah you know getting their mind in
the right place yeah it makes people
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler so what's your prediction for the
next big flavor to take the scene by storm
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry lime dog for sure i love it
confident all righty so brings us to our
[SPEAKER_00]: last question and i'm really interested to
know what it's going to be for you if you
[SPEAKER_00]: could go anywhere in around the world
anytime in history to presumably collect
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or clones where would you go and
what would you be trying to grab um oh any
[SPEAKER_03]: anytime yeah i go run around with with
deep hockey razz and from just last year
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like he had a lot of cool pictures
from his trip yeah i agree but you know
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah huh it would be i also would be
interesting to just be and you know humble
[SPEAKER_03]: or santa cruz um at the moment when like
the first hybrids were kind of happening
[SPEAKER_03]: between you know something like a mazar or
afghani with um some of the stuff that was
[SPEAKER_03]: coming from south america um yeah just it
would be interesting to to be a fly on the
[SPEAKER_03]: wall those those couple years and see what
actually what did take place between uh
[SPEAKER_03]: that beginning because i a lot happened
from that moment yeah it's a combination
[SPEAKER_03]: of surfers and back to the landers and you
know um yeah both people who whether vets
[SPEAKER_03]: or peace activists avoiding the war or
trying to get out of you know just trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to get back to the land and relate to
growing their own food in connection with
[SPEAKER_03]: nature and and uh and then also the
surfers traveling around bringing stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: back and like that where those kinds of
things met uh yeah i think something
[SPEAKER_03]: really special came from that so it would
be interesting to see those those first
[SPEAKER_03]: those first hybrids who did them and what
happened yeah i can certainly get behind
[SPEAKER_03]: that so just from you know being being
california you know northern california
[SPEAKER_03]: base growing up in santa cruz hills that's
an interest to me but i'm sure there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of better answers too i would i would
love to see so much no it's a brilliant
[SPEAKER_00]: one and uh so with that in mind i think
that just about brings us to the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: things did you have any comments or shout
outs you wanted to make it all i feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: i made a good amount of them um again of

like a lot of the living soil based stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: and who cultures a lot of information the
kashi and um they made this amazing book
[SPEAKER_03]: out of it they and they ended up having
chapters about me in it um and different
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation strategies and there's one
about black soldier fly composting uh and
[SPEAKER_03]: uh but so they ended up adapting this this
incredible reference book about organic um
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation and they turned it into a
comic book and it's like a super cool
[SPEAKER_03]: comic book it's got all these amazing
little hilarious detailed characters like
[SPEAKER_03]: um and it and it really dives into what's
happening with living soil and the
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships between plant roots and the
environment and um and then goes into all
[SPEAKER_03]: these different practices like yeah
fermentation and biodynamics and natural
[SPEAKER_03]: farming and permaculture and hugo culture
and uh but in in really fun illustrations
