[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
The Podcast, a cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_01]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode was brought to you by Seeds

[SPEAKER_01]: If you go anywhere else to get your
organic gardening products or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, tastefully subtle, weed-inclined
shirts, you're keeping yourself on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this episode, we're joined by the man,
One Eye, who's going to give us the
[SPEAKER_01]: lowdown on so many different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I can even squeeze them all
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you're ready for a good one,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, a big welcome and thank you to the
Oregon hero himself, One Eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heavy days.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, first question I like to ask everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that goes back many years for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, this is going to sound
really strange, but when I was growing up
[SPEAKER_02]: in Virginia Beach, Virginia, I had a group
of friends, a few guys who were about four
[SPEAKER_02]: years older than me, and they were pretty
much my surfing buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, they were, you know, all able to drive
long before I was, so getting down to
[SPEAKER_02]: places like Cape Hatteras was created
quite an advantage for me having these
[SPEAKER_02]: older guys, but one of the other things
that came along with the surfing
[SPEAKER_02]: capabilities were the opportunities to see
some cool music and also playing Dungeons
[SPEAKER_02]: and Dragons, of all things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the summer that I turned 12 years old
after a game of Dungeons and Dragons,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of my older friends pulled me aside
and said, hey, you know, we're going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: out to the porch here and smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you care to do so?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you've got to remember this
is roughly 1986.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Just Say No campaign was very much
part of our existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I was pretty hesitant in the
beginning, but I caved eventually after a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of peer-to-peer pressure,
and that, you know, I can't remember,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember that I really got too
high off that first joint, but I knew it
[SPEAKER_02]: was something that I was willing to do
again, and over the next few years,
[SPEAKER_02]: primarily getting high with friends and
smoking joints and taking bong hits,
[SPEAKER_02]: all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, as I got older, the frequency
certainly increased.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it was a groundbreaking
moment, for sure, because it certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: opened my eyes to a whole new world and a
way to experience the world, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, how did you transition from that
to a grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, you sound like you're
quite apprehensive, so I imagine it would
[SPEAKER_01]: have taken a little bit for you to really
get head-first in, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very, very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing up during that era, it was very
taboo and certainly wasn't wildly accepted
[SPEAKER_02]: by the masses, but there was a group of
us, and we certainly kept to ourselves and
[SPEAKER_02]: stayed dedicated to the smoking of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really wasn't until my, I don't know,
11th or 12th grade year in high school
[SPEAKER_02]: that my friend of mine and I decided to
sprout some seeds and put them outside and
[SPEAKER_02]: see what we could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the beginning of several failed
attempts in the hometown where I grew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't really until I went off to
college in the early 90s that I decided to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a bit more committed to the growing
cause, and it really just started with
[SPEAKER_02]: cracking bag seeds as new things came
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then, it was all kind bud,
of course, and we certainly got to learn
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the different names of strains,
but we were just more or less cracking
[SPEAKER_02]: random seeds, primarily outdoor,
but there was some early indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation in closets while I was in
college.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then, we were really winging it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a couple of hydro stores within
an hour's drive of my college,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you certainly weren't going there for
any advice during that era, so we really
[SPEAKER_02]: had to just kind of figure it out the best
we could.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a couple of articles in high times
here or there, but the beginnings were
[SPEAKER_02]: very rudimentary at best.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did what we could, and there were
some good things that turned out of some
[SPEAKER_02]: of those early gardens, but the success
rates were not very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who were the people that you were looking
up to during that time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Often we hear people like Ed Rosenthal and
the guys who were around back in those
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you look to them at all, or you were
really just out in the ocean on your own?
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as breeders were concerned,
or expert growers or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: the only access that I really had to that
world was via the High Times magazine,
[SPEAKER_02]: so people like Neville, for example,
fascinated me and his whole story of lore
[SPEAKER_02]: and legend, but there weren't a lot of
gurus to look up to that we were really
[SPEAKER_02]: that aware of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't until later on, after college of
late 90s, that I started looking up to
[SPEAKER_02]: some folks who were making impacts in the
industry, and of course early on,
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Herrera comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was someone, and I volunteered with
normal one year when I was in college and
[SPEAKER_02]: was exposed to the Emperor Wears No
Clothes and Jack's whole kind of pursuit
[SPEAKER_02]: of why legalised cannabis is such a good
thing and why hemp was so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the very early days, Jack Herrera would
be one popular individual and then Neville
[SPEAKER_02]: would be the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing what you know now, if you had to
guess what the origins of a lot of that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind bud and by extension the seeds you
were getting from it, what do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff would have been predominantly?
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of them, one of them in fact I
can attest to specifically, and that would
[SPEAKER_02]: have been the Afghani number one,
which was so lovely donned, the Virginia
[SPEAKER_02]: Beach Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the first kind bud that I was
exposed to when I was in high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: It set kind of the gold standard for me in
those very, very early years.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were other, of course skunk was
still around then, the real roadkill
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some northern lights that would
pop up here and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would see blueberry from time to time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as the years progressed into the
early 90s, I started to get exposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: more of a variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to school around the DC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Area in Northern Virginia and we would see
things like G13 and Pluton and now we
[SPEAKER_02]: would see NL2 and NL5 and NL5 Hayes
Crosses, Black Domina.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you get deeper into the mid 90s,
the four way, which is now known,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cut is known as the Fairfax four way,
that one just about changed my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was, so this was right around 96 now
that I was fortunate enough to be in close
[SPEAKER_02]: proximity to the group who was responsible
for producing those very early four way,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Fairfax four way plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that strain, when it hit our scene,
just dominated the scene and it became the
[SPEAKER_02]: standard by which we judged everything
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really the strain that got me
into eventually exploring the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: concept of breeding and creating new
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of set myself out on a mission to
kind of meet or beat the four way,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was a daunting task at that part of
my career.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we eventually got there after several
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was definitely a game-changing
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And many others followed after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We eventually got into the white line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the white widows and white rhino,
the great white shark, some of those come
[SPEAKER_02]: to mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're getting a little deeper into the
90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, it wasn't until I
moved out west that I actually was exposed
[SPEAKER_02]: to things like OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we're getting later into
the mid 2000s at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had, I'd say when I was in that
Northern Virginia area, just due to
[SPEAKER_02]: location, there was quite an interesting
scene going in and around that area with
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty high quality cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind the Canadian influence,
which was certainly present at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we really sought to source the best
domestic that we could find at that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're attempting on the side to
produce some decent cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many different avenues we could jump
off into.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing that came to mind though,
you must have been friends with Mr. Bob
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemphill for quite a while then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've known each other for a couple of
decades now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've definitely gone and seen some fish
shows back in the day together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: He and I, and this will be a great example
of how deep the code went back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back in those days, in the early days,
especially back in Virginia, neither one
[SPEAKER_02]: of us ever once had the conversation about
growing, even though we were both actively
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating and probably knew each other
were, but it was just so tight back then
[SPEAKER_02]: that you just didn't want to breach the
subject because you didn't want someone
[SPEAKER_02]: else to really know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he has forever, since those days,
been an amazing, just incredible,
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of respect for not only his
ability to preserve genetics and keep them
[SPEAKER_02]: over the years, but also as a cultivator,
he is really spectacular in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, if we just touch back to a
point you made yourself, the VA scene,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more you learn about it, the more it
seems like this place was like the mecca
[SPEAKER_01]: of weed back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think contributed to being
such a hotspot?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was a desire at that point
in time, at least for the circle of folks
[SPEAKER_02]: that I ran with, which overlaps a lot of
these other Virginia breeders and growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: is there was a need for self-sufficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't always want to rely on what was
coming in next on what load or whatnot,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we certainly didn't want to all sit
around and have to consume Canadian.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's a lot of rural country,
especially in southwestern Virginia,
[SPEAKER_02]: Floyd County comes to mind, that was
always a mecca for just incredibly grown
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you find even in the Richmond scene,
there's a lot of really important,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my opinion, important breeders and some
of these kind of gurus of the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: that all hailed from the dominion state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it's quite remarkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, maybe it was something in
the water, who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: But for us, it came out of
self-sufficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't want to have to rely always on
others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we set forth to do our own thing and
produce our own cannabis, even if it was
[SPEAKER_02]: small amounts, and a lot of it was just
headstache.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't, at that time, necessarily
producing for production on a commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: level or anything close to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was always pleasant to know that
you had a nice headstache of nicely grown
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis with great flavor and stupendous
highs, and you didn't have to rely on Mexi
[SPEAKER_02]: Brick or Canadian.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your point is, and I think about this
a lot, about how many of these great
[SPEAKER_02]: individuals have hailed from the home
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's kind of perplexing to see it
all happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think VA in New York is where a lot of
the best stuff and best breeders have come
[SPEAKER_01]: from, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sorry to anyone who's not from
there, if you're about to hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, another thing you brought up,
which is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to quickly ask this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you get any of that VA Super Skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the Super Skunk was
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely available, and I do remember
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you talk about, as soon as we
got into that four-way era, it really
[SPEAKER_02]: became difficult for other varieties to be
memorable, just because it was so many
[SPEAKER_02]: things for Scott to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the VA Super Skunk is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not enough nice things that I
could say about that strain, and I applaud
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone who pursues it during this era,
because it's a special strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another one with the VA tag in the
name, you referenced it, the VA Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's interesting about this one
is it's actually making quite a comeback.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notably, Duke Diamond's worked in some of
his most recent lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's interesting about this one
is for the people who haven't seen or
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked it in real life, I think it would
really catch you off guard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way I felt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was nothing like what I expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't smell like what I expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high was nothing like what I expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew it was going to be good,
but it was like a... How do you feel about
[SPEAKER_01]: that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's really... I think it's the
real anomaly, and I'd love to hear
[SPEAKER_01]: Europeans on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a great one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Virginia Beach Afghani is a standout
for me for one specific reason,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost has, to me, almost like a minty
note to it, and there is something so very
[SPEAKER_02]: distinct about it that it's certainly one
of those strains that if you smoke it once
[SPEAKER_02]: or twice, you'll know it forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants aren't highly... And from what
I remember, and of course, going back many
[SPEAKER_02]: years to the Virginia Beach days when our
friends were cultivating it, it was all
[SPEAKER_02]: closet cultivated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these were smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't yield an incredible amount,
but what came out of that was an
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible high.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it is almost mind-numbing and a
flavor that is just remarkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it does have that kind of slight
gany kind of hash plant taste to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like I said, there's something almost
like a minty note in it that makes it
[SPEAKER_02]: unmistakable every time, and I was...
Actually, at the Emerald Cup this year,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I saw that Duke Diamond was breeding
with the gany skunk, with the granny skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever, I was so excited to see that
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't resist and certainly grabbed
some for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, that's an homage to the old days,
and like I said, that gany is just nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it else in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the one thing that I picked up on
for me at least was that mintiness you
[SPEAKER_01]: speak of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's one of the many
components to that Jack Harrah flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I found really weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was really one of the more
tropical... Maybe not tropical,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It had a lot of body to it for an Afghani,
and it just took me back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I found was the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I'm just going to quote Dookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, it's almost like paranoia
inducing it so wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not typical of an Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think strong Indicas would do the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd chill you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that hopefully everyone gets to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: The final thing I want to loop back on
quickly, you mentioned the Northern Lights
[SPEAKER_01]: and the blueberry being some of the other
ones around at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of all those ones that you do think
back on, what's the most memorable for
[SPEAKER_01]: you?
[SPEAKER_02]: G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't hear a lot of that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it about the G13 that you liked?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real G13, and it's a complex one to
try to describe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a very distinct taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed the high.
[SPEAKER_02]: The G13 that we were getting back then
actually was coming from San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a bag seed of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is why I like it so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a bag seed out of it and grew a
plant of it outdoors in Northern Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the only plant I've ever grown in
my life to actually have the magenta
[SPEAKER_02]: pistols, which when the flower was dried
and cured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: G13 itself has that almost grayish green
tone to it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a lot to do with the trichome
coating.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can imagine that grayish green
color with coating and trichomes and these
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful purple hairs that are interlaced
in it, it turned out to be one of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful flowers I've ever grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then just the complexity of flavor of G13
is another one that
[SPEAKER_02]: the genetics that really get to me are the
ones that have multiple layers of flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something on the inhale, something else on
the exhale, and then those flares continue
[SPEAKER_02]: to evolve even after the exhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, the standout strains, even going
back in time, are the ones that had that
[SPEAKER_02]: same quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: G13 certainly has that same quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just touched on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you popped a bag seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the first strain you ever grew?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some seeds that we had gotten
out of what was supposed to have been ...
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then it was just called purple haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows really what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were probably some of the first
seeds that we cracked where I actually had
[SPEAKER_02]: successful plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were actually indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there was also a Durban poison back
then, but that wasn't bag seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually purchased from a friend
of mine who went over to Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_02]: brought some seeds back.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some Durban poison back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was the purple haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was once a bag seed from a
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We squirt some blueberry in 95 after a
fish show outside the spectrum in
[SPEAKER_02]: Philadelphia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what the actual crosses were?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole fun of bag seeds back in
the day is you knew pretty much what the
[SPEAKER_02]: female was, but had no idea what created
the seed in that female.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, nobody was sending lineage
information with the cannabis that we were
[SPEAKER_02]: receiving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just going back, I'm pretty sure it was
the purple haze and then the Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those would have been the very first ones
that were successfully grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then after that, I wish back in those days
I kept better notes, but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't certainly thinking about
recording anything on paper back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been way too risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: All too common of an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You referenced that the four-way was one
of the things which inspired you to start
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, what was your first
ever breeding project?
[SPEAKER_02]: The very first one, and I'm going to skip
to the second or third because it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: one that really made a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was an NL5 haze that I had at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there was some big bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a big bud male that was used to
pollinate the NL5 haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be the first cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you have to keep in mind,
bear in mind here, these are names that
[SPEAKER_02]: were given to strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those days, I have to be very blunt
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's anybody's guess what it really was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it came out of a seed pack,
it was very hard to validate anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't tell you how many flowers we saw
that were called skunk that certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't skunk or even for that matter,
northern lights that weren't truly
[SPEAKER_02]: northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just blanket labels given to
whatever looked good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That first very successful one was the NL5
haze big bud cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually the one that I had sent
back to Virginia to a friend of mine who
[SPEAKER_02]: gave me the two thumbs up as good as the
four-way.
[SPEAKER_02]: From that point forward, I really didn't
want to slow down the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I got the gold stamp approval from my
buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: From there, I started playing around with
silver pearl in the late 90s and another
[SPEAKER_02]: strain called KC36, which was from KC
Brains in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The silver pearl I had was a cut female
that was from a Sensei seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: KC Brains pack of seeds that I got
provided to me in very interesting mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked with that one in the late 90s and
developed a strain that I called PROOF.
[SPEAKER_02]: Due to the silver pearl content,
it was a strain that finished up in about
[SPEAKER_02]: 47 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: We called it PROOF just because to prove
that things didn't have to go eight or
[SPEAKER_02]: nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit, just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The PROOF was something that I worked
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only genetic that I've ever
taken to an F3.
[SPEAKER_02]: It became also a foundation that I have
built off here over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever I want to induce a short
flowering period, I can generally crack
[SPEAKER_02]: one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, the PROOF seeds are
somewhat homogenous.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very predictable in what they'll
actually grow out to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have a good male donor, then I can
throw that onto a PROOF female.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I've got a good PROOF male,
then I can throw that onto something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cross was one that made me very happy
for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as we get into the early 2000s,
really right around 2004, 2005,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's when more breeding happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the breeding that I have done in
the past has been intentional S1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: There have been some true breeding
projects, but those are a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: recent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes S1s get a bad rap from some
folks, but I think some of the greatest
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics we've seen on this planet are
generally a result of S1 situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely a topic I'd love to get
into in just a moment, but I just want to
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly draw you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You reference Casey Brains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really, really obscure breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing I am most interested in him is
that the collective, whoever it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: or whoever they were, they're notable
because they never released the
[SPEAKER_01]: information around any of their strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet, at the time, they were still regarded
as very good breeders, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought, it's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a polarization because you could
never be successful in today's market
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet, I guess it goes to show it wasn't a
concern back in the time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I remember, lineages weren't
something that we were overly concerned
[SPEAKER_02]: about in the early days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that the KC36 ... Years have gone
past.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gone and tried to look up as much as
I could on it, but I haven't really been
[SPEAKER_02]: able to find much of anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that era, he's simply giving the label
to the strain during however old he was
[SPEAKER_02]: that year.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 36 is the strain he created when he
was 36 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was not necessarily something that I
was even aware of that people were really
[SPEAKER_02]: that concerned about back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the lineage here?
[SPEAKER_02]: More important to folks was, what kind of
flower is this going to produce?
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, do you think that a
lot of the stuff was quite inbred,
[SPEAKER_01]: or do you think it had a diverse variety
within it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that really has a lot to do with
the commitment level of the breeder back
[SPEAKER_02]: then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone like DJ Short, he's stabilized.
[SPEAKER_02]: His blueberry line was an F4, F5 across
the one that's touted now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a predictable strain at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone like that has worked with the
genetics over year and year and year to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to homogenize the outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, then there were also a lot of F1s
that get out there in the world,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're going to see a ton of diversity
from those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it goes back to the breeder and
how important it was to that particular
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder to stabilize that genetic for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really think that it had anything
to do with the company so much as just the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder and how committed they were to
trying to create stability in the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: The further you get the F1, 2,
3, and 4, and 5, and the deeper you get
[SPEAKER_02]: into that, certainly the more stable the
genetic comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, that generally reduces the
diversity as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something you referenced earlier,
just a second ago, in fact, was sensi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some of the seeds that were
popular at one point when you were buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also referenced Neville, so golden
segue for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a bit of a weird question,
a little bit controversial, but at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time, it's so obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe that it's even a bit of a
weird thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sensi went to shit at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you think that happened,
and who's responsible?
[SPEAKER_02]: I really feel like Sensi took the fun out
of genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of that had to do with
trying to make their seed outcome more
[SPEAKER_02]: marketable based on what they thought
people liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first genetic that certainly comes to
mind here is something like the skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all agree that Sensi's the one that
added sweetness to skunk one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That original roadkill skunk wasn't a
sweet tasting strain at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was offensive in some respects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sensi certainly produced a skunk one that
had a very sweet note to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That to me ruined that strain forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think Sensi did is they took
a lot of diversity out of the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did that over the years too because I
feel like they continued to further try to
[SPEAKER_02]: stabilize the strain so that they could
create something that was predictable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know that that which is
predictable is all that much fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when it comes to something like
cannabis and growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of the fun of growing from seed is
exploring the depths of what that strain
[SPEAKER_02]: can produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: If what's important to you is a marketable
strain or a marketable seed pack and you
[SPEAKER_02]: want stability and you want something
predictable, it waters it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they did a very good job of
watering down a lot of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're on the general topic,
if we do look back at all the companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that have existed throughout time,
which one do you think was the best?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Sativa Seed Club, if I'm looking
back in time a little bit, I think they
[SPEAKER_02]: brought forth some very, very important
genetics to the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that they also provided us with
some of the foundations that a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: really popular strains now are built off
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I look to more recent times,
when I was still going over to Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the 2000s, I really had
[SPEAKER_02]: a general love for TH seeds for Adam
Dunn's group.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought some of the strains that they
were ... I really loved his MK Ultra,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially before it was feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think something changed beyond the
obvious?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had gotten some MK Ultra seeds over in
Amsterdam before it was feminized.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a particular chemo bar that is
just straight mothballs and I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a complex, deep smelling flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, the mothballs comes to mind
first on the nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a phenomenal hash maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fell in love with that particular
selection and I had a friend go back over
[SPEAKER_02]: to Amsterdam a couple years later and
bring back some of the feminized version.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we saw fairly consistently out of
that was it had a light purplish hue to it
[SPEAKER_02]: and had this sweeter note that overpowered
anything that was chemical or fuely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't as exciting as the version,
as the chemo bar that we had seen come out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the pre-feminized days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genetics have always been Wisse's G13
and OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I love you Adam, but that's never
made sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you make regular seeds with two
clone onlys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know if there was a reversal
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is somewhat possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe there was access to the G13 seed
somewhere in that vault.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly enough, if I think back on
it, I can see both genetics in that
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely see the OG Kush in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can taste the OG Kush in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little bit of that earthiness
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's something I've never really
given too much thought to.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I can think of is either
there was something going on with the G13
[SPEAKER_02]: or perhaps something was reversed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which little colloidal silver,
who knows, but that's just going to create
[SPEAKER_02]: S1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to hear his answer on that
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot to ask him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we'll find out one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take a step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll wind down a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something which everyone remembers fondly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your first experience with the
ChemDog?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that definitely goes back to the
East Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely at a fish show.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was definitely at Hampton Coliseum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to remember what year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was 97 probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a friend of mine who had packed a
nice glass bowl and passed it to me during
[SPEAKER_02]: the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one explosive hit back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was just nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing that at that point had even come
close to that super chemical fuel taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one changed the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was interesting because I knew of Chem
back in the day but I knew him only as a
[SPEAKER_02]: glass blower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The connection to the genetic had not been
made at that point for me at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't until years later that I
actually made that connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: That flower was just phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never forget the nose burn and the
eyes watering and just how it hit the
[SPEAKER_02]: frontal of the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kicked your body temp up about two
degrees just about immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like taking the first dab you
ever take.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole new experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have really the opportunity to
find out where it came from or purchase
[SPEAKER_02]: any or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had that experience in the 90s and then
it wasn't until I moved out west and then
[SPEAKER_02]: met a few friends and some folks who were
growing one version or another that we saw
[SPEAKER_02]: more of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was definitely one memorable bowl
hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that was the 91?
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point of my career, I'm pretty
sure it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it was the D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, nobody was really running some
of the others at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It certainly was way too early for the
four which we'll of course talk about that
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, yes, I'm pretty sure that
was the 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was about to say that that temperature
one got me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always get crushed by that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one me and my friends love to
say is you get sweaty feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might have to use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, uncomfortably high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't I know about that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hard question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which out of all the cam cuts is your
favourite?
[SPEAKER_01]: And just know if you say cam four,
you are dead to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can we sidebar for a second?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sidebar for a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been this whole thing where
I've had to change up the genetics on dog
[SPEAKER_02]: walker, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you're aware of this,
but I did it on Instagram, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for many years, I was under the
impression that I had the 91 and it turns
[SPEAKER_02]: out it's the four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now going back to the 91, now that I have
gone back and resampled it, 91 is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: my favourite.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't mind the four.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's certainly been a good foundation for
me to breed with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 91 is going to be my favourite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying you're half dead to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only half dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only half dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish I could say I think it's
deplorable, but I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been good to me and I certainly can't
complain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, somewhere hiding in that
genome is a whole lot of gas because it
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly has shown off in some of my
offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get this weird betadine taste from it,
like iodine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess just to kind of summarise for
people who maybe missed what we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about there, I guess the reason
why that's important is because you've
[SPEAKER_01]: gone on to create a few very well-known
strains using your cut, which you thought
[SPEAKER_01]: was 91 turns out to be the number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's the reason why maybe
it's a little more relevant that that post
[SPEAKER_01]: was made.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to essentially explain it for
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I put up a post saying, hey,
everyone, just so you know, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we thought that the dog walker was 91
cross Albert Walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually the chem four cross Albert
Walker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's on the same page now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the first thing is that that
obviously suggests that the chem was the
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen donor in the Albert Walker,
sorry, in the dog walker, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a game of selfing genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really starts off with what I call
the AWOG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually an Albert Walker OG cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So going back to, we got the OG here in
Portland, the OG Kush in 04.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in 05, I had a plant that selfed,
and all I could find was a single pollen
[SPEAKER_02]: spike.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I plucked that spike, and a lot of
people have a hard time believing this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this is God's honest truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plucked a little spike, put it in a little
tin, put it in my fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And later that summer or fall,
summertime, had the Albert Walker plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and decided to take that little bit of
pollen on a little tiny paint brush and
[SPEAKER_02]: just dust a branch of the Albert Walker
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that little process yielded a measly
six seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got four of those to crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually lost two of the seeds somehow,
but four of those were cracked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went with the most vigorous one that
showed a pre-flowered female.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one ended up selfing itself in
somewhere around week three.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of went through this process
where I'm pulling pollen spikes and trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep up with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, certain things got pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That plant got pollinated and that
produced about 200 seeds, which we called
[SPEAKER_02]: the AWOG, Albert Walker OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: The AWOG, I decided again to revive it
some years later, right around 2009,
[SPEAKER_02]: and had, at that point, had just acquired
the, what we now know was Chem IV plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the AWOG, I was growing two AWOG,
two different AWOG plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them was just a beast and super
stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one turned out not to be so
stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she then spit onto the Chem IV.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I actually collected some of her
stamen and kept that in a little container
[SPEAKER_02]: that I later used to create another strain
called the Wok, crossing it with Forum
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we do have here, admittingly,
is a lot of instability but very
[SPEAKER_02]: intentional uses of those unstable plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it came time to crack the dog
walker seeds, the original cracking,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was just, I had a few hundred of the
seeds and we cracked about 10 of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And knowing that they, no males were gonna
get produced out of this project,
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided to look at, I think there were
four particular ones that were growing
[SPEAKER_02]: really nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We liked the stem rub, the odor that came
off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of those was a bit muskier,
if you will, than the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one was just selected and I ran
with that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you have is the Albert Walker,
the dog walker OG actually selfing onto
[SPEAKER_02]: the Chem IV plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how we got the original and
current dog walker seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess what might be surprising
out of that whole story is that the dog
[SPEAKER_01]: walker OG is not regarded as an unstable
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree with that or do you think
it does throw pollen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so here, so one of the things we saw
very early on, and this is only in the
[SPEAKER_02]: first, probably year, year and a half of
its existence was that it did not,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was very hypersensitive to over
saturation with light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in the very early days,
there were a couple of us who experienced,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you got to remember in the early days,
there's only eight gardens that are
[SPEAKER_02]: running the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a couple of us were seeing this
phenomenon where it would try to self kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of towards the end of the round.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so believe it or not, I think it was
my friend of mine out at Heroes of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Farm who decided to pull his lights back
another 12 inches or something like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: went from like 24 inches to 36 inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is under single ended thousand watt
lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden that issue went
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of went, word went around the
small group of, hey, she gets over
[SPEAKER_02]: saturated pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back your lights off, it'll prevent any of
these issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since that era, I have yet to see a
single unstable response from that plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly don't hear lots of murmurs
about that being, about it being unstable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever there, whenever someone calls or
contacts or comes in the store to ask me
[SPEAKER_02]: about growing it, the first recommendation
I make is put her on the perimeter if you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't raise your lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: She does a lot better on the perimeter
around and splash over crossover zones
[SPEAKER_02]: than she does directly under in the
crossover.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a perimeter plant for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or get those lights up high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, the dog walker OG,
it's really kind of gained itself a cult
[SPEAKER_01]: status along with the scooby snacks,
which we'll get into shortly.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think that happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like what do you kind of
attribute it to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think there was, you know,
like the right people were growing it at
[SPEAKER_01]: the right time type of thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Full disclosure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was all intentional.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was during a time here in Oregon
where some of the best cultivators that I
[SPEAKER_02]: knew were starting to have to take less
and less and less, you know, chipping away
[SPEAKER_02]: at the bottom line of what they were
getting for their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was also right at the beginning of
the cookie craze, so 09.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd been down in Northern California
at a friend's farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got, he showed me the cookie and he was
explaining like, oh, people pay,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a thousand, $2,000 a cut for
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get, you know, top end at all the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I, you know, when I sampled the
plant, I mean, it was, it was amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was like, what, what gives,
you know, what is the driving force behind
[SPEAKER_02]: the craze?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, well, just, you know,
it's really hard to get a cut of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really limit the release.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I came back here to Oregon and
thought about that a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, you know, if, if there's some
way somehow to come up with something here
[SPEAKER_02]: that you know, I could create,
give to a limited number of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: we control the release of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't give it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's good enough, perhaps we can
kind of start this same kind of craze here
[SPEAKER_02]: in Oregon, just with an Oregon produced
genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that time had the chem four,
there was the selfing of the a log.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this could be the cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really a stroke of luck that
the, the, you know, the came of our,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we selected was the one that is out
and available today.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as we finished that plant,
that first, you know, bong head of it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we know we have something here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did a limited release to eight other
growers that I knew in the area that were
[SPEAKER_02]: all friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we kind of had a powwow.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this is the plant here is what
it's worth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't take anything less than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't give out cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was also very during the very first
early days of our quasi dispensary system
[SPEAKER_02]: here in Portland or medical dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were only a couple at that point,
just two or three that were definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: operating very much in the gray.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if these places wanted
this, this is what it costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if there was everything else was
significantly cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we kind of stuck to our guns and that,
that project worked great for about 18
[SPEAKER_02]: months.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, cuts were stolen and
partnerships fractured and people got,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to this day, you know, it still is a
crowd pleaser.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for me personally, it's still a
strain that I never get bored or tired of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, it's, it's kind of
legend and lore was born out of trying me,
[SPEAKER_02]: my attempt to give something back to my
friends, to give them an opportunity to do
[SPEAKER_02]: a little better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it came from a good place, but it was
certainly an exercise in market
[SPEAKER_02]: manipulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like that is a negative thing
in the cannabis industry, given it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: rampant in other industries?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a growing movement in Australia
that you know, people want everything to
[SPEAKER_01]: be as cheap as possible or that type of
thing because they're like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, no one can see that like,
there's obviously a literal business side
[SPEAKER_01]: of things as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's an interesting thing because
it's like, people almost think that all
[SPEAKER_01]: the regular rules don't apply to cannabis
because it's for some people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's more than just a recreational thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of altruistic dreamers in
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, this is now and
has been for many years, people's
[SPEAKER_02]: livelihoods.
[SPEAKER_02]: There, you know, we've certainly watched
here in our state prices go from,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 3000 and this is going,
you know, like in the medical market,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, you know, and now the rec
market and medical market, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but people years, just a few years ago,
getting upwards of $3,000, $3,200 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're having to settle for,
you know, 1200, 1400 for the same quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not that it costs any less to
cultivate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You certainly have to figure out how to
survive in a lower margin market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you know, I, I think it has
great value and I think it should,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, eventually the boutique side of
this industry, and then I'm speaking more
[SPEAKER_02]: for, you know, our state at this point,
the boutique side of the industry and the
[SPEAKER_02]: mass cultivation side of the industry will
separate and there will be added value and
[SPEAKER_02]: value given higher value given to boutique
produced cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now that is, there's, there's no
dichotomy there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just no separation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are, at least there's very little.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that it's important to have,
to place greater value on cannabis that is
[SPEAKER_02]: produced with great thought, great
passion, intense work, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not total automated systems and so forth
and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, I kind of, I don't think,
you know, it should be the cheapest thing
[SPEAKER_02]: in the world because once again,
for a small producer, that's, that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: death sentence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it should be, you know,
I think it should be a free market to
[SPEAKER_02]: where there's opportunity for all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that I like is not taking
any personal stabs, but I find a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the people making these broad types of
claims are generally people who still buy
[SPEAKER_01]: into that whole bullshit of like,
you know, like Gucci brands and they want
[SPEAKER_01]: a Mercedes car.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, Oh, so you want, you want
premium everything else, just not premium
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll pay, you'll, you'll buy a,
you know, $4,500 handbag for your lady,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you don't want to pay more than $5 a
gram for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I, when I first so one of
my first dispensary experiences in
[SPEAKER_02]: Portland was at a place here that had kind
of a farmer's market style approach and
[SPEAKER_02]: you pay a booth fee each day and you could
sit there and, you know, pass out your
[SPEAKER_02]: wares.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it used to amaze me how many people
came in, you know, under the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: program and they'd want to sit there and,
you know, go to the smoking room and roll
[SPEAKER_02]: a blunt up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then every so often, you know,
somebody would actually come in in a
[SPEAKER_02]: wheelchair or someone would actually come
in who's going through chemo and needs
[SPEAKER_02]: help getting through the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just such as a stark contrast
between, you know, the people who really
[SPEAKER_02]: needed the medicine and then the people
who just kind of wanted the medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and I, you know, look,
I make no, I make no ill claim to anyone
[SPEAKER_02]: who just wants to smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's primarily my, my take on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the, you know, for those,
for those folks that really need the
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine, there should be programs for
those individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just, there's, you know, the way the
state hands out the medical cards,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's kind of hard to tell if
they need it or if they just want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking, speaking on like the medical
model in Oregon in general, I've heard
[SPEAKER_01]: whispers from people that the general
trend in Oregon is that there's a few
[SPEAKER_01]: companies opening up really big facilities
and their production is so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the major contributing
forces to that downward trend on pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel that is actually an accurate
analysis of the situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a statistic that came out mid
December of last year where we had about
[SPEAKER_02]: 1.2 or 1.1 million pounds in our metric
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the year before the entire state for
an entire, excuse me, entire year,
[SPEAKER_02]: consumed about 430 or 460,000 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, almost tripled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there is, there is an absolute glut
in our industry here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, once that product's entered
into metric, you don't have that old back
[SPEAKER_02]: door opportunity anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's locked up in the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are, you know, I think we're
going to see, a lot of folks having hard
[SPEAKER_02]: times weathering this storm in our state,
recreational growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be, it's, and I think,
you know, I think who really survives here
[SPEAKER_02]: or has the best opportunity to survive are
these smaller producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, their, their necks aren't
extended out quite as far as some of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, financially as some of these,
you know, large, well-funded operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're not turning a profit,
and it's, you know, still dumping more
[SPEAKER_02]: money into something, it's, it's,
that's a hard hole to get out of with
[SPEAKER_02]: prices plummeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't think we've seen the
bottom here yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you think they'll bottom out at?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: 500 maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something I was interested in a little
kind of peripheral, but it's kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: same vein.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was in Oregon, I felt it was a
really interesting place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was almost like the twilight zone in a
lot of regards, because it's extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to Australia in regards to like
people's general attitudes, the mood,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's really laid back,
pretty welcoming, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest thing that stood out in my
mind though, was I felt people were far
[SPEAKER_01]: more environmentally and kind of ethically
aware of their actions and their
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, everyone wants to be as
organic as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that far more in Oregon than
in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dichotomy, which slapped me in the
face though, is it doesn't seem to be that
[SPEAKER_01]: same focus in regards to cannabis in
regards to organically grown versus
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetically grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think that exists?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of the cannabis I tried in
Oregon myself was not organic as far as I
[SPEAKER_01]: could tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's a great, that's actually a
great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being in the retail side of the
industry, I can actually speak in speaking
[SPEAKER_02]: volumes of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really depends where you are in
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can even be as simple as what part
of a county you're in, whether you're
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing salt, synthetic growers,
organic, bottle growers, organic no-till,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you go down to a place like
Eugene, which is just a little bit South
[SPEAKER_02]: here of Portland, a college town full of
loads of hippie and counterculture folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to see tons of
organically produced cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get back up here to Portland and the
city kind of divides between, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Portland and then the West side,
which is Beaverton and Hillsborough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see a lot more salt growers out in
that zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then as you go closer, you go further
East towards Mount Hood from Portland,
[SPEAKER_02]: you start to get into rural farm country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's certainly a lot of organic
producers there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you know, the other thing to keep in
mind here is a lot of these cultivators 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago, not even 10 years ago,
six years and five years ago were still
[SPEAKER_02]: running smaller operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not necessarily producing for,
you know, they were clandestine
[SPEAKER_02]: operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not necessarily producing for the
medical market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's all about production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're starting to see that kind of
turn now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of commercial groups that
are just about production.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we actually see, you know,
the store that I work for, we're very,
[SPEAKER_02]: as far as what we focus on and what we
kind of preach, we certainly preach and
[SPEAKER_02]: focus more on organic and sustainable
approaches to cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it mean that we won't sell Kana or
Advanced or Botanica?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we certainly do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we try to push for the organic thing
through our store.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are other stores that rarely push
organics and you'll find, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot more synthetic products on their on
their shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, as you skip around from
store to store in the city, you can see
[SPEAKER_02]: really what that main customer base is
based on the nutrients that are more than
[SPEAKER_02]: readily available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can agree with that last point,
you know, 100 percent, because we're kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of experiencing that ourselves in that
previously there's only been synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: options.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the past few years, we've seen
the rise in organic options becoming more
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is a direct reflection of
the market demand as far as I can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And believe it or not, we end up having to
educate a lot of growers, both small home
[SPEAKER_02]: growers and commercial growers in how to
turn that operation into an organic
[SPEAKER_02]: operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so many a lot of your
synthetic growers have kind of had it
[SPEAKER_02]: drilled into their head that this is the
way to yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how you yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the organics doesn't yield enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that couldn't be any further from the
truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are certainly organic approaches
that not only, you know, deliver
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly flavorful cannabis,
but also can produce phenomenal yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the yields are so much
more, you know, strain contingent than
[SPEAKER_02]: anything else, if you ask me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think this, you know,
I think there's this kind of block
[SPEAKER_02]: blockade in the salt growers mind that I
can't go organic because I'm going to lose
[SPEAKER_02]: out on the yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: But and even cost wise, you can get very
competitive costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cost wise with organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand what you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing I've noticed,
maybe this is just, you know, a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of personal bias because I'm organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that the learning curve with
organics is a little steeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we got to that point where
people say the yield isn't as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, no, if you get up there
high enough on the curve, you'll get the
[SPEAKER_01]: same yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't agree with that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is if you write about one thing,
the curve is a little steeper and it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: little longer on fine tuning organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, you know, one of the best
pieces of advice that I give out at the
[SPEAKER_02]: shop is to, you know, pick a pick a
program, an organic program and so
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, you know, and really figure out
how to how that program can bring your
[SPEAKER_02]: strains to their full genetic expression.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't switch programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't switch up genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Work with those genetics with that
nutrient program where that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: or, you know, no-till approach or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But learn, you know, see what inputs are
really influencing that your group of
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics or your strain or whatever so
that you can get that best expression
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I truly believe that it's certainly
achievable through organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's achievable in synthetics too,
to some degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the people that are pushing
tons of phos salts into their product and
[SPEAKER_02]: bloom boosting with their, you know,
35-40, you know, zero 35-40 product at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end, you know, they're going to end up
with a bunch of road flare product for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not going to be very flavorful,
but it's going to yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to hate on our salt growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a few out there and some of them
do a really good job still.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on a lighter note, I constantly hear
this analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know if you agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit of tongue in cheek,
but people say to me, Colorado weeds too
[SPEAKER_01]: dry, Oregon weeds too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you agree?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Colorado weeds too wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado is too dry and we're too wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, you know, that I always
make the comment that whenever I,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause I do go to Denver, you know,
generally once or twice a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as I walk off the airplane,
I can feel the moisture leaving my lips
[SPEAKER_02]: because it is that dry there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is, you see that in Colorado with,
you know, I take cannabis there and within
[SPEAKER_02]: two days, if it's not, you know,
in a sealed container with a humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: pack, it's, you know, turned to rock hard
and eventually dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, yeah, it's, it's damp up
here in Oregon, but you know, it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I, a great example for Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a friend of mine who used to run,
you know, and he probably still does runs
[SPEAKER_02]: humidifiers in his drying room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's, that's a Testament to
how fricking dry it is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, here it's really about how
you, how you dry your cannabis and how you
[SPEAKER_02]: cure it after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I, I could, I could
understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone's gripe with Oregon being a
little too damp and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado is certainly dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get back to our industry talk in case
we didn't make it a bit obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've obviously managed and run
hydroponic stores slash grow stores in
[SPEAKER_01]: general for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've seen the fads come and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What products do you think fall under that
general fad cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to me feels like we've had,
you know, the Sheila's Yeet trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost completely died off,
you know, not, not almost there's maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: few stragglers, but they'll die off soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there, there've been a load of
what I just call kind of flash in the pan
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, you'll have to forgive me
because I can't in good conscience,
[SPEAKER_02]: call out too many of them on the negative
just because I'm going to sell some of
[SPEAKER_02]: them and I'm probably hear back from
others, but you know, they're the hype
[SPEAKER_02]: products that companies, invest loads of
money on into the marketing of those
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are here to stay for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them have come and gone already.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, you know,
the, I kind of split the industry into two
[SPEAKER_02]: groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the products that are made to
market and then the products that are just
[SPEAKER_02]: made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we, what I often find is that
the, the height companies, if you will,
[SPEAKER_02]: products, you know, they all work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise they wouldn't be in business,
but you're going to pay out the wazoo for
[SPEAKER_02]: them because gosh, they have to back all
that marketing somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two, it's, you know, it's generally
pretty cannabis, but not the best tasting
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, you know, things like what's a
good program.
[SPEAKER_02]: To that falls into this kind of flash in
the pan category.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I look and that, that book,
you know, so funny when that book came
[SPEAKER_02]: out, uh, how so many people clamored into
the store and wanted us to explain to them
[SPEAKER_02]: how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to buy the $500 book.
[SPEAKER_02]: They explain how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and of course that led to all
the stripping the leaves and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are like, oh, all you got to do
is strip leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, there's a whole like nutrient
feed that, they put in that book that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, compensates for the loss of your
storage houses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so, you know, it's, it's, you know,
I, I don't want to pick on anybody in
[SPEAKER_02]: particular, but there is a few of them out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and, and I keep stressing the heavily
marketed, heavily marketed thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, products that, that work and
produce well, don't need a lot of hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: They speak for themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: The results speak for themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I have sold product on
and off for the last 17 years and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, seen a lot of good ones come and
I've seen a few bad ones go, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, there was a point in time here in the
States, uh, few years back, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: going back to the kind of mid two
thousands to, you know, 2010 era,
[SPEAKER_02]: roughly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where, uh, there was Paco butyrozole
showing up in all these, uh, flower
[SPEAKER_02]: boosting products, phosphoload,
red dragon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was funny because the companies
that were creating these products were
[SPEAKER_02]: just simply, they create one, it would get
banned and then they would just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, rename, relabel the same product
and wait for that one to get banned.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Paco butyrozole is definitely
not a very pleasant compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, known carcinogen, especially if
you're, you're smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, there was a, you know,
a company down in California that had been
[SPEAKER_02]: called out by a couple of States for their
content of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and eventually, if I'm not mistaken,
the EPA got involved, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and banned the product nationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, some of these, you know,
and a few of these products were pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: heavily marketed and, you know,
this is the game changer, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: increase your yields, tenfold,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but all at what expense to the end?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, user.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so it was that, and you got to
remember too, there was very, very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very, very, very little regulation on our
industry until just a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: You described the Australian market right
now, the, you know, ramp it with plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growth, plant growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the issue, which I'm really
interested in knowing, and you probably
[SPEAKER_01]: have the answer is you just referenced one
situation where it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: How rampant do you think the problem is of
companies having off label PGRs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it really is a common
occurrence or it's more of a rare thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, in all honesty,
I believe that it's not as rampant as it
[SPEAKER_02]: used to be in this country.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go back five or six years,
it was pretty rampant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once States like California, uh,
and Oregon for their registration required
[SPEAKER_02]: a full disclosure of contents,
uh, that started, that ceased the free
[SPEAKER_02]: frequency of products like that ever
making it back into our market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, a few of these companies
were shut down and sued and made a lot of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, kind of a racket throughout the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, that got people to notice,
you know, before nobody really noticed,
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody really knew to ask, you know,
if this had a, uh, you know, a harmful PGR
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they just saw the results that it
created and thought like, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: if this product works, let's keep using
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and that's unfortunately, you know,
a, the, the, the result of having,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, back then, which was really an
uneducated customer base, which allowed a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of bad actors to thrive in our
industry here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once there was, you know, state
intervention on the level, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: by the department of agriculture and
various States, then the situation started
[SPEAKER_02]: to correct itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like we're at a point now
where, where it is at least in our state
[SPEAKER_02]: and certainly in California, very,
very difficult to register a product,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, that has in for our industry that has
a PGR.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got to remember, uh, the States,
we don't have a unified registration for
[SPEAKER_02]: the entire country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each state has its own registration for,
uh, nutrients, pesticides, fungicides,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason why I bring up that question
is because on your Instagram page,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's like a post kind of referencing
that there was some, uh, I believe the
[SPEAKER_01]: product is called Azotrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, it had some adulterants in
it, but they weren't actually plant growth
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were more like, um, in, uh,
what's the word?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say insecticides,
but yeah, pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think this is something which is a
little more rampant given?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to ask you, this is a
question as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do you think the next trend
will be in terms of these fad products we
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like pesticides, fungicides,
these are the ones on the rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it seems like every day there's
a new one, especially organic ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so we have, uh, we have a,
a registration here through the EPA,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, which is 25B compliant, which is low
or minimum risk pesticides, which those
[SPEAKER_02]: generally do not have to be thoroughly
tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to register as such,
as long as the ingredients that you
[SPEAKER_02]: provide are all 25B compliant,
then the EPA approves your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a lot of these 25B compliant
products, quote unquote, that seem to be
[SPEAKER_02]: sneaking things into their products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, when it comes, when,
when rubber meets the road with this and
[SPEAKER_02]: the company has their back against the
wall, you know, they blame their partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: They blame, you know, some nefarious force
that slipped this into their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, uh,
they're adding adulterants for some reason
[SPEAKER_02]: or the, or there's some kind of crap cross
contamination happening at the facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: The AZ-121 is very interesting and
intriguing to me because when,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I looked into the compounds that were
showing up in those tests, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: as adulterants, the addition of those
particular compounds made zero zilch,
[SPEAKER_02]: no sense whatsoever from a IPM or a
knockdown approach strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even, even if you're a big ag
person, the, that particular group just
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would all be in there together?
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of me wants to think that perhaps
there's some kind of residual
[SPEAKER_02]: contamination that's happening at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the company that manufactures that
product, manufactures every single one of
[SPEAKER_02]: those compounds in some shape or form,
uh, through their company and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, it doesn't make sense for a company of
that magnitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you gotta remember that's not a
hydro industry company.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an ag company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so it doesn't make any sense for them
to intentionally adulter their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the fact that it hasn't come back to
market yet, that's very curious to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but something that one was very
strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: There've been a couple others and believe
it or not, our store has kind of been
[SPEAKER_02]: ground zero for the discovery of these
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: What really brought the adulterant of
pesticides to light for our industry was
[SPEAKER_02]: the testing of finished product of the
cannabis and, and, and concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the, one of the first major cases
we had here was with a product called
[SPEAKER_02]: guardian.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guardian was being produced,
I think out of a company out of Michigan,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, lemongrass oil, uh,
cinnamon, a couple other little essential
[SPEAKER_02]: oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was being sold, believe it or not,
to organic growers as a way to knock back
[SPEAKER_02]: russet mites, which had just kind of found
their way into the Oregon scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone was just having this
incredible success with these essential
[SPEAKER_02]: oils, you know, and none of us get like,
wow, they've just kind of unlocked the key
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause no one could at that point in time
was having very much success getting rid
[SPEAKER_02]: of russet mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually, uh, I think it was two or
three cultivators, uh, down in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in that area, uh, failed their
pesticide screening, uh, for, because it
[SPEAKER_02]: has, uh, Aba mectin was present and,
uh, a lot of folks will know the brand
[SPEAKER_02]: name avid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if some people say it was
Ivermectin, some people says Aba mectin,
[SPEAKER_02]: but whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what the department of ag, so the,
the, the lab that found these test
[SPEAKER_02]: results, uh, called, you know,
called all the growers and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, everybody write down your list
of all your inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the three gardens all had one common
denominator, which was this guardian
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that lab, OG analytical down in Eugene
called the department of ag and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, we have a suspicion here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the department of ag contacted our
store cause we'd sold one of the bottles
[SPEAKER_02]: and said, Hey, do you have this product?
[SPEAKER_02]: We said, yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, we're going to come by and
grab a bottle off your shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they bought a bottle off of our shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went down to Eugene, which about two
hours away south, bought a bottle off
[SPEAKER_02]: their shelf and then went down to Southern
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bought a bottle of those, tested all three
of those independently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Voila, there's Avamectin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you call the, uh,
you know, so then the department of ag
[SPEAKER_02]: calls the company, the manufacturer and
the guy says, Oh, my partner just put some
[SPEAKER_02]: of that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, your partner didn't just slip some of
that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been there all along.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's actually killing russet
mites because I'm sorry, lemongrass and
[SPEAKER_02]: cinnamon oil isn't going to kill a russet
mite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it will, they, they're, they're great,
uh, repellents, but not necessarily kill
[SPEAKER_02]: factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that was the first case where
pesticide screening actually benefited the
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was that event that got me very,
very interested in, you know, looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: adulterants that were currently in,
in products in our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right after the
[SPEAKER_02]: Guardian, uh, situation, there was another
one with a product called mighty wash that
[SPEAKER_02]: was wildly and rampantly available as a 25
B.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one had frequency water in it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Quote unquote.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was killing mites, everyone just
destroying mites, spider mites,
[SPEAKER_02]: two spotted, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's, it's, it's,
you know, the, the, the, what was the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the gag was a vortex implosion.
[SPEAKER_02]: The frequency would stun the mite and the
oil would suffocate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was its mode of action.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so one of our customers comes back
to us and says, Hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've failed a couple tests now for
pyrethrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, what are you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: Go down the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, mighty wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I call up the department of ag and
said, Hey, at this point we have a nice
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, Hey, we've got this product here
and our customer keeps failing for
[SPEAKER_02]: pyrethrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to come check this out?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, we'll be right up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they came and bought a bottle off of
our shelf, did the same thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: bottle down in Southern Oregon,
bottle in Salem, Oregon, state capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, not Springfield is, uh,
but then, uh, they discovered pyrethrum in
[SPEAKER_02]: a product that was 25 B compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, and pyrethrum isn't the nastiest of
compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really of all of the knock down,
take down pesticides, it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's fairly safe to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you don't disclose it in your
product and people are using your product
[SPEAKER_02]: up to the day of harvest and then making
concentrates from your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how things scale up very quickly here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, this of course then goes
back to the mycobutanol thing and Eagle 20
[SPEAKER_02]: and the cyanide hydrogen or hydrogen
cyanide that's released from that when
[SPEAKER_02]: it's combusted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and that actually got me very heavily
involved with a couple of groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and there's a one, at least one white
paper out there that's published that I
[SPEAKER_02]: was a part of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I actually went to speak at a
cannabis conference in New York city,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, that, uh, a group called BoTech
analytical put on it was an international
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis conference and spoke on a panel
with a couple of other individuals
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically about adulterants and
entering into the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: For products used to cultivate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, it was, it,
it was very important to me for at that
[SPEAKER_02]: point to, you know, cause a lot of these
folks who came to this conference were
[SPEAKER_02]: very policy oriented or financial oriented
individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, uh, you know, it was something I
had to explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to understand that the majority
of the customers who are using these
[SPEAKER_02]: products that are going to the grow store
are not necessarily, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they certainly don't have pesticide
applicators licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're, they're not educated in the
world of pesticides, pesticide
[SPEAKER_02]: application.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so, you know, the, the old,
you know, just use twice as much as what
[SPEAKER_02]: the label recommends was a pretty popular
way of approaching pesticide and fungicide
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so for me, whenever a bulletin,
uh, and I'm always linked in with ODA
[SPEAKER_02]: alerts, uh, Oregon department of
agriculture, alerts, whenever a bulletin
[SPEAKER_02]: gets posted, I'm going to very quickly put
it up on the Instagram there because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the folks who do follow me in
this state, that's important for them to
[SPEAKER_02]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just kind of touching back on like,
I guess maybe a general undertone that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been going on in the whole conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you view a lot of these new organic
based pesticides with an eye of caution,
[SPEAKER_01]: or do you think that there is a legitimate
kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Area of research that could be done to
develop better organic pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I bring this up is
because, you know, there's obviously just
[SPEAKER_01]: such a vast contrast in the effectiveness
of synthetic versus organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like synthetic, it's like one application
and stuff just dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, with organic, it seems like,
you know, we're really trying to just
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, chase our tails,
but you can kind of get on top of it
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's the general situation
and it's not going to change too much?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, by looking at what the you
know, California is allowing, I'd say
[SPEAKER_02]: that's definitely the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what you're dealing with once
again is an uneducated customer base.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so until things like pesticide,
you know, and if you look at, so the way
[SPEAKER_02]: they are, the environmental protection
agency works here in the States is if you
[SPEAKER_02]: have a product that you're bringing to
market, you know, the EPA tests that goes
[SPEAKER_02]: through a rigorous testing, 120 some
different tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but they tested on specific crops and
on most labels of most pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it lists the specific crops that it is
legal to use that pesticide, fungicide,
[SPEAKER_02]: or miticide on.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you use it on some other crop,
let's say cannabis, then you're absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: violating EPA regulation and you can be
fined and all kinds of horrible things can
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, the big fear of the States and
allowing any pesticide or fungicide is
[SPEAKER_02]: that they would be defying EPA regulation
by allowing cultivators to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you find in most States,
as far as what is allowed are a lot of 25
[SPEAKER_02]: B compliant products that are safe or,
you know, that are, that are generally
[SPEAKER_02]: safety, you know, generally regarded as
safe when they call that gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so these products are somewhat benign
in the sense that they are, they are good
[SPEAKER_02]: control measures.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are very difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not as, they're not, they're not
as easy to create solution from it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they were getting better.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of companies out there,
uh, Morrone bio innovations that are
[SPEAKER_02]: putting forth some pretty interesting
products, uh, that, you know, I certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: get behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it's not about pesticides to
control past.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, good practices,
beneficial, predatory insects that can
[SPEAKER_02]: play well with bio pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, to me, that's the best approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, prevention is obviously the
first step.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you are dealing with, you know,
certain pests or certain funguses,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, there is generally a very good and
sound quote unquote organic approach to
[SPEAKER_02]: solving that problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it generally requires multiple steps
because they're like, even with chemicals,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no magic bullet in any of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it repeat applications and of certain
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, uh, for me, when it comes
to, you know, insects, uh, I love the idea
[SPEAKER_02]: of using predators coupled with bio
pesticides, uh, generally between those
[SPEAKER_02]: two arms, uh, you can solve many,
many, many problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a pretty far reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something I noticed on your Instagram
was that you, uh, do the gas lantern
[SPEAKER_01]: method.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit unusual thing,
something everyone's curious about,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I find, you know, certainly myself
never tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What initially stimulated you to do it and
what about it causes you to keep doing it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, oh gosh, how many years ago was this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably 2012 or 13, I was at a trade show
in Denver and a very good friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, came up behind me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whispered gas lantern, check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then walked away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, okay, so I was back in my
hotel room that night after the event and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, started looking online,
Google gas lantern, gas lantern comes
[SPEAKER_02]: across, you know, Joe's, Pietri's thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking at this whole lighting
schedule first and like, wow, this is like
[SPEAKER_02]: mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see how this could ever work out,
but then I'm reading the, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: he had put together kind of a reasoning of
why this works so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, his whole theory is that
we, we are constantly oversaturating
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis more so than it typically needs,
uh, to be able to be lit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he starts with, you know, people who
like to do 24 hours of veg, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, well, look at where it's 24
hours of light for extended periods of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's generally the polar regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look around the polar regions,
granted it's cold, but not much grows
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you can even come down a little bit
further and then you get into tundra
[SPEAKER_02]: regions, but you know, you're getting
lichen and grasses, but nothing that's
[SPEAKER_02]: lush and supple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, it's probably more temperature
related, but he's using this to drive a
[SPEAKER_02]: point home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then out of that, he's, he states
that, um, if you look at plants that are
[SPEAKER_02]: veg, you know, six, eight, 10 weeks to get
these large plants indoors under
[SPEAKER_02]: artificial lighting, we generally see
pre-flowering occurring somewhere in that
[SPEAKER_02]: fifth to sixth week of running like 18
six.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a photoperiod obligate plant,
this is, this is his theory now,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, which I somewhat subscribe to for a
photoperiod obligate plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a very unnatural reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So floral hormone should stay bottled up
in that plant until there, until that
[SPEAKER_02]: photoperiod triggers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that should release, release the
hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he says, so why are we seeing these
little, you know, pistols showing up five,
[SPEAKER_02]: six weeks into a veg?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it has a lot to do with this over
lighting of plants and it's more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: stress response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so the plants are letting out little
bits of floral hormones, uh, during a time
[SPEAKER_02]: when it should be keeping those bottled
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of the reasoning why he
says so I read this and I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, well this kind of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get back to Portland and pretty soon
thereafter decide, okay, I'm going to try
[SPEAKER_02]: and start with the veg, uh, 13 on what's
it five and a half off one on five and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half off or 12 on, excuse me, 12,
12 on five and a half off one on 12,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, five and a half off again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, so the light, the light break
is what kind of keeps these four hormones
[SPEAKER_02]: bottled up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way he, the way he rationalizes
that is the reason, the reason why they
[SPEAKER_02]: call it the gas lantern is, you know,
more than latitudinal glass houses in the
[SPEAKER_02]: wintertime trying to keep, uh,
flowering crops from flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go through in the middle of the
night, light up these gas lanterns and
[SPEAKER_02]: that little bit of a light break in the
middle of the dark cycle would keep those
[SPEAKER_02]: hormones bottled up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the flowers wouldn't express or shift
gears, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I applied that practice to my own
garden pretty quickly and was kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: amazed when I saw that, you know,
eight weeks into veg, there's no pestle
[SPEAKER_02]: showing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as soon as I'd put a plant into
flower, you know, and the theory here is
[SPEAKER_02]: you get this kind of rush of floral
hormones because they've been bottled up
[SPEAKER_02]: so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, when you put a plant in the flower,
you get a brush of floral hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so flower set does tend to occur a
couple of days early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I did the veg side of it for about
five rounds almost for an entire year
[SPEAKER_02]: before I ever subscribed to the flowering
and the diminishing light on the flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, you know, I, I just,
I, I, in the beginning, the first couple
[SPEAKER_02]: runs, like I just knew something bad was
going to come out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fortunately nothing ever did,
but it was, it's such a leap of faith
[SPEAKER_02]: when, you know, your entire growing
career, you're told 18, six, 18,
[SPEAKER_02]: six, 18, six, this is how you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people say like, Oh, you got to have
24 hours of light over your clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you know, when I people suggested 24
hours of light over clones to keep the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature stable, that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I clone under gas lantern,
great, great success from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so on the veg side of things,
it's, it's a great money saving
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity, especially for a large
commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I've heard lots of people
think, Oh, you know, it decreases your
[SPEAKER_02]: yield or it slows down the veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I couldn't, that certainly has not
been my experience whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly haven't had any yield loss over
the years and the veg keeps up just as,
[SPEAKER_02]: as good as ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so it, it, but it is, it's,
it's, it's a huge leap of faith.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and I can't stress that it's,
it's such a hard shift to make in your
[SPEAKER_02]: head to say, okay, I'm only going to light
these veg plants up 13 hours a day now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess maybe we try to condense all of
that down into one line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you advocate everyone uses the gas
lantern method?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because there are some strains that
will act adversely to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, equatorial strains, especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that, and I've only had,
I've had one strain in my life,
[SPEAKER_02]: not work with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was Cinex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cinex did not react very good to the veg
program at all, but Cinex can be kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: wild plant to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it, yeah, I mean, I think for
someone who's coming out of the gates,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe a hobbyist, if you want to have
that, you know, guaranteed your genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: going to work fine with it, then run your
18 six.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think for someone with a little more
experience, that's willing to experiment
[SPEAKER_02]: with their genetics to see how they react.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like I said, all of mine, except for
that one strain, which I don't run
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore, uh, all of mine have done fine by
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think someone with some
experience that's willing to take a risk,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's better for them than perhaps someone
who's completely green to the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to completely clarify,
because I only very briefly referenced it
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you believe in defoliation at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we kind of were, you know,
talking shit about three or life,
[SPEAKER_01]: but do you believe there's any merit in
defoliation of any kind?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you just kind of nodded into it at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, I do periodic, I don't strip
my plants personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and keep in mind too,
you know, I'm, I'm a smaller cultivator,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I don't have a giant warehouse or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, so I have the ability to
work very closely with the number of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that I do have on a very personal
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I will remove fan leaves as
I see fit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're shadowing out of, you know,
a lower branch, or I want to get a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit more light down that, you know,
down that, that one branch, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I will do periodic removal throughout the
bloom process, but I am not a family
[SPEAKER_02]: stripper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it can work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of my varieties reacted fairly
decently to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of them didn't react so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I bagged it after two attempts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but keep in mind too, that it's more
than just, you know, the stripping of the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also this augmenting of the feed
to provide, you know, kind of consistent
[SPEAKER_02]: flow of nutrients because you are removing
those storage houses when you strip them
[SPEAKER_02]: all away from the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take a step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realize we didn't go over it and I
really want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Albert Walker itself, it's an
interesting strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit of an enigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one can tell me too much about it and
no one ever has any to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Albert Walker that we had in the
mid 2000s was a very finicky plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: but had this incredible kind of
combination of like a rose note,
[SPEAKER_02]: like from roses, you know, a very floral
sweet rose.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with this crazy kind of garlic funk as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like, yeah, it was a very,
very strange and, and, and, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, interesting plant to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a bit finicky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't run it for very long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it, it just, yeah, it just had
such this clash of noses on it that it was
[SPEAKER_02]: just, it was just remarkable.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high was decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it wasn't, uh, stupendous or anything
like that, but the, the, it was the flavor
[SPEAKER_02]: that really got me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's that unmistakable rose note
with that garlic kind of buried in there
[SPEAKER_02]: that just, it just gets me every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen it for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a lot of things come through.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually had a lot of folks cause
I've at one point was kind of in this head
[SPEAKER_02]: space of getting back to the root genetics
of dog walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a couple of years ago, I went on a
hunt for, uh, the Albert Walker and I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know three or four different
specimens have been brought to me and none
[SPEAKER_02]: of them, none of them were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of them were it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I, I don't, you know, I'm sure it
is still in existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I hear a lot of folks kind of on the
West, there's a crew on the West side of
[SPEAKER_02]: our area that runs Albert Walker pretty
heavy, but, um, I've yet to see what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're producing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's kind of, and it is,
it's a bit of an enigma strings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a lot of imposters out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, it's just like chem,
you know, there's so many imposters out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, finding, getting to the, to the,
you know, to the origins of the real,
[SPEAKER_02]: to that real cut can be a very daunting
task.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you give any credence to the
current online story, which says that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, originates from the Grateful
Dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is roadie crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doubtful on that, but you know,
like some kind of Grateful Dead Genesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you think that's true?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also says that the suspected
genetics, uh, Afghan skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, look, we have a lot of
incredible genetics came out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Grateful Dead scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, there's, uh, there's loads
of stories we can tell, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, I do buy into the, you know,
I buy into the Northwest origin of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy into the, that it was something that
evolved out of the Grateful Dead scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, whether it was the roadie crew or
someone else who really knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and you said Swazi skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, sorry, Afghan skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, an Afghan skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as interesting as Swazi skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was just gonna say Swazi skunk
sounds great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I could, I could see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was definitely a squatter
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what was really remarkable to me,
it was this very light colored,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, green, almost like a pale,
green.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was never really a super dark robust
plant for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that could have been part of its
finnickiness and us at that time,
[SPEAKER_02]: not being able to really dial it in
nutrient wise, but it, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it, yeah, I think it gets its origin from
the Grateful Dead scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't doubt that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting because it's certainly
gone on to make, you know, a wide variety
[SPEAKER_01]: of well-known strains, but if we just take
a bit of a step forward to after you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: made the dog walker OG, let's get into the
Scoobies.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point did it become, you know,
a thought in your mind to cross dog walker
[SPEAKER_01]: with the cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that came out of my cookie experience
and it was very interesting with cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I was running the forum cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to sound really hard to
believe, but if I only ran one plant in
[SPEAKER_02]: the room, one cookie plant, it would
always produce a tiny, tiny male cluster
[SPEAKER_02]: on one of the bottom branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one though.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time it happened, I thought it
was a phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second time it happened, it made me
pay attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third time it happened,
I did it intentionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was the pollen from that forum
cut that I used on that second event to
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinate the dog walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I thought to myself, well,
here's this, how cool would it be to have
[SPEAKER_02]: all these purples and stuff wrapped up in
dog walker?
[SPEAKER_02]: And um, I, it was, it was a risk for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want the, to create like another
cookie plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I didn't want to be like grow,
you know, grow like that cookie structure
[SPEAKER_02]: just drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the time I actually pollinated with
that, that little bit of mail with that
[SPEAKER_02]: little cluster that had developed dusted a
dog walker plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also at the time I was running a
cotton candy kush and dusted a cotton
[SPEAKER_02]: candy kush plant as well with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, just using, you know,
collected pollen in a small container,
[SPEAKER_02]: little paint brush, you know, short
bristles, just painting it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we ended up, oh gosh, what did I have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably close to a hundred, 150 of the
scooby seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many of those still exist?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably about 60 at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of them went out for a big
Fino hunt this summer out at heroes of the
[SPEAKER_02]: farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, a lot of those were
lost to a mouse issue when they were still
[SPEAKER_02]: young and tender.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like a couple flats, I think got
chewed up at some point, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: there were some others that were explored
this summer, uh, which I've yet to,
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw them right as they were finishing
when they were still in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, you know, the, the original is a
hard one to beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And originally I had two different Finos,
the one that I kept and the other one
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't very stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I called it the scrappy do a little
tongue in cheek there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that got actually passed on to some
folks and they did whatever they did with
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it still kind of pops up around town
here and, you know, off and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the, the scooby that was selected and
there's really kind of a heartwarming
[SPEAKER_02]: story from that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that original, the one that
I liked, so the reason I liked is that the
[SPEAKER_02]: flower was more, uh, structure wise was a
little more dog walker dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it had all the, it had some of the
cookie coloring in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just had this just extremely
offensive nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I passed it off to a coworker of mine
for safekeeping cause I was running out of
[SPEAKER_02]: room and I just, I couldn't, I was
exploring the other stuff at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, you know, Hey, can you hold
this for me?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, the coworker, uh, passed away at
an untimely time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when that happened, a small group of
us went over to his house before his
[SPEAKER_02]: family arrived to clean up the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that wouldn't be something they would
have to deal with because maybe they
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't know he had a garden or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we get over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I walk into the room and I see the
scooby plant can't plant over in the
[SPEAKER_02]: corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of looked around, there was a
couple other people there and I grabbed a
[SPEAKER_02]: pair of scissors and I cut, I don't know,
maybe a dozen cuttings and wrapped them up
[SPEAKER_02]: with a wet paper towel and threw them in a
Ziploc.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just, just massacred what was
left of that plant because I didn't want
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody else to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took those clones back to my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, called my friend Pat,
who's a guy who started Piers of the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, Hey, you know, I have these
cuts that I got from my buddy's house and
[SPEAKER_02]: I need them to go somewhere safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pat says, Oh yeah, you know,
I'll come by and get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pat actually took them back to his
house and kind of forgot about them,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for almost a week, maybe 10 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he finally remembered they were
in the back of his fridge, he's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit, those cuts were in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he actually got, I think two of them
to root.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, out of great tragedy came
something phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, it's, uh, and those
guys out at heroes were very good to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interestingly enough, I actually just got
it back for the first time about three,
[SPEAKER_02]: three and a half months again now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't run it in all, in all these
years since that very first run and then
[SPEAKER_02]: passing it onto the coworker and
eventually passing it on to heroes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a, what a kind of journey it's taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it has.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, she wears her badge as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take a step back for a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to play devil's advocate,
throw you in the hot seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think Archive knew what he was doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, I, I have a lot of respect
for those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're phenomenal breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're phenomenal growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a lot of good work.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, you know, he's a Fletcher's,
a fellow Virginian.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got mad respect for that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another one for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, it's very interesting to me because
so we had it working pretty heavily
[SPEAKER_02]: through the dispensary system here in
Portland and Eugene, Oregon in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I was doing, I would always
do searches to make sure it wasn't showing
[SPEAKER_02]: up, you know, in other people's gardens
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that was another one that we were
trying to keep super kind of contained.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll never forget the day that I
looked up and Leafly had Scooby snacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I go and onto the Leafly page and
I'm like, Oh, this isn't right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course a lot of the comments that
were shortly thereafter to follow were
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Oh, we thought this was this and not
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, to me at that point,
at that point of time, the, my biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: concern was, you know, if someone went,
you know, had tried one version and then
[SPEAKER_02]: went and bought seeds of another version
and didn't get anything that was close,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how is that person going to feel
as a customer?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I was a little concerned
at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, there was a point in time
where I was probably a little more hyped
[SPEAKER_02]: up about it than I am now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at this point it's water under the
bridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I finally actually got to see
some of the archive Scooby snacks last
[SPEAKER_02]: year and it's a good strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course they have, I know they have some
other ones that that one pales in
[SPEAKER_02]: comparison when you compare them to some
of those really, really high end stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the purist in me wants to think
that, or the purist, the lover in me wants
[SPEAKER_02]: to think that it was just happenstance.
[SPEAKER_02]: The industry side of me says, you know,
perhaps there was, you know, a little
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage taken up there, but I don't
know, you know, we've never had the
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've met briefly a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I have a lot of respect for
what the guy, what those guys do there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, what really kind of settled
me on it was when I went to the Emerald
[SPEAKER_02]: cup two years ago in 2016.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point I was a little more
concerned and you know, everyone that I
[SPEAKER_02]: met, that there knew the one eye version.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that kind of made me feel
good, you know, and it calmed me down a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, they, so the people to me
that, you know, that eventually would
[SPEAKER_02]: matter, they knew which one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's, so it's hard to,
it's, it's, it's hard to, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, I don't want to,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, I want to, I kind of want to play
Switzerland on this one because like I
[SPEAKER_02]: said, there's a part of me that believes
one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other side that believes something
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this point I'm going with the,
the, the do right person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I see the situation, I just think
if you do boil it down, the genetics do
[SPEAKER_01]: seem really similar, although dog walk is
not the same as the face off, still kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like OG to cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still kind of similar thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the big thing that I noted is Oregon
above other places in my opinion has very
[SPEAKER_01]: much kind of like, you know, there's,
there's cult followings, the J1,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Blue Magoo and Scooby Snacks,
you know, so I would find it hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that he wasn't aware of the strain
given that it is a cult followed one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon has that culture of locking onto a
few strains and really loving them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just tend to think that it would
be very hard for him to have not been
[SPEAKER_01]: aware.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and, and if you, and I'll just say
one little thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the names when you look at the
lineage is serendipitous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, very loosely touches on
the idea of ownership.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does ownership of a plant mean to
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you get ownership of a plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you have to stop listening to
other people in regards to what you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my experience with dog walker
taught me a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a point of time for the first
couple of years where I was obsessed with,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, contacting people who claimed
they were, you know, they had,
[SPEAKER_02]: they had clones of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, cause at that point it was
trying to figure out how did this leak
[SPEAKER_02]: out?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it get outside our small group of
eight?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, over time you eventually
find out the cracks in the wall occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, it's the ownership thing to
me, it's, it's a tough subject because as
[SPEAKER_02]: a breeder, you know, I don't necessarily
want to forever profit off my work,
[SPEAKER_02]: but at least want to, you know,
just be known for what I've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, you know, if you've created
something and you're using, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, if I'm going to be breeding
with something, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily release it, you know,
at that time because I want to work with
[SPEAKER_02]: it and kind of hold it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, look, some of these amazing
genetics that are out there get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, start off in this amazing realm
and then just kind of get played out for
[SPEAKER_02]: once.
[SPEAKER_02]: For one reason or another, and I don't
know because it's overpopulated,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the cannabis scene or what.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of them, you know,
are still major players and the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: never gets tired of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, on the ownership tip,
it's, you know, it depends on,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, what the, you know, and I'm very,
you know, intellectual property is
[SPEAKER_02]: something to me that's very important
moving forward in this industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially for those who are creating
these genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there, you know, I wish there
was some way for someone to protect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's, if you think about
something, you know, think about all the
[SPEAKER_02]: folks who have profited off of,
you know, chem dog and chem dog crosses,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, you know, the guy who originally,
you know, cracks the seeds doesn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: jack squat from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's folks out there who've made
millions off of those crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if there was a, an easy
foreseeable way for folks to stake
[SPEAKER_02]: ownership, and now that it's become more
commercialized, I think that's more
[SPEAKER_02]: important than it was maybe in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I don't want is for, you know,
all these breeders to have done these
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing, you know, projects with genetics
and then all to have it swooped up in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future by some corporate giant that's
figured out a way to get a utility patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what if we simplify that a little
bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I understand it's a, it's a little
bit of a complex issue in the way I
[SPEAKER_01]: outlined it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we make it a bit more simpler and
it's, we're talking about seeds you've
[SPEAKER_01]: purchased.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not just like, you know, in the case of
the dog walk, you know, it was a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: complex issue because it was given out
under these specific conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what if you just bought seeds from
someone you don't know?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, is that as far as you're
concerned, he's free for all, whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do at that point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I actually, so when I grab seeds
from different seed, from different
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders, you know, at events like the arm
roll cup, I'm, I'm, I'm upfront about an
[SPEAKER_02]: asking, say, Hey, do you mind if I breed
with this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, to me, that is a very important
question for me to ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: And although I've rarely had anyone ask me
about that, about any of my genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, some have come forward and asked,
and I think that's kind of doing the do
[SPEAKER_02]: right rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I, I, you know, I think it is
something that if there is a virtual like
[SPEAKER_02]: online relationship, an existing personal
relationship with the purveyor of the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed, I, you know, I think if you're
trying to do right in this industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a conversation that you should have
as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you mind if I work with your
work with your genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to create something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to redo what you've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, so I, I think it's, it's in,
to me, it's important to have that
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation with a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, cause you know, sometimes people do
get a little chat about people breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: with their gear and stuff like that,
not, you know, in kind of staking
[SPEAKER_02]: ownership and not giving credit to the
breeder of those root genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we follow that same thought,
you know, you reference what you got at
[SPEAKER_01]: the Emerald cup and things like that,
if we check your IG, we can see nice
[SPEAKER_01]: little stash from the most recent Emerald
cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you plan to pop first?
[SPEAKER_02]: So first is definitely the Burmese land
race from coastal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be doing a male hunt with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was actually just recently
gifted some Magna Rosa, which is a
[SPEAKER_02]: Brazilian from Brazilian seed company,
Magna Rosa land race, which I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: peel, you know, peel through some of those
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause right now I'm kind of on this,
I'm actually not kind of, I'm on a male
[SPEAKER_02]: hunt right now, which I have to do very,
very carefully in my small, smaller space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the other one that I would really
be, there was, uh, the roadkill Ganni,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, from Matt riot from riot seeds,
uh, was also one that I'm very interested
[SPEAKER_02]: in looking into that, that, that comes out
of the, uh, they call it the heirloom
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that comes out of the project
that maybe he and Bodhi did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking for roadkill skunk through all
these various Afghani seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the, I think it was like a nine year
project or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, they finally came up with one
that truly is, they feel it's the roadkill
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, getting into that it's going to be
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, what was the other one I was
going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, just because I have to,
if they get the granny skunk from
[SPEAKER_02]: dominion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have to, I can't resist that one
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've got, yeah, yeah,
no, no, no, there isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and, and then we've got a couple of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a little breeding this past summer
with a puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mail the puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is one of the, uh, Bob Hempel crosses out
at coastal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just stole my next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, we also see you've
been growing out the puck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: From our friend Bob at coastal.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you find this line?
[SPEAKER_01]: And more interestingly, in my opinion is,
you know, the park or the skelly hash
[SPEAKER_01]: plants quickly becoming one of the most
sought after cuts around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think it lives up to the hype
in terms of what it brought as a parent to
[SPEAKER_01]: the cross?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So funny thing about the puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know the puck from years in the past,
and it was definitely very popular with
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the folks who were dealing with
Kim back in the day, the Kim dogs and some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Virginia guys too, that I knew,
uh, very big up in new England.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I, at the Emerald cup in 2016,
uh, I walked up to the coastal booth and I
[SPEAKER_02]: saw that on their list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, it was the, one of the guys behind
the booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, Oh, what do you guys know about
the puck?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, well, let me get the guy who
bred it and come talk to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy comes up and he's like,
Oh, he's like, Hey, I hear you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about the puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah, you know,
I breed with some of the chem genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, this was real popular in the
chem family, yeti yeti.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, what chem genetics did you
bring?
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you breed?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, Oh, well, you know,
I bred dog walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy looks down at me and he says,
first words that come out of his mouth
[SPEAKER_02]: were DJ rich DJs are mutual friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I looked up in him and I said,
Bob Hemphill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you hadn't seen Bob in 15 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, back when I knew him,
dreads and beard, you know, he's a clean
[SPEAKER_02]: shave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had this kind of, of reintroduction
after a 15 year gap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was all over the puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as far as the, the puck,
you know, living up to its hype,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can certainly say that the chemivore
that I went with from the puck,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, definitely has that hash plant
structure, the way it grows, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you can get some really nice nugs off
of it, but it was heavily influenced from
[SPEAKER_02]: that NL one male.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one I have, has this kind of just
straight up, just about acetate nose to
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like rubber cement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, really, really intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now by the look of it, you know,
it's, it's that kind of old hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, it's not super frosty, you know,
it's not caked and glistening,
[SPEAKER_02]: but man, the nose on that thing is just
unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the male that I went with actually had
the same growth, very similar growth
[SPEAKER_02]: pattern to the female I selected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as much as you can get out of the
stem rub, just about spot on with each
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that male pollen was used this past
summer on some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some new things coming down the pike
from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the puck is an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bob Hemphill's puck, yeah, is definitely
out of this world.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least the one that I found in the
actual, the selection that I made when I
[SPEAKER_02]: brought it to him this past year at the
Emerald Cup, he was like, he's super
[SPEAKER_02]: stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, I got to come up and get that
cut, which I thought was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I actually got to try some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had almost like this watermelon vibe to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was another one that has a little
more watermelon side.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was two that I gave him and one has
a little bit, and that one actually was
[SPEAKER_02]: not super stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've, I've unfortunately I've scrapped
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one, like I said, it's just
almost, it's just very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and I guess, you know, taking a step
back, I guess you could get a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of watermelon out of the one we kept.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that being said, you know,
it's, it's an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say enough good things about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely become one of my new
favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I can't wait to explore some of
these new crosses that it's provided me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if you're purposely trying
to not spill the beans, but what crosses
[SPEAKER_01]: did you make?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did the pucca on the chem four,
the pucca on the biz, which is a dog
[SPEAKER_02]: walker sister.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did pucca on to dog walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did pucca on to the walk three,
which is the AWOG forum cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were the pucca dustings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we actually also worked with
another male from another cross from Bob
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemphill.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the Fairfax four-way crossed with
South Fork Seeds Sirius, which the Sirius
[SPEAKER_02]: is basically just a bunch of chems thrown
back and forth on each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a four-way Sirius stud that
just, just was beautiful in structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one was used to actually back
cross our F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that also went on to the chem
four as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so which one are you personally most
excited for?
[SPEAKER_02]: To be very blunt, the biz and the pucca.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, yeah, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the biz, the biz is dog walker's
sister and she definitely yields a little
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: She tests a little higher and there's an,
there's once it cures out, there's this
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing amount of limonene that comes out
of that flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gas is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The woodiness is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the gas and the woodiness seem to
kind of flip flop on the biz.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, on the dog walker, I feel like
you get this like a kind of a cedar
[SPEAKER_02]: sandalwood on the inhale with,
you know, loads of gas on the exhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one you get, you know,
this kind of gassy on the inhale with a
[SPEAKER_02]: cedar sandalwood finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's this limonene thing
happening in there that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: once again, it's one of those strains that
the layers from a flavor evolve,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, well after the exhale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, you know, something that
I'm always shooting for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking that, that, you know,
that, that female and then throwing in
[SPEAKER_02]: this very kind of accurate astringent note
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping the sky's the limit for that
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we just take a jump back to,
kind of some growing style questions,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is something I've been interested in
for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is kind of the hierarchy
or shall we just say the, the order,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the list of what needs to be
mastered in terms of a grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the fundamental thing you first
have to do as a grower is you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn to read the plan, not, not on like
the holistic level at like what a crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: good grower can do, but on the most simple
level, which is like, when does it need
[SPEAKER_01]: water?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the first thing you learn
to visually tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you, then you go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, put, put that at the back of
your mind for the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your list?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do you think is the kind of
the things you look to master?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the underlying kind of, you know,
how should I say, vein of this question is
[SPEAKER_01]: that people seem to want to skip the
basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you see all of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really believe that the foundation to
all of this begins with, with,
[SPEAKER_02]: with observation and you bring a very
valid point of, you know, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: something as simple as when it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it need water?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does a yellowing leaf mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, asking these questions and
answering them either through research or
[SPEAKER_02]: through a Q and a with someone who's a
little bit more knowledgeable,
[SPEAKER_02]: but really the, you know, everything can
kind of be cookie cuttered for most
[SPEAKER_02]: growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a feed schedule can be provided
a lighting schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look up in a book, you know,
back, back when I started these resources
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's so many more resources today
that people can utilize to get them into
[SPEAKER_02]: those good growing practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and it, and it does start with the
basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a small, you know, at least
rudimentary understanding of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what are the important nutrients,
you know, your NPK calcium, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, iron, sulfur, manganese name a
few, you know, and, you know, and an
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding at least for, you know,
nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium, magnesium, you know, what those
elements really do for the plant and why
[SPEAKER_02]: they're important at certain times and not
as important at others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so, you know, just having a
rudimentary understanding of how the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: uses nutrients to me is a really,
really good foundation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does take a little bit of brief
reading to discover, uh, it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to be super in depth to have that kind of
general understanding, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and after that, you know, and it really,
you know, so much of this is, and I tell
[SPEAKER_02]: people this all the time is it's just
experience based, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's facing these facing challenges and
learning how to overcome them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, when someone says that,
you know, they want to like, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: they asked me, you know, all the time,
how do you know all this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I get this question all the time at the
shop and I just, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's 25 plus years of trying to understand
it better and constantly wanting to learn
[SPEAKER_02]: and to better my practice as to improve,
you know, my results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's this constant need and desire to,
to do better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so, you know, for that, for the
general purpose of, you know, where does
[SPEAKER_02]: it all begin?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it all begins with having that just
basic understanding of plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so kind of little extension of that
idea is on, on top of trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: continually get better at reading the
plant, things like that, how important is
[SPEAKER_01]: it to you to constantly be popping new
genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you put value on or do
you think it's fine to just run the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing again and again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, and I'll go back to what I
was talking, kind of touched on this
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I tell a lot of my customers this
to work, you know, your genetics with your
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients to see how to best, you know,
do you get to that full genetic expression
[SPEAKER_02]: via the nutrients that you're using or
you're provided or the method or however
[SPEAKER_02]: you're, whatever your approach is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's, it's important if you
want to, if, you know, it depends what
[SPEAKER_02]: your goal is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to, you know, see what a new
strain does, you know, running at one
[SPEAKER_02]: time, isn't a very good, you know,
uh, litmus test for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I believe a lot of the
scientific method, you know, things need
[SPEAKER_02]: to be done at least three times to see,
you know, to make a, a, a conscious or try
[SPEAKER_02]: to value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for validation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it to me, you know, I encourage,
and of course this all goes back to like
[SPEAKER_02]: skill level too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, someone who's new, I'm not going
to recommend skip around genetics every
[SPEAKER_02]: round.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you'll never, you know, it'll be such
a slow, such a longer, prolonged learning
[SPEAKER_02]: curve with that approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, you know, working with a
specific strain or two, learning that
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic inside and out, if it's
interesting to you, that's how you learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, if it's not interesting,
you're going to bail on it anyway,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, uh, they see way too many folks who
change genetics every round or change
[SPEAKER_02]: their nutrient, you know, regimen every
round and not necessarily for the sake of
[SPEAKER_02]: bettering, but just to try something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a pretty haphazard way
of going about, you know, cultivating
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think is the biggest kind
of mistake you see from customers coming
[SPEAKER_01]: into the store?
[SPEAKER_02]: Overwatering most common mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many problems start and especially
overwatering of starter plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, or transplanted plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's the beginning of so many
issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and, uh, that's hands down the most
common one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, I, if the way I tried to
rationalize it with my customers,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially with a younger plant,
you know, the, a lot of folks tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: overwater a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, significantly, you know, they'll put a
small rooted clone into a larger,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, vessel of dirt, let's say a one
or two gallon pot and want to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, keep hammering water to keep
that pot saturated in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem with that is that,
you know, compacted muddies media is now
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of choking off the oxygen supply,
making it harder for those roots to excel
[SPEAKER_02]: and to grow out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course you slow down the root
process, you slow down the growth process,
[SPEAKER_02]: slow down the growth process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're, you know, you're causing all kinds
of ripple effects throughout the life of
[SPEAKER_02]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm a very, very big believer in
starting off with really good,
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you start off with a not so healthy
plant, then, you know, you can almost
[SPEAKER_02]: expect to face significant challenges
throughout the life cycle of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing we've heard anecdotally from
previous guests, Jeremy of Build A Soil
[SPEAKER_01]: was that he thinks there's certain plants
which are just pretty good regardless of
[SPEAKER_01]: your skill level, like as in like,
you know, they tend to come out pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: He noted GG4 is one that he finds to fall
in that category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find there's some that fall into
that category?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, like, I guess these would be
kind of like the more newbie friendly type
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your recommendations?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we, the bulletproof strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, there's a strain that's been
very popular here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as popular as it was back in the
early 2000s, but still around today called
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Green Queen was a strain that,
and back then, you know, whereas we're
[SPEAKER_02]: teaching, we actually teaching friends to
grow and stuff like this, you could hand
[SPEAKER_02]: Green Queen to anybody and they would see
marginal or decent success from the Green
[SPEAKER_02]: Queen even on their first round out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was pretty much, you know,
powdery mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could take an under or overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fairly decent yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say it was absolutely spider
mite resistant because that certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't the case, but it certainly wasn't
ground zero for infestations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it, you know, that particular plant
was, it was a newbie plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could give it to anybody and they
could see some success.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I do believe that there are some
of those bulletproof strains out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I personally haven't worked with
gorilla, excuse me, GG4.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I can't speak to the ease of
that one, but I do see a lot of our novice
[SPEAKER_02]: growers, you know, through the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't seem to be coming into me
with too many headaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and a lot of, a lot of those,
I feel like kind of Blue Dream is another
[SPEAKER_02]: one of those more current strains that's
kind of bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty easy for folks to,
you know, follow a simple nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: regimen, you know, keep your lights on
schedule, keep the humidity where it
[SPEAKER_02]: should be, temperatures where they should
be, and that plant's going to turn and
[SPEAKER_02]: burn from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of us people, but then there are
strains like, you know, like some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: OGs and even chem can kind of be this way,
but they get a little bit more finicky and
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely require a little bit more skill
to finesse that plant into its,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, prime potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the chem is one of those ones
for me where I think it's lucky that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't get thrown out in the sense that,
you know, if certain conditions aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: right, I just feel like it doesn't come
out anywhere near its full potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like not, not obviously having a lot of
experience growing the chem myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just through the variance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got a lot of really chem dominant
leading plants and you can see it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like for example, for me,
at least being in Australia, the heat
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely just destroys that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't perform well in the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to myself, what if that
happened with chem?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just ran it and was like,
this is just bunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just throw it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a different world this would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm glad that wasn't the, I'm glad
that wasn't the case with, with his
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, no, it's you bring up actually a
very valid point.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a, a group down in Cali that
ran, I think it was dog walker and Scooby
[SPEAKER_02]: in two locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was inland, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: On the East side of the Hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one was more in a coastal
region.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plants grown on the East side of
the Hills more inland.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that more kind of dry, drier climate
of NorCal didn't do that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones at the coastal location were some
of their highest yielding plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, you know, it can make a
significant difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, is that because,
you know, of where the dog walker and
[SPEAKER_02]: Scooby come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've just kind of naturally
acclimated to that cool or damper climate,
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, you know, the majority of
it's cultivated indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of have a hard time believing
that, but maybe there's something to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that happened, that test that was done
down there run was, it was hard to ignore
[SPEAKER_02]: the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just as a bit of a random oddball
question, what strain has been lost that
[SPEAKER_01]: either you had or that you knew of that
you'd love to get back if possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: My sugar cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost that one recently and that was a
good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the one that was the,
that one was the forum cut, the mill,
[SPEAKER_02]: the selfing pollen that I collected onto a
cotton candy kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made this, the structure was still
very much cookie in the flour,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the flavor was just, there was like
blueberry and like a haze spice in there
[SPEAKER_02]: that was just fricking off the charts good
to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And made phenomenal bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one, unfortunately was lost
recently to a, to a cloning mix up
[SPEAKER_02]: labeling issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other one, you know, it's
interesting because Bob brought it up
[SPEAKER_02]: because I remember this one too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brought up the rapture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one was always this kind of,
he never, I did not see it for very long
[SPEAKER_02]: and only saw it a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from what I remember of it,
just everything about that was just about
[SPEAKER_02]: picture perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that one I do remember and
that's essentially because I've,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some folks back East recently that
were like, ah, you know, if it's there,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll find it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put them to task on the rest,
but I have a feeling that one's probably
[SPEAKER_02]: been long gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure Bob Hemphill can speak more to
that than I can, but that one was
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely very special and it was very
short lived in my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's one I'd love to see again.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could think of any others,
you know, the real Trinity would be nice
[SPEAKER_02]: to see again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the Trinity blueberry that everyone
else has, but that old real Trinity that
[SPEAKER_02]: was, you know, almost velvety and it's,
you know, and it's tricone production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just kind of, that was another
one of those kind of silver gray green
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that, you know, once you,
once you've, once again, once you've had
[SPEAKER_02]: it, just, it's, it leaves a mark on your
palette and you never forget.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's so easy now to pick out
the imposters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should, you should hunt down not so
dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's got the real deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'll write that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried it at the cup and it sounds
exactly like what you're describing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool to hear, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to get him on soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting though, when you
mentioned that rapture thing, I'm actually
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get Hannah bolt to come on soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know this.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's smoked more rapture than anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like without trying to give away all the
details, essentially the guy who had it
[SPEAKER_01]: with the source, she was much closer to
him than what Bob was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she would kind of get first offerings
before Bob did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so she ended up getting access to a
lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you know, mine had to trickle down
from probably, you know, him to another
[SPEAKER_02]: friend to eventually to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my, you know, what I was exposed to,
like I said, was super limited,
[SPEAKER_02]: but definitely very memorable.
[SPEAKER_02]: How fun for her to have that advantage
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good for her.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to get the rundown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mythical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last couple of questions I've got are
actually kind of more legalization based
[SPEAKER_01]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you'd be a good source of this
in terms of Oregon, at least, do you view
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization as having had a net positive?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was, I was more, I've always
been more of a decriminalization than
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization regulation fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, with legalization plus
regulation, the inevitable will happen
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will provide opportunity for the few.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will eliminate the many factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I think it's, you know,
I've seen so many folks who are
[SPEAKER_02]: passionate, you know, for many years,
kind of turn away from the entire industry
[SPEAKER_02]: recently shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, stop something that they've been
doing for the last 15 or 20 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they just get kind of jaded by
the reality of commercialization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it's kind of a careful
what you wish for scenario for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is this, it doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't happen, of course, early on in
Oregon, same thing in Colorado is kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, even back in Montana when
things were going on there for the
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization, it was kind of the wild,
wild West for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the hustlers, the outlaws
and growers were all kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: making the moves to make the scene work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eventually the states have to step in
and institute regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that ends that whole kind of wild West
situation and brings it into a very much
[SPEAKER_02]: more controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what, you know, what you've seen is,
you know, a couple of states, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington, even in Colorado have to kind
of have these evolutions to the law
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, what was, what made
sense or what was found in good favor,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, six months ago, now all of a
sudden for some reason is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to change the law, we have to
evolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And emerging states are having that
opportunity to see some of these other
[SPEAKER_02]: states make the mistakes along the way and
hopefully put forth, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: their more strict legislation and
restricting legislation that much more
[SPEAKER_02]: easily because you can say, hey,
we'll look here, here's what happened in
[SPEAKER_02]: these states, didn't work out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're going to, we're going
to follow suit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they make start with these laws are a
little bit more restrictive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I, it's a, it's a mixed bag
of emotions for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love the fact that I can walk
down the street with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a few joints in my pocket or a bag of
tough Walker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I'm not going to get arrested for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I can have it in my car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can drive around with a plant and plants
in my car and nobody's going to pull me
[SPEAKER_02]: over for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That to me is, you know, amazing and mind
blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All at the same time, but also,
you know, there is this whole thing
[SPEAKER_02]: lurking in the back, you know,
in the, in the shadows of all this of
[SPEAKER_02]: corporate larger corporations making more
of an impact than they have up into this
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't mean, you know, the Philip
Morris's and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't, I'm not a big believer
in that they want to convert their
[SPEAKER_02]: customers yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are large, you know,
entities afoot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that to me is, you know, the,
to me, you know, whenever it's used to
[SPEAKER_02]: destroy the medical situation,
that's the scary part to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, it's kind of what
happened like in Washington, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate, I would hate it if they took away
the Oregonian residents ability to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: home grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think to me that would be unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that's happened to
our neighbors to the North.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you view that as the fundamentally
paramount right we need to protect?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I see that as a state taking,
creating the opportunity to make more
[SPEAKER_02]: financial and more stable financial gain
from the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's, you know, because when
you take away home grows, you're not just
[SPEAKER_02]: taking away, you know, that person or
patient's ability to cultivate their own
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine, but you're also taking away that
person's ability to, to go to their local
[SPEAKER_02]: retail store, to go buy the grow equipment
and the nutrients and the stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's, it's had this
incredible effect up in Washington where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really disrupted the retail,
the hydro industry retail stores there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many of them have had to close
after many, many years of operation due to
[SPEAKER_02]: the fact that home grows are no longer
legal there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, to me, as long as,
you know, everybody has their right to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce their own and not being forced
into a retail store to purchase cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: grown by, you know, whatever cultivation
group, then I'm okay with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as you take this, that,
that individual right away to produce and
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivate your own cannabis, that's a,
that's dangerous territory as far as I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the reason why I asked that
specifically is because the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: medical option that's being rolled out in
Australia, as much as a fast as I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: it to be, you could kind of boil it down
to be the case that they don't want you to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow your own, but you've got to accept,
you know, Philip Morrison's offering,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever that may be, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you, would you settle with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would you just be like, no,
I can not get down with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, yeah, no, I, that to me is,
that, that to me is, is not the best path
[SPEAKER_02]: moving forward for a medical program at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's, you know, I think for a
lot of folks, if they have the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if someone had the opportunity
to grow their aspirin, what you can with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They probably would, you know,
I think that cannabis, because it is such,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it can be absolutely
personalized medicine in the sense that
[SPEAKER_02]: people can find specific genetics that
target whatever they want to, whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: they're dealing with specifically,
that, you know, if the corporate groups
[SPEAKER_02]: that are mass producing whatever flower or
concentrate they're producing doesn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: that particular genetic, then that,
you know, individual may not find that
[SPEAKER_02]: combination of secondary metabolites that
hit all the right spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's very restrictive and
unfair to a patient.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and there, you know,
in the medical days here, even,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, even today we have folks who are
constantly, you know, those are the folks
[SPEAKER_02]: that are trying to find that strain that
really target and best effects,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, whatever condition they're
dealing with, or, you know, give them the
[SPEAKER_02]: best result.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's unfortunately very
restrictive and doesn't necessarily allow
[SPEAKER_02]: for that personalized medicine to occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, you can hit for some folks,
but, you know, to me it's an unfortunate
[SPEAKER_02]: way to pursue the medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Oregon specifically has been criticized
in the past with having what some might
[SPEAKER_01]: regard as, you know, kind of some laws
that are just, maybe you'd say a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: pedantic, I guess, like most notably the
whole naming thing, like you can't call
[SPEAKER_01]: certain strains what they're usually
called because it's deemed too appealing
[SPEAKER_01]: to kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Girls get cookies, Cinderella 99 and
bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can kind of see where they're coming
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where do you sit on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially dispensary just,
I think two weeks ago got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our first cease and desist for
using Scooby snacks at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, hey, look, I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I think one of the things you have to
have as a state that's pursuing legal
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is this appearance, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That you're hitting all the things that
the federal government said you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: do, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And making these and avoiding a trap,
you know, avoiding marketing to children
[SPEAKER_02]: is something the federal government has
absolutely spelled out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a, it's a, it's a fear
response from the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like fed say we should do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, let's do this one little thing
because this won't have a huge negative
[SPEAKER_02]: impact on anyone really.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've got to kind of play by their
rules to have to make the appearance that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're doing it right or we're doing it by
whatever, you know, protocol they just
[SPEAKER_02]: spit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now federal government hasn't spit out
very many protocols, but that was
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, does that make me change the
name of my strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But does it mean that the next time you go
into dispensary, it might say S snacks?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make the flower any worse?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that whole name thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's still, it's still
going to be the same, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic that I know and love.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you know, it's, I get why the
state did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me, it's, it's kind of a, you know,
it's sacrificing a pawn, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess, you know, kind of wrap up
this whole idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think was the most unexpected
negative thing to come out of
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization?
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be pretty unanimous with
everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, just the plummeting of the value of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone, we all knew it would
drop some, but I don't think anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: expected this, this big of a tumble in the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one was, you know, that's the one
that's hit everybody, I think the hardest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unfortunate though, a result of the
greed that ensued as soon as legal
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis was a thing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that states and would do
well by not allowing out of state
[SPEAKER_02]: investment as they go online to keeping
those businesses to state, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: resident businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everybody, you know,
I can't tell you how many, and we still
[SPEAKER_02]: see them and we still see hundred and 120
lighters going up all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you look at the glut that we
had back in December, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: over a million pounds in our rec system,
what is, what good is 120 new lights going
[SPEAKER_02]: to do for our state?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's the pricing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's just made it very,
very difficult for extremely talented,
[SPEAKER_02]: committed cultivators to stay in a
profitable game.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be so focused on the bottom
line that, you know, you start to see
[SPEAKER_02]: people slipping on things like inputs and,
you know, it's why all of a sudden salts
[SPEAKER_02]: are so much more attractive to some of
these, you know, to some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is, it can't, it is cheaper now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some organic practices that get
close, but when you get down to someone
[SPEAKER_02]: who's actually mixing their own raw salts,
it's, it's, it's tough to beat that
[SPEAKER_02]: financially.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's a pretty, that's about as
low as you can go on input cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, as the price plummets,
that focus on input cost becomes more and
[SPEAKER_02]: more significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there, you know, there's a lot
of things that are getting glossed and
[SPEAKER_02]: passed over because of the cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, it's just, that's,
that's the one thing that's most
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an individual, you know, not in Oregon,
obviously, but in say an illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, what do you think is your
best advice to someone in terms of what
[SPEAKER_01]: they can do on the individual level?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, and I guess what I mean by that
is not looking for an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, try to change the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's not really something you can
do as an individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can try to be more politically
active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: More so looking on like what, what's
something everyone can do in your opinion
[SPEAKER_01]: that will help collectively?
[SPEAKER_02]: Be a responsible grower and, and,
and, and not just responsible in your
[SPEAKER_02]: growing practices, but just how you
conduct yourself in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, don't, don't be a beacon of
light for attention for the wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be a beacon of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be a beacon of light for the right
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that goes to, you know,
you know, using, not using products that
[SPEAKER_02]: will potentially slowly kill your
customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's, it's a reputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like building a good reputation for
yourself as a responsible individual.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even in the, the illicit market
side of things will help to paint a better
[SPEAKER_02]: picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the collective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it starts on an individual level,
but what it does is it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if, if that responsibility is shared in
practice between many individuals,
[SPEAKER_02]: then when states do start turning and
looking at what's going on, perhaps there
[SPEAKER_02]: are some kind of pillars in the industry
at that point that can cross over and
[SPEAKER_02]: become leaders in the industry of the
legal industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've seen that here, you know,
we've definitely seen that here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where, you know, some very well respected
and good honest cultivators, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: came out of the shadows and stepped into
the limelight and became leaders for the
[SPEAKER_02]: state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's something that the
state pays attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and I think it also can be
very inspirational to those who haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten there yet, but, you know,
be, be responsible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep, keep your house in order.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do things the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, don't, don't do people wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely come back and bite you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say it really, it's not profound
advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but it's, you know, it's,
I guess if there's one thing that I say
[SPEAKER_02]: that I kind of try to carry around with me
all the time is, you know, just try to do
[SPEAKER_02]: things the right way, do people the right
way.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe not profound, but
nevertheless, it still needs to be said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that says something.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So final little section, our little quick
fire questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these ones, you can be as short or as
long as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently who's the best grower,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pig farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out pig farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, he definitely, um, and I, and I base
it purely on his Scooby snack results.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, he crushes that strain as good or if
not better than anyone that's ever run it
[SPEAKER_02]: that I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm a big fan of his work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely am a fan of Green Bodhi's
work here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's another phenomenal cultivator and a
phenomenal breeder at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next one is what's your prediction for the
hottest strain of 2018?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, whatever comes out with the biz and
that puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, if the hottest strain,
you know, this is, this is such a weird
[SPEAKER_02]: question for me because I don't
necessarily pay attention too much to this
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, you know, I, it looks like,
uh, via an Instagram, it looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: archives has some cool things in the
works, you know, uh, mean gene always has
[SPEAKER_02]: neat stuff cook coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming down the pike, uh, the gene finder
out at Wilcox farms, uh, even though,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he's exploring other people's
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he's doing phenol hunting like no
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't, I can't imagine that we
wouldn't see something amazing come out of
[SPEAKER_02]: his, his stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so there's, and I, you know,
even the guys at heroes, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: those guys are constantly breeding,
turning out good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if I could pick one
particular, uh, strain or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, but you know, there's at least a
short list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, some breeders and groups to certainly
pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I, I'm sure something will
come out of the cookies family or the Terp
[SPEAKER_02]: hogs or whatever, third gen or whatever,
you know, I'm sure it was something really
[SPEAKER_02]: big will come out of those groups,
but you know, the ones that I mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: prior, the ones that I'm really paying
attention, of course, whatever coastal
[SPEAKER_02]: does.
[SPEAKER_01]: That ties into the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could only pick one land race,
which one would it be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for me, because of the effect that I
really am looking for in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, it'd have to be a land race Afghani
and I can't say a particular one,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, uh, land race Afghani for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love sativas, but nothing beats a good
indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already a little high strung,
so too much sativa can you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: make me a little, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next one, what is the worst strain in
your opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got some serious traction behind
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cinex and I just don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and it has a close tie to here in
Portland and some very close friends of
[SPEAKER_02]: mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it's just one that, and I,
and loads of people love it around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, it's one of those ones that I just
don't get.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, there's just not much appeal to
me personally, but once again,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're dealing with pallets and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, some people like,
you know, I don't know, escargot and some
[SPEAKER_02]: people don't, some people like apples and
some people think they taste awful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so, you know, it's, so I get that part
of it, but yeah, that's one, that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: one strain for me that I just,
I've never understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So opposite end of the spectrum,
desert island weed, you can only pick two
[SPEAKER_01]: strains for the rest of your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the dog walker is definitely with me
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I was going to couple that with
something else, the lemon diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so what's, what's the lineage on that
one?
[SPEAKER_02]: The lemon D I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of one of those mystery
strains that, um, nobody, I've never
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten the full lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in fact, there's only a few people who
don't even cultivate it anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we call it the lemon D here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seemed like it came out of the Eugene
scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but just, just a phenomenal,
just amazing, just sour lemon flavor that
[SPEAKER_02]: just resonates for days on the palette.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only have one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: One word answer there, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, after my own heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one, you know, probably going to
be something you don't sell, but what's
[SPEAKER_01]: the worst grow product you've ever seen?
[SPEAKER_02]: The bio wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, I don't even know what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that resonates acoustics
and then it's supposed to get rid of bugs
[SPEAKER_02]: and increase your yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we sold a couple already this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's been around for, I don't know,
it's been around for 10 years now,
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 years in our industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just, you know, it's just one of
those junk science, lots of, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, no scientific data to back it up
devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure some people, you know,
see something who knows what, but you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, just anecdotal evidence at best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kind of touted, it's just another one
of those things that like, if this thing
[SPEAKER_02]: was so groundbreaking and it was,
you know, increasing everybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Ag would have these things all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess where you don't see them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: If something's really effective,
those guys will have it first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always.
[SPEAKER_01]: So final question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the best thing to happen to
cannabis period since you've been involved
[SPEAKER_01]: in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical cannabis for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was absolutely a huge turning point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know for myself, um, and a huge turning
point for a lot of individuals that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been involved with now for a decade plus
the, it gave it finally a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_02]: validation for the rest of the,
for the rest of the country and for the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of the world for that matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, the, the explosion of medical
cannabis, it's definitely probably in my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion, the best thing to come out of it
since I've started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a great answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that probably does just about
wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have any comments or shout outs
you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, I mean, obviously I want to
shout out to, if I can do my store roots
[SPEAKER_02]: garden supply in Portland, Oregon,
I definitely want to give a shout out to
[SPEAKER_02]: Biobiz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, there's a few of you out there,
Bob Hemphill, Pat out at Heroes,
[SPEAKER_02]: Pig Farmer, uh, you know, a couple others
I've probably forgotten, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a good friends of mine and great
cultivators and great people to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So surround yourself with good people,
people.
