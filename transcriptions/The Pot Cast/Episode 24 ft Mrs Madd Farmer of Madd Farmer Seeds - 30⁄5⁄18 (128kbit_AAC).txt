[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I find with the Australians is I
never get any negativity and I just think
[SPEAKER_02]: that is I think something everyone could
learn from, seriously, just never get any
[SPEAKER_02]: negativity or any rude anything from
anybody in Australia and I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
the podcast, a cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_00]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, we're excited to have the
other half of the mad combo, Mrs. Mad
[SPEAKER_00]: herself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as always, this episode was brought to
us by our sponsors.
[SPEAKER_00]: See it here now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know them, they're the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got mad farming gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably gonna want to hit that up by the
end of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: 420 Australia, number one 420 lifestyle,
no questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: OGS, if you want that top shelf,
it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into it guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, so a big thank you and welcome
to the other half of the deadly mad duo,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mrs. Mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little mix up to the normal question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you currently smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right now, I just finished smoking a
joint of the rainbow SSOG by smellboat
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that some like sneaky product
placement that's been popping up
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this intentional?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, actually it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just happened to sit down and roll a
joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually haven't been smoking a whole
lot of flour lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been smoking mostly concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't had any of our own dry flour
for a while because we've been pretty busy
[SPEAKER_02]: lately with everything going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, I was lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: My brother-in-law gifted me some of his
concentrates and some of his dry flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured I'd twist it up and sample
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No sneaky placement.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't think so anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky enough to be able to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question that I really want to
ask, so are you like a joints person
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily?
[SPEAKER_02]: Depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like to honestly smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, daily, lately,
most of the time throughout the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I have some extreme cream from
the Genizen Project.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're some local friends of ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a friend of ours named Bang
Mingo, he's gifted me some.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like from Dragon Scale, Emerald
Dragon out of Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: County.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Yeti OG live resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you find that you would smoke
flour exclusively if you could,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you very much like concentrates as
well?
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have a chance to smoke flour,
it would most likely have to be ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really picky when it comes to dry
flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just has to be right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like harshness.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like my throat to burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to choke from what I'm
smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my personal experience, dry flours,
my best bet is going with whatever we've
[SPEAKER_02]: grown personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But concentrates, like I said,
if we're out and we don't have access to
[SPEAKER_02]: something, any one of our good friends
usually have some really killer
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates that I can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like I said, I got like a couple of
buds that were gifted to me by Smell Boat
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeds, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now let's go all the way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I don't even know if I can
specifically remember my very first
[SPEAKER_02]: experience with cannabis as far as
cannabis itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking-wise, I was young.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost hate saying some of this stuff
out loud because I was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really young.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sixth grade, probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't tell you what it was because back
when nobody really named anything and they
[SPEAKER_02]: all had real generic names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody called it Green Bud,
Chronic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of, it's not like it is now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once, Prop 215 in California, went into
motion here and there was obviously a
[SPEAKER_02]: market for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when it seemed like strain names
became something that was real prevalent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Until then though, it was pretty much
called Green Bud, Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing really had a recognizable name
like it does today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you were growing up, it sounds
like cannabis was rather prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you grow up in the Emerald Triangle?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody always asks us, where are you
from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you live specifically?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could tell you specifically,
but nobody ever really knows where we're
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very small town.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in California my whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: As were with Matt, he traveled a bit as a
kid, but I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been pretty much in the Central
Valley area my entire life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, cannabis has been.
[SPEAKER_02]: For as long as I could remember,
I was really young.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can even remember as Matt has stories
about his parents when they were kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my dad hit it a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't really smoke a whole lot in
front of us when we were really small.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do remember a couple of times seeing
some plants growing in our backyard when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was a real small child.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at what age were you when you first
heard of like the first breeders and who
[SPEAKER_00]: was the first breeder you'd ever heard of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know because I would say
for me personally, like as far as breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: and the whole community, I've never been
seriously fascinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the way Matt is, he has an insane
brain for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He remembers anything and everything he's
ever read or heard or any research he's
[SPEAKER_02]: ever done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he has just an amazing brain for
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But me, I've never actually had a specific
interest or draw or any of that to like
[SPEAKER_02]: hunt as far as who all is in our
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel kind of like a jerk because I was
saying we just went to the Endo Expo in
[SPEAKER_02]: San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like a jerk because I really
don't know anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't spend much time online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty much a homebody and I spend
most of my time with either my family or
[SPEAKER_02]: my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like I don't I've never really I
don't spend all my time doing research on
[SPEAKER_02]: who's in the community and who does what.
[SPEAKER_02]: I focus mainly on what we do here and on
our own projects and in our own house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like pot was on the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about pot breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really something that I learned a
lot about once Mad started taking like a
[SPEAKER_02]: massive interest in really learning about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when I started to really just learn
anything like any real true knowledge
[SPEAKER_02]: there was to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before that, I would say was all probably
just wives tales and probably junk,
[SPEAKER_02]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we've all been fed one of
two of those wives tales before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's there's there are there's so
many of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with cannabis, like the entire almost
the entire industry seems to be kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: built on that in some way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, like my knowledge, anything,
anything that I have, I'm lucky I was
[SPEAKER_02]: blessed to learn directly from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just has an amazing mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I never really got involved in the like
I know a lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They spend a lot of time online and they
spend a lot of time researching strains
[SPEAKER_02]: and breeders and all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't have the time for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never really had a massive interest
in it, nor have I had a massive interest
[SPEAKER_02]: in searching the information on lots of
different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only what I'm currently interested in at
the time, I just don't have the space for
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we were to say, take a step back,
what was the first strain that you and Mad
[SPEAKER_00]: were maybe going together that kind of
really got you in wrapped in the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: saga of it all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have some pretty funny,
like really interesting stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: The very first few plants that I can
remember, like specifically remember him
[SPEAKER_02]: growing, they were actually outdoors and I
don't even think they had names,
[SPEAKER_02]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even remember how we went about
getting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We we pretty much, you know, now that
we've been growing for 20 some odd years
[SPEAKER_02]: longer, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But around there, you get to where you
have to keep notebooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would have to like go dig and try to
figure out when and what.
[SPEAKER_02]: But back then, I think those three plants
he had, I don't even think they had names,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he was growing those outdoors at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as like when he really took
like I knew we would be growing for the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of our lives when he first locked
down that last lavender plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He I remember the day he brought him home.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a weird day because I at the time I
had a full time job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working a full time job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that day when I was at work,
I got a phone call and they tell me that
[SPEAKER_02]: my identity had been stolen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody was using my Social Security
number and my full name and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: basically using my information to obtain
employment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this particular day when I got home,
from work, I did what most people would do
[SPEAKER_02]: in the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to call the police department and
file a report.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a police officer standing in
our living room taking this police report
[SPEAKER_02]: from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he comes walking in the door with his
lavender cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were in a brown paper bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had gotten from like our, you know,
our our small circle of friends that we
[SPEAKER_02]: had back back when.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, he walks in the door with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was it was actually Valentine's
Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he walks in the door with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of awkward.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course, the police officer in our
house, he has no idea what what he has
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're in a brown paper bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just one of those things that you
remember forever, because that really was
[SPEAKER_02]: the strain that started his major interest
in his complete love and passion for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and learning about the benefits
that it's given to not just him and me,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a lot of people that we know as far as
like a medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how did the Urkel then get in your
possession?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that came super short after.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, this is one of those things like as
far as like the lot of research being
[SPEAKER_02]: done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, he took Mad took such an
interest in really learning about just
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and proper ways to grow it and
the, you know, the ways to go about
[SPEAKER_02]: getting like the best flavors,
most residents and just all this stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that he had such a fascination for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was reading a lot about,
I don't know, you can call them rumors,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the stories that were going
around at the time about Urkel and
[SPEAKER_02]: Lavender and how they were set at the time
to be the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was dead set and proving that they
weren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we had this small circle of
friends and our friend at the time was
[SPEAKER_02]: super interested in scoring the Lavender
that we had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Mad wanted the Urkel that
he had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we tight circle, keeping keeping things
amongst ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had agreed we were.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were actually going to give him a cut
of our Lavender, which never turned out to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we got the Urkel and we've had her
ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to say that was just like maybe
a couple of months, possibly after we
[SPEAKER_02]: scored that Lavender.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've had them ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was just dead set on proving they
were different and that they were not only
[SPEAKER_02]: different, but different enough and worth
hanging on to both of them as different
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts for, you know, for as long as we've
had them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how come the other guy didn't get the
Lavender?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, he shortly after went to prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so he's yeah, he's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't seen him or heard from him in
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe he's still in prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, just one of those unfortunate
events.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how things go in this business,
especially if you're someone who may not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he was a good friend of Mad's and
known him for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they made that little deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had, you know, it was one of those
things we hadn't taken cuts yet and he had
[SPEAKER_02]: his.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got the Urkel and we hadn't taken
the Lavender cuts yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we had gotten to take it,
he had gone gone to prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how it turned out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lucky for us, we had we preserved both
of them because Madden and I were just
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about this the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it were and it would have turned out
any other way, this person that were,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, this person that we're talking
about who ended up in prison, he likely
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't have even hung on to the Urkel
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he was much his interest kind of
funny was much like people today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they move on to the next strain
and no one really hangs on to anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did we we hung on to him this whole
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the question I'd love to know
then is what project or what strain was it
[SPEAKER_00]: that really got you involved in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it sounds like Mad kind of had the
reigns of the chariot up until this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, at what point did you really kind of
become like a 50 50 in the partnership,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we know now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a crazy story, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because I don't I don't have a full
time job anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the time I was working a full time
job, one that was extremely stressful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how I did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was a manager in retail and I was on
a just a short vacation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a couple of day vacation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say maybe two days backed with
two more days to get like a total of a
[SPEAKER_02]: week long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had gone out to dinner and come
home and Mad was out back with our dog
[SPEAKER_02]: playing with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just one of those things, he pulled
something we think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, he has a long history with
health problems with his lupus and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he started to not feel good instantly
after this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew he was sick, but I wasn't
exactly sure what was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long story short, short.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ended up having to go to the emergency
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was in really bad shape and they
admitted him pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a lot of specialists come in and
they ended up having to do like an
[SPEAKER_02]: emergency surgery on him.
[SPEAKER_02]: They opened him up and had to figure out
what was going on with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they even at the time had told us that
he was likely to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had had us call in all of the family
and do that whole bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was in extremely bad shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had an entire set of plants,
full blown flower, needing care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't have a choice but to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't really my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I was stressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked a full time job and we have a
daughter, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would help him, you know,
on anything that he needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at this particular time, I just didn't
have a choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was in the hospital and he couldn't do
anything about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he ended up being in there for like
almost a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had no choice but to care for
everything we had running at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of, with my personality,
just adopted, I don't know, I kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: to have control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once he got home, I had a hard time
giving him back his space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I wanted to be in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like I needed to have input on
everything, which I'm sure just annoyed
[SPEAKER_02]: him to no end because he's thinking,
you're telling me what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is my space you cared for for a
month.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's like, I just really enjoyed
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that I liked it more than I
thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually like work started to stress
me out to the point where I just between
[SPEAKER_02]: that and with Mads health, it was so bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just easier if I were home to help
him with what he needed help with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, it made me just a better all around
mom to be home instead of giving my time
[SPEAKER_02]: to a full time position that I wasn't able
to really keep up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so helping him with the plants,
that's how I ended up getting thrown into
[SPEAKER_02]: it is that is how it happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got thrown into it and didn't have a
choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lucky for me, he's, he's a wicked
record keeper and he has stacks and stacks
[SPEAKER_02]: of books with dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every day he does something,
he writes notes and he gives a solid
[SPEAKER_02]: explanation for why he does what he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I learned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once he got out of the hospital,
he obviously needed my help for a while
[SPEAKER_02]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just his recovery alone was like a solid
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, he just over the time taught me
and I've taken over small things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here and there, like I am insistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do all of our cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have a preference and I am,
I'm a con, I'm a control freak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to have control of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I ended up doing what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I can, I can see where you're
coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was the first strain that you were
involved in the creation of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I guess I'm kind of wondering,
was this all happening before the creation
[SPEAKER_00]: of say the Tripoli Wicked or was it after
that just as a general timeline?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've always had some kind of,
some type of influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I, you know, when we, when we,
when we decided, like when we started
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding initially, it wasn't even about
like breeding for anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing it really for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, Mad had like this
interest in the comparison of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what are the true differences
between Urkel and Lavender?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you see it in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Offspring and so yeah, like this was his
project that he took on and that's where
[SPEAKER_02]: it started.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to remember, like I was his,
the person that gets to sit there while he
[SPEAKER_02]: bounces all these crazy ideas off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm always present listening to,
you know, what he thinks we should do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course he always asks my
input.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, I think the T-dub and the PJ lines
particularly are his babies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, my, one of my most hands on,
I would say is probably our Clementine
[SPEAKER_02]: selection, the Clementine male.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one for me was definitely my baby
because originally he had no interest in
[SPEAKER_02]: it and he wanted to kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just insisted no, that he was
definitely a keeper and I just,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was just something about him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was amazing and he ended up becoming a
really solid project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's one that I would say is
pretty much more mine, I'd say than his.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point for us to jump
off on because one of the questions we had
[SPEAKER_00]: submitted by our Patreon fans was why is
the Urkel Cross Clementine called Mrs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mad's Bubba?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like, for example, because you think
it's like a good representation of Bubba
[SPEAKER_00]: in seed form or is it like, what's the
backstory?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first off, never was really a fan of
naming strains, just to kind of put that
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never thought I'd do it, honestly swore I
never would, but the time came and we had
[SPEAKER_02]: to obviously start naming things,
so we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually not as easy as you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't really particularly like
it, but with that strain, like I was
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, California, for us particularly,
we started with the Prop 215 and when back
[SPEAKER_02]: when we had a bunch of dispensaries,
you know, open up and down the coastline
[SPEAKER_02]: and one of the common cuts that was always
floating around was the Bubba Kush and
[SPEAKER_02]: when we started searching through,
when we were doing our own searching and
[SPEAKER_02]: testing of these particular beans,
we had noticed that in this particular
[SPEAKER_02]: strain, the Urkel by Clementine,
it was showing tendencies and a physical
[SPEAKER_02]: appearance that did.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked a lot like the Bubba Kush and I
honestly thought that it was even had a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more of a better flavor,
I would say probably because of our Urkel,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's actually where it came from
plus the need obviously to name strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's just how it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes about in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're growing them, you're looking
at all of the traits that they express and
[SPEAKER_02]: that particular strain showed a lot of
just, it looked like a Bubba Kush and I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know, I kind of thought it was a bit
better myself, but you know, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a biased opinion, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do you feel about the original
Bubba?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just not like the biggest fan or?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we obviously don't have it,
but no, I obviously I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it or I wouldn't have looked to
try and make something that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: resembled in some way, shape or form or
was like my spin off version of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like basically, you know,
what we are always trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always trying to put something out
or always looking to do something better,
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you like to approach a project
with a very kind of preconceptualized idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of what you're trying to do, or are you
more so happy to just kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, trial things out and if
something hits a Winnie, you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: great, let's pursue that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a kind of a fair amount of
both really.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could sit and talk, you know,
plans all night long and we actually do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will sit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell him this is another reason why
we're like the house of notebooks because
[SPEAKER_02]: we will sit and try to write things down
and you jot your ideas down because as
[SPEAKER_02]: fast as they come, you also lose them if
you don't, you know, write them down
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about what we think would match
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we think about what we would like to
maybe hunt for, say, male in the future or
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe like what what we're looking for
both male and female and what do we want
[SPEAKER_02]: to like hunt and we're always hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always testing something that we're
not growing something without.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're always looking through
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we're always keeping in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always looking to make, you know,
what what's the next strain that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly make, what would be good pairing
up and always looking to make something
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no point in doing it if you're not
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a question I love to ask people you
mentioned, you know, you're always looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to pop new things, find new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the next thing you're most excited
or going to pop to look through?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how much I can say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to be kind of careful here because I
don't like to give away too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we're going to start looking
through our T-dub.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to start narrowing down some
selection there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I saw from maybe it was you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was mad that, yeah, there's going
to be like a filial release of pure T-dub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's got something.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got something in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, he bounces ideas off me all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, his he's talking about his next
angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to really dig deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the T-dub.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where he's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we talk we talk ideas all the
time and we do have a new female.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have two two relatively new
females in our collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hogsbreath, which we were gifted by
the Hogsbreath family.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are amazing people, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gifted us that female and we are for
sure going to take it to our Clementine
[SPEAKER_02]: male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that will make for something
amazing for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have that project at some point in
the works.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nothing too secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody pretty much knows about that
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: We scored a new female.
[SPEAKER_02]: The SR-71.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to see, you know,
what she has to offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, yes, another known kind of
purple strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's purple, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt and I were talking about this just
last night.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how there's some things that him
and I have grown before and we've really
[SPEAKER_02]: held on to things for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was I want to say we we had a Celine
for the longest time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had her for like six years and we just
eventually cut her loose.
[SPEAKER_02]: But she was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it takes a lot to to say you're
a solid keeper and can stay in our garden
[SPEAKER_02]: for that long, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So outside of Lavender and Urkel,
what has stayed in the garden for that
[SPEAKER_00]: long?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've got SEDC would be like a close
second or third.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've got our Clementine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's another thing, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will be digging through our Clementine
lines because we have we've got a we have
[SPEAKER_02]: F2, F3 and F4 stock of our Clementines
just sitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The threes we've dug through a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the F4s are the ones that I'm the most
interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are ones I'd like to make a
project of soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's another one that's been in our
garden for a while, our Clementine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Clementine, SEDC, I don't really know
how long like the I'm not really even sure
[SPEAKER_02]: how long the Urkel and Lavender have been
in our garden exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know they've been in our garden
since pretty much since Mad got real
[SPEAKER_02]: serious about growing and he, you know,
he knew he wasn't going to let him go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the SEDC was the one I want to say he
acquired around that same same same time
[SPEAKER_02]: shortly after.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the Clementine also we've had for
quite some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Northern Lights, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why I forget her.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had her for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say maybe six or seven years,
possibly somewhere around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you know where she comes from at
all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he was gifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Northern Lights was gifted to us by a
friend of Mad's.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, like, what of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what of that he has said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I should have asked him that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could tell you more on that,
because that was something that he
[SPEAKER_02]: actually had to direct.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a cut that was gifted to us from a
gentleman he met on one of the boards way
[SPEAKER_02]: back.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, we've had it for about
six or seven years, but I honestly can't
[SPEAKER_02]: even remember his name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to ask Mad on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what are some tips or tricks you
might have to just kind of keep plants
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy over the long term in the way you
guys have with these cuts we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleanliness is probably the the biggest
thing in your space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleanliness is the biggest thing that you
could do no matter what.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleanliness is the most important for
healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Air flow is also just small things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Common sense with the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, you'd be surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apply common sense to everything you do
with the plant and you keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really take that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, we try to keep we try to keep it
as organic as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mad mixes it up quite a bit when he's in
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like a little scientist in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as me, when I'm anything in veg
and our mothers or our fathers,
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say, just I do I like to keep
them as healthy as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just control any obviously a clean area
and keeping your bugs gone or out under
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleanliness controls all of that,
believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't take much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, we use really basic
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of my staples would be like Dirt MD
and Sea Crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use those religiously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Micro MD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love those products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think you just hinted,
do you tend to more look after the
[SPEAKER_00]: fathers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I look after pretty much anything
that's in anything that's in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep those going 24-7.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look after our fathers, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you what are like some tips for
maintaining dads?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's a that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know some people tend to I know
some people have issues trying to maintain
[SPEAKER_02]: males.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I just I find if I keep them,
you can keep them cut back more,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to keep them cut back and smaller
than I would females.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can control them more that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that's really nice
for like I was telling Mad when if we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be running like a pollination,
one of the things that I like to do is I
[SPEAKER_02]: will keep my like if I have a couple of
them, I always they're always in the same
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I always have at least three males at
the same time in any given space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I like to do is I won't cut on
them if I know we're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I won't cut on them is
because they will actually compete with
[SPEAKER_02]: each other and they'll force each other to
like throw pollen faster and more pollen,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, which is really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're getting ready to do something
like that, like we're going to run a
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination run, I'll leave them in there
and I won't cut on them at all during that
[SPEAKER_02]: time frame, because then when I do throw
them in there to throw pollen,
[SPEAKER_02]: they seem to be a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like they're competitive,
basically, and they'll throw a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen and they'll produce faster,
which is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have you ever noticed any change?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so maybe this is a bad question
because I'm going to completely contradict
[SPEAKER_00]: myself here, but people say when you
maintain mothers in poor conditions over
[SPEAKER_00]: time, they deteriorate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wondering if a certain similarity
would happen with males and how it would
[SPEAKER_00]: manifest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess because, you know,
you maintain things nicely, you probably
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't see that anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're saying you wouldn't think that,
but I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will put plants to the paces.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will stress them out like you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would not believe I mean to where they
look ugly and sad and completely unhappy
[SPEAKER_02]: with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something you have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to know, you know, what are
their limitations?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do they like?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are they tolerant to?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they react when you do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stress them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make them ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the things to plants,
too, they will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen they will deteriorate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if they're not in like optimal
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've also found, too, that even though
they will do that, I can turn that around
[SPEAKER_02]: also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of have to stress them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to stress them to see,
you know, what they do when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: stressed, how they handle a stressful
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to introduce that kind of
environment to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the males do they know they they
they have obviously differences because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a male plant versus female.
[SPEAKER_02]: But.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's kind of common sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kind of just watch them and you
can learn from them as you watch them
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty common sense basic thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I remember last time I spoke to Matt,
he said that you guys were running Hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: and Organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, like, does that mean you've got
two different setups or you do like a
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid type of thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, from my understanding on that,
yeah, I was wondering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my recollection of that was.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was referring to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're always in soil, but my
understanding was he was actually
[SPEAKER_02]: referring to organics and synthetics
because he does he he does use some
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic nutrient lines, and I believe
that's what he was actually referring to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we're dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, yeah, he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does try.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does try to keep it as organic as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now from when we first really started
heavily growing, it wasn't as easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organics weren't as big of a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot less nutrients and there
were a lot less lines on the market back
[SPEAKER_02]: then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now he has a lot more options
available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we both were always willing to try,
you know, something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always have somebody approaching you,
asking you if you're interested in trying
[SPEAKER_02]: a product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always willing to try something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't like to personally take in a
bunch of stuff I know I won't be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: use or I'm not going to have time to get
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am always interested in something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: I in our veg space, I always try to keep
it organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, I find as long as I'm doing my
transplanting like I should, I rarely have
[SPEAKER_02]: to give them much of anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, my staples are like
pretty much dirt MD, micro MD and C crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I'm transplanting my plants
appropriately and I'm maintaining
[SPEAKER_02]: everything the way I should, that's pretty
much all I have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I throw it over and it's in Mad's
hands at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I give him big healthy plants and then he
gets to go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you ever like to do flower runs
of your own or are you just happy with the
[SPEAKER_00]: end product you get already?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything that we do, we do as a team.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm super lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say he is too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everything we do, we do as a team.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do always have something going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's never a time when there aren't
plants growing in our space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of funny because our
daughter was in here the other day and
[SPEAKER_02]: she's like, you know, most people grow up
on house plants, me, pot plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, she's she's been around them her
whole life since the day she was born.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's known the pot plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of funny because like we do,
we grew up with house plants, not pot
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, but she's grown up with pot
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So had that that proper upbringing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, proper upbringing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, must be right, because she's like oh,
she walks around carrying a four point
[SPEAKER_02]: five grade point average.
[SPEAKER_02]: She must be must be doing something pretty
all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I was meant to ask you
earlier, but we'll just loop back on
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned which stock you guys were
interested to pop from yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one could be real, could be
hypothetical if you had to or maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: already are planning on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popping stock from another breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would it be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a hard question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two, I don't want to offend anybody,
but that is like such a massive list to
[SPEAKER_02]: choose from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Off the top of my head, because this is an
off the top of my head sort of question
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's going to hold you accountable,
don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they'll all hate me in silence.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just with you asking that question in
the moment, I have a serious interest in
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously playing around with some of Duke
Diamond's gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't help it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our friends, like I was saying
earlier, Bang Mingo, he's one of my he's
[SPEAKER_02]: my go to concentrates guy right now when
I'm desperate.
[SPEAKER_02]: He always hooks me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been growing some of Duke Diamond's
gear and he's actually growing our gear in
[SPEAKER_02]: there, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his plants, I mean, everything coming
out of Duke Stable is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So off the top of my head, that's what
comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, I've been listening to a
lot of your podcast too, and Mr. Bob
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemphill, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got some very beautiful plants that
he's working with there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I imagine he would have something of
interest, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to remember, though, we're always
going to be limited to space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything that we pop, it has to be
worth our time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it just has to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, those are two solid choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they but I also I also have some
of yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some of your genetics, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have I want to know what out of
everything you have, if you could if you
[SPEAKER_02]: could out of everything you have,
if you could share one of your strains
[SPEAKER_02]: with everybody, which strain would it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the licorice mama.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I sent you that one as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why this one in particular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like it's two strains I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm super down with that, like cross
together to make that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can definitely get behind that one is
like my own work more so than a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, I was like super,
super disappointed with like the Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: Durban and people because I love licorice
and people always said that was like the
[SPEAKER_00]: licorice thing, you know, like the anise
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just it just wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like it was just the most generic
sweet smell I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've literally bought like shitty
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back when I was a noob and I didn't know
what I was doing, like not because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: buying feminized seeds, but I was
literally just on like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the very beginning of my whole grow
journey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those shitty feminized seeds I
had had the exact same smell as the
[SPEAKER_00]: Durban, just this generic sweet smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't get how people can get
licorice from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've created something that I feel is,
you know, very licoricey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Admittedly, you know, it's it's got some
gogog in it, which is a strain that's also
[SPEAKER_00]: known to have a bit of licorice in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's obviously probably tap
thing back into that to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's it's very much a licorice
whereas the Durban, I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, anyone who says this is licorice has
got quite an imagination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we talking like a black licorice,
though?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's very black licorice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's and so that was why I was a bit
let down with the Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one, I would be interested to
definitely look in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it would be a good one to
check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any of the Raspberry Mama ones are
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the tests have come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it seems to be quite dominant,
so you get a lot of raspberry in most
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that regard, I'd say look at the mum
you like and go from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I am curious about this because I
know I've heard this question when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: selecting for like a male, your male
selection, is there something that you
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically look for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm like you, I stress the hell out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needs to survive the gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one, but I can't stand like auto
flowering males because I for a while I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought that was like the norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized I was just stressing
everything too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then I took a step back and I was
like, oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's a few little inside
tricks like Duke.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'll share one here, which do share
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope he doesn't mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you when you get real serious,
you can start to do some crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can get your man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take clones of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got, you know, backups and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you grow all your males out to a
certain size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you like, you know, get all tease
the soil or whatever the medium is out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually make judgments on it
based on the size of the root ball and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that, which is not immediately
apparent otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be, you know, pretty
indicative because on females like a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people think that yield is proportional
to the number of nodes on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not true at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally proportional to the root mass
in most cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, like having having a really
solid root system is something I value on
[SPEAKER_00]: a male, which I think people don't look at
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be with I think, too,
something people don't look at either is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, starting with or using just a
more mature plant in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: As in like the males more mature?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, even female or male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just maturing it, you know, letting it
grow, letting it fill in its container,
[SPEAKER_02]: just letting it really grow and express.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times people with females,
too, they'll sex them and just straight
[SPEAKER_02]: throw them into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to mature and we like our plants
mature before we, you know, flower
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just get a better result.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when they're naturally kind of
already transitioning to flower because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're that mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's just like like him and Matt and
I were talking about this the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you think is going to make a better
mother, a 15 year old girl or a 30 year
[SPEAKER_02]: old woman?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's it's interesting to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I because a lot of people talk about like
Bob Hemphill, we'll loop back to that for
[SPEAKER_00]: a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about the the four way and it
kind of brings this point in mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: like does a mother that's really old make
worse offspring than the same cut when it
[SPEAKER_00]: was younger?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, does it affect the seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I honestly I I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I there's so many there are so many
aspects to which you have to consider,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, from with each plant,
you know, the growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it stress?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you use, you know, new things with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, there's so many different factors
that can play into a plant doing different
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so hard to pinpoint, like,
you know, to a scientific level,
[SPEAKER_02]: what caused what?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really tricky question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't know, but I do find that
with us here we have lavender and Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very old plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're extremely old.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I want to say around 2000 or
so, maybe longer, maybe less.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said back then, you didn't really
keep dates on stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just kind of hung on to something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when those plants are really healthy,
they produce beautiful seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it's just the factor of whether
or not you're you have a healthy plant
[SPEAKER_02]: versus the age of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the far better way to phrase that
question would be like deteriorate cuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if a cut has known to deteriorate
it and like the bud you get off it now is
[SPEAKER_00]: just nowhere near what it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you make seeds with it, are the
offspring going to be similar to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're going to have flavor
profiles similar to the deteriorated
[SPEAKER_00]: version now or to when it was fresh and
much more fuller and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like its original self?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder about that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, there's so many factors that
go into, well, when you're making seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, there are so many things
you'd have to look at, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: with that particular grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you noticed anything in particular
with your testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I lost the oldest cut I had
not too long ago, sadly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, it's, I mean, but even then it
was only like three and a half,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, no, I think it was about three
and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, so I don't know if that's really
old enough for stuff to really
[SPEAKER_00]: deteriorate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it just means I've taken care of it
well, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, not, not in that period of time,
unfortunately, I haven't noticed anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are times where,
um, I even, Mad and I have talked,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, well, we're, we'll complete a grow and
we'll be like, we'll, we'll ask each
other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think maybe this is showing signs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it has degraded at all as far as like
the flower, the finished product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are times where we will think,
yep, it is, it's just old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'll have your next run and
you'll be like, Nope, she's every bit as
[SPEAKER_02]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes I, I wonder if it's a per
strain thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be, um, based off of that
particular run you had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, there's so many factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I haven't us here have,
we haven't had any particular experience
[SPEAKER_02]: where I would say, you know, we've ran,
we've, we've created seeds with like our
[SPEAKER_02]: older cuts, which we have both the Urkel
and lavender, even the SEDC.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's older now too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of our stuff is older at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but as far as like how the seeds are
created, um, there's certain things that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have picked up on that are different from
plant to plant, but I haven't actually
[SPEAKER_02]: noticed anything as far as like a
degradation hand handed down in like the
[SPEAKER_02]: offspring to the seeds, nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I did notice, uh, as far as
breeding goes with our, our Clementine,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Clementine line, um, whenever we make
seeds, the Clementine seeds, they come out
[SPEAKER_02]: every time almost without any stripes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just almost like little blondies
is what I would call them, little blondie
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're even kind of have like a weird
shape to them, but they're always super
[SPEAKER_02]: viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: They pop in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instantly they're fast and they're just
really strange looking seeds, but they,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you never worry about them because
they always pop and they're really fast to
[SPEAKER_02]: pop, but they just look so different,
so different than the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are your tips for picking them
out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, um, I, it depends on, um, it depends
on the strain to start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for me, I like to see a good,
I like to see consistently what the
[SPEAKER_02]: females look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we'll start there first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I want to know what the females of
that line come out looking like before I
[SPEAKER_02]: would even consider whether I want to even
look at a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if Matt and I are, um, going through,
say a particular strain and we're testing
[SPEAKER_02]: and we find, um, really worthy keepers,
uh, within those beans, then we would
[SPEAKER_02]: consider maybe a male and that would be
worth looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so at that point, maybe we would.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, structurally, like with our
Clementine male, when I chose that male,
[SPEAKER_02]: I chose him because he came out and he
actually looked like what you would
[SPEAKER_02]: attribute to a female plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: His structure was just super squatty.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't have hardly any node spacing and
I just loved him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was pretty and he had just such a deep,
dark green to his leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just a beautiful, um, plant and I
just really liked him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for him, I liked his structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but with our PJ male, he's a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: He also has, um, he resembles the
appearance of a female plant, but I've
[SPEAKER_02]: liked the PJ female.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, there's more, a lot more node
spacing than say with the Clementine male,
[SPEAKER_02]: way more node spacing on the PJ male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but really with this one, he's got a
instant smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Develop, um, developing resins to him
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just unique colors running all up and
down the stems and the pedials of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So him, it was just about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had a smell and structurally he,
he resembled pretty identically a female
[SPEAKER_02]: that was a keeper for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of why we chose him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those seeds themselves, were they
quite old when you pop them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a germination tips you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well on the Clementine male,
that one was hunted a while ago and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not really sure how old those beans were.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, I would have to ask mad,
but on the PJ beans, I'd say they were
[SPEAKER_02]: probably about eight years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say maybe older eight,
but, um, yeah, they were a pain in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't, the PJ beans, didn't even
want to pop for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a real hard time with them and I'm
not a fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly, I struggle with the beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if they don't want to pop,
they just irritate me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually mad deals with the beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they tend to agree with me more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but on the beans, there's a couple of
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some people like to just soak,
like soak them in a dark space in a cup,
[SPEAKER_02]: see if they, a taproot will show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some people like the whole paper towel
method.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, moisture and paper towel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we usually will use, uh, if we think
they're going to be a tough crack,
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll usually soak them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it depends what your issue is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can scuff them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes that helps them pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different things that you
can try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's the, the Jebrellic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't used it yet, but, um,
that's only because I haven't dealt with
[SPEAKER_02]: the bean yet that we couldn't even try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, usually you can, usually you can
help them along in some way, shape or
[SPEAKER_02]: form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we haven't really encountered a problem
to where we couldn't get at least,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, some beans from a strain to pop,
but the PJs were a little bit trickier,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we obviously were still able to select
from those, which was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to loop back to one of
your previous breeding projects I was
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever happened to the Space Queen male
you guys were using in the Evil Queen
[SPEAKER_00]: project?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we killed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just didn't make the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, everybody really did.
[SPEAKER_02]: People still ask us about that to this
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we still even have some of the beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if people ask, I'll totally give
them, um, we do have some, and there is
[SPEAKER_02]: some really interesting things to be seen
in there, but Mad, Mad and him and I both,
[SPEAKER_02]: we hate anything that has any tendency to
show instability.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just, you know, nobody, you just,
that's like the most dreaded thing when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're hunting through seeds and you're,
you know, you have that feeling or you're
[SPEAKER_02]: concerned about finding something that's
not stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it came to those, it just,
we didn't trust them and it just left us
[SPEAKER_02]: uneasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for that reason, we knew we could find
a much better male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we killed him.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel bad saying it, but it's
true.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, do you think it came from
maybe more of the chem side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics or was it more the Space Queen
side of things?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say Space Queen side.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a, Ooh, it was a, that was a,
a stinky plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it also too, it had that,
that, that pineapple expression that was
[SPEAKER_02]: really like known to be on the Space Space
Queen side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but like I said, that one wasn't even
one that really interested me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that was, that was one that was really
more of Mad's thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, back then when he had acquired the
Urkel and the lavender, the reason why he
[SPEAKER_02]: even got into the whole Space Queen side
of things is because he was really
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in proving that there is a
difference between the Urkel and lavender.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he thought that that Space Queen,
uh, male might be the way to go about
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that by showing the different
expressions in the, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the, in the seeds that we created from
both parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so that was his main reason for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once he pretty much got the
answer he was looking for, and he was
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much done with that male,
we just decided to move on to something
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when we stepped into the T-dub
and the, um, the PJ project originally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we had just decided to move on to
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted something obviously more
stable is what we were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the past, Mad has hinted that he
thinks T-dub might've somehow found its
[SPEAKER_00]: way into the creation of Tangee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spoken to a few other people about
these quite credible sources and they say
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not so sure that's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think on that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, of course I have an opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't think I'll share.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, I, look, I, I gotta be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, on this particular topic, I kind of
hate this topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this was a topic that was actually
brought to, I'll say Matt, it was his
[SPEAKER_02]: brought to his attention by a few
different people, um, very credible
[SPEAKER_02]: sources and breeders to in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this wasn't something that was a
thought of his.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was something that was brought to
him, uh, by outside sources originally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where this whole entire thing
started up, um, up with to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think basically, uh, like I have my
opinion, he has his, other people have
[SPEAKER_02]: theirs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically him and I, all that we ever ask
of anybody is if anybody uses ours or
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody else's genetics for that matter or
their strains, I just ask that people are
[SPEAKER_02]: honest and say they say what they use and
we try to live by that the best that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which is another reason why we don't
work any, we try not to really work
[SPEAKER_02]: anything outside because if you're only
working what you have, then you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can trust it and you're not being
dishonest about what you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but as far as him, you know,
kind of creating that topic, that didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: come from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was brought to him by other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, as far as his opinion on that,
I would, I would, I would much prefer you
[SPEAKER_02]: ask him about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we just don't like to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not looking to start any trouble in
the industry for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, just basically, I just think
everybody could benefit from honesty and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, it would, it would, it's in the best
interest to have the genetics too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody just being honest about what
they're working and you know, saying what
[SPEAKER_02]: it is, is actually what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I really have to say on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just on a topic you mentioned then
about like not really bringing in new
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, do you ever feel like it's self
limiting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Limiting maybe if, um, I guess if,
if our entire game plan was based off of
[SPEAKER_02]: just looking to pump out as many strains
as we possibly could, um, if we were on
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole, you know, strain of the month,
what's everybody interested in in the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would say maybe so maybe we were
limiting ourselves, but I'd like to say
[SPEAKER_02]: more that we just have, um, some
guidelines that we've set for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a set of standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of keeps us, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps us kind of working, staying away
from what everybody else is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you know, at least we're working
things that we have true confidence in is
[SPEAKER_02]: how we both look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not opposed to bringing,
bringing things in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it just has to be really worth
bringing in to even bother, I guess I
[SPEAKER_02]: would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, like you, you have to give up
all your time and energy to keep these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really got to be worth giving your
time and energy to, to keep it alive in
[SPEAKER_02]: your stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I would say we don't limit
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have really high standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like with that being said about the
willingness to bring in something,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it was worthy, is there anything that's
caught your eye and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that might be one of the things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can't say a particular strain,
um, like not, not as a particular strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I have told mad one of the things that
I would like to really start looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: is a really good CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because for me, I've actually been
getting into some really awesome CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates lately and they work really
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have fibromyalgia and it just really
does, it helps with all my aches and pains
[SPEAKER_02]: and just the overall shitty feeling that
you can have throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just works really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as bringing in something new,
that's my personal interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I want to find some like a really
good CBD strain that I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so again, if it's something that we're
going to bring in, it's gotta be something
[SPEAKER_02]: that either he has an interest in,
or I have an interest in, or it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit him and I in some way,
because that's like everything we work is
[SPEAKER_02]: based off of that to start with,
you know, everything else is just like a
[SPEAKER_02]: bonus, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what would be one of the current
males you'd love to cross to a CBD strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that was one of the questions I had,
like what would be the first CBD offering
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys would want to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, I think for, I think if you were
to ask, I'm just saying based off of my
[SPEAKER_02]: own personal experience, but I think if
you were to ask Mad, I think if him and I
[SPEAKER_02]: were to, to have a discussion on,
we were to throw a male in there that we
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot of, both have a lot of
confidence in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say we both have a lot of
confidence in our Clementine male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say definitely can't go wrong
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus he's, he seems to be doing pretty all
right in, um, in all the other projects
[SPEAKER_02]: that we've used him in so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do you like to test your new
lines?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just like to, you know,
pop 10 seeds, pop how many seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just give some to your friends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's your general kind of way of
doing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, well, we, of course we like to grow
everything that we like to always test our
[SPEAKER_02]: own stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's really hard to try to form an
opinion about a strain based off of just
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're seeing coming from other
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we also though keep in mind,
we love to see, uh, other growers growing
[SPEAKER_02]: our genetics too, because that gives you,
um, some solid insight as to what the
[SPEAKER_02]: everyday person who grows your beans are
going to get, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives, and it also gives that kind of
perspective to the, to the public to see
[SPEAKER_02]: what, you know, a random person who,
who buys your beans gets, and this is what
[SPEAKER_02]: they were able to get when they popped
your beans and they grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do put our beans out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Oh, there's a lot of people who grow
our genetics and we don't really know
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's a lot of people who actually
appear to rep us quite aggressively
[SPEAKER_02]: online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do like to put out there,
like, believe it or not, we met them
[SPEAKER_02]: online.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, that's the only way we know them is
because they've acquired our genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, because all their representation of us
is basically just what they have come
[SPEAKER_02]: across on their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do, um, we both have tried to spend
a little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we asked that our growers,
you know, tag us in like our own genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: that they've grown so we can repost them
and show people like, this is what the
[SPEAKER_02]: general public is also getting with our
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we find that to be helpful,
but we, um, we have, uh, some personal
[SPEAKER_02]: friends too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We share with, but we like to test all of
our own stuff first, first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just referencing social media,
I've noticed that since we first chatted
[SPEAKER_00]: to Matt over a year ago, your guys social
media presence definitely ramped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that intentional?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think it's possible to survive
without a strong social media presence as
[SPEAKER_00]: a breeder?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I do think it's possible to survive
without social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's harder because a lot of people like
to have that contact with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one of the things that Matt
offers that a lot of people don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's willing, he'll, he'll talk to
anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, he tries to answer everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, in fact, I personally, I feel like
people get more time from him than I do,
[SPEAKER_02]: believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I honestly, I have such respect
for it because a lot of, um, a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: growers, something that, you know,
if you ever ask, ask them, they'll tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you they will message breeders over and
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody will get back to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time they get blocked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I do, I love the fact that mad
will, he will sit down and he will give
[SPEAKER_02]: lengthy responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: He will answer anybody's questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I do, I think that's awesome that
he does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one of the things that
he does very different from a lot of other
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just the fact that he allows access to
himself, I think is big, but I do think
[SPEAKER_02]: you can survive without social media,
but it would be a whole lot harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about the way female
growers and breeders are perceived within
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, you don't actually see a lot
of representation of women in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think there's probably a whole lot
more women growing women growers and
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding than, than we know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to, I don't want to say
something that's going to be offensive,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think it has something to do with,
I think that there's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously it's like a male dominated
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but there's, there's something,
uh, about the way it's changed a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit because of social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have, um, I don't know it kind of like
ordinary people feel more like,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, kind of like somebody famous I'd say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they really enjoy that
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, um, with the female
growers, you're not really going to see
[SPEAKER_02]: that as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they just kind of do their thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, I, I just don't see them out like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you do the only women you really
see heavily in the industry are usually
[SPEAKER_02]: dressed up and you know, meant to be
handing out dabs in a tight tank top.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I don't think that's like a fair
representation of women in the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's basically what I've seen from
my perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the criticisms put forward that
I've heard at least is that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: seemingly like a dichotomy within the mind
of the average male smoker within the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community in that, uh,
you know, a lot of guys within this
[SPEAKER_00]: criticism will supposedly be like,
yeah, we want more female breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'd love female breeder,
whatever, like that whole type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, but then as soon as a girl puts
herself forward as maybe something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, the immediate assumption is,
Oh, you're just fucking around in your
[SPEAKER_00]: boyfriend's grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do you feel like that's quite an
accurate representation of the way women
[SPEAKER_00]: are met in the industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think, um, there's a lot of,
I think there's probably a lot of men in
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry that probably have that
perspective that they don't want to share
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to share this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to share this with women.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Men and women, we think very different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's not a knock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we work the way we work
because this is how it, this is the
[SPEAKER_02]: balance of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really think that, um, but I think too,
when you've got something that they've
[SPEAKER_02]: started out with and they were used to it,
like being theirs, I don't know that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're so confident or comfortable
sharing that per se.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's face it, you do not have to be a
dude to grow good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just don't any think of it like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was, when I was a kid, um,
all the men in my family were all either
[SPEAKER_02]: in the military or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them were away most of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Women, they ran shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ran the entire house.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cooked dinners.
[SPEAKER_02]: Men went to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They came home at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had dinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: They went to bed and they did the work
process all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time you saw them was on the
weekends when they were doing a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: things around the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let's face it, women ran stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: They cooked dinners.
[SPEAKER_02]: My grandma, she had two vegetable gardens
in the backyard and my grandpa did tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: them on the weekend, but my grandma ran
stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was like, that's kind of,
I think we forget how much, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: hands on women really do have just an
everyday stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think they forget that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is maybe like a harder one to
answer because it's just so blunt and to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point, but do you feel it's harder for
women to gain recognition or respect
[SPEAKER_00]: within the general industry as it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you for a fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, prove a point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you just approve a point,
open up my Instagram page and then open up
[SPEAKER_02]: Mad's Instagram page and look at our
followers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: If something happened to Mad, all you guys
would be fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if you don't have contact with me,
how are you going to get our beans?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like seriously, if something happens to
him, you guys need to be able to talk to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I, I do see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that some, some people have no
problems, but there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a vast difference between,
um, the, the people that view me and him
[SPEAKER_02]: as equals, despite how many people he
tells, he's like, I'm right by him.
[SPEAKER_02]: His side, I, every bit I need him as much
as he needs me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how we work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're 100% a team, but you can see it like
clearly, um, just in the respect that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're given, not by everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not singling out everybody,
but you can clearly see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I was just going to say was
one of the counteracting views that I had
[SPEAKER_00]: seen to this discussion was that as we
mentioned earlier, it could fundamentally
[SPEAKER_00]: also just be a little bit of a
under-representation problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and what I think is meant by that is
the fact, like if you were to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, look at how many male
breeders there are and of those male
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders, how many have gone on to become
super successful?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just in the fact that maybe they're
known, but they've actually got something
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really well regarded and it kind
of stands the test of time or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you set the bar that high,
it's only actually, you know, like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe 20, 30 people who really
meet that criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you kind of get what I mean when I
say there's an under-representation,
[SPEAKER_00]: like maybe we just need more females
contributing stuff and then we would
[SPEAKER_00]: easily see stuff rise to the top because
it is the cream of the crop type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do think, um, uh, I think that is,
that's actually probably, um, again,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's one of those factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was just saying, there's lots of
factors that contribute to why things are
[SPEAKER_02]: the way they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, you have to remember too,
the seed industry, the way it kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: started up was mainly because you had
legalization popping up in the States,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, here and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you had people who were ordering seeds
overseas and whatnot, but that's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: what started the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you don't, it was guys,
it was, it was the men in the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: that were doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of it was again, social media
has really kind of, uh, kicked that into
[SPEAKER_02]: like a much higher gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was men that, um, it's the guys
that were doing a lot of these little
[SPEAKER_02]: little internet deals and trading and
sharing and swapping genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is what built this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the same time, I can understand
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is why you probably don't see,
um, a lot of female faces, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: behind genetics and breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think you will see more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what I was just going to say with
that being said, you just recently partook
[SPEAKER_00]: in your first breeding panel over the
weekend, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did that go for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the experience like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually, it was actually cold that
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that I got to meet two other ladies in
the industry, both very nice and smart
[SPEAKER_02]: ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Elena, she's with the green fire
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's, she's young.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but she's really sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's coming up in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I, I spent a little bit of time
hanging out with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a really cool chick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, people should check her out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other lady on the panel,
her name is, um, ginger doer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that lady right there is an amazing
example for, um, just growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, have you, have you looked into her at
all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you happen to see any?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to say, you sent me the name
just earlier and I was going to look into
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but I haven't got a chance to just
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, both of them, um, Elena is more into
like, yeah, she's more into like our side
[SPEAKER_02]: of things, you know, like the,
you know, breeding and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, ginger is, it has like this
massive commercial background and she just
[SPEAKER_02]: has some of the coolest stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seriously, the knowledge in that
girl's mind puts most of the people to
[SPEAKER_02]: shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, she's just, uh, she's an amazing
example of a girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, she's like a grower on so many levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you can track down an interview
with a female, she would be, I'm mind
[SPEAKER_02]: blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be a killer interview to
listen to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she has so much knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, like I have a little bit of a
crush on her.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's so just, she's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a mother of five for starters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, she's also like into painting and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done a little bit of like research on
both of the ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they were both very nice and
interesting, but she's, um, got an
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural background and she's been
into like growing pots since a youngster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So her story is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she just, the knowledge in her mind is
just, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you could track down an
interview with somebody, she would be a
[SPEAKER_02]: cool one to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send her information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to stretch your mind back now
to the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked Mad and Smelly this question,
but I wasn't able to ask you in the
[SPEAKER_00]: interview, did anyone bring you anything
at the cup that you were really surprised
[SPEAKER_00]: by?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I do remember this question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, I got, I'm going to be honest here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first I'm going to say to have that
much cannabis in that small of a space,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have honestly thought I would see
a much higher grade and, um, a wider range
[SPEAKER_02]: of really killer weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really am surprised that I didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there were people that brought us
some really killer examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there were a lot of people who,
I don't want to sound, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: sound like that, but I'm going to just say
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people brought us, um,
samples of our genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically they had got our beans,
popped them, grew them, and brought us
[SPEAKER_02]: finished product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was some of the most impressive
that we did see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one other really kick ass example of
some solid smoke I not only saw,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I was lucky enough to smoke,
um, was from Duke Diamond and it was his,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, his lavender.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying that was really killer weed,
but there was, there was, um, there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: good five or six people that brought me in
mad personal samples of their own grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was some really well grown
cannabis in there, some outdoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor, I mean, just really nicely grown,
nice, well done product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was a little bit underwhelmed at how
much cannabis was there considering
[SPEAKER_02]: there's, I would have thought there would
have been a much wider selection and a
[SPEAKER_02]: higher, basically a better grade of
cannabis, just to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know that you're quite selective
with what you smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if someone like, you know,
whether it's they've grown it or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got some stuff not grown by you,
but it's some stuff from your stable,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak, you know, it's one of your
guys creations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that kind of make you more open to
trying it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's still just like, it just has to be
growing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, I'll look, if we're in a situation
and somebody passes me a joint and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: lit, I'm going to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, dude, I'm, I'm a stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, I'm being honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to at least give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, if it makes my throat burn
and it makes me choke, I'm less likely to
[SPEAKER_02]: take it back and hit it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm that diva.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I will, I will bypass it,
but I'm always going to at least give it a
[SPEAKER_02]: try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, unless I'm sick, of course,
if I'm sick, I'm probably just altogether
[SPEAKER_02]: pass, but no, I'm not like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to, if somebody tells me it's
good, I'm always going to give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: People, people send us stuff and give us
stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when we first really got into this,
one of the reasons why we ended up
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding, uh, cannabis seeds in the first
place was, I can't tell you, we had what
[SPEAKER_02]: we felt like we had a few really solid
keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, at the time, I think we had
Urkel lavender and SEDC were our main
[SPEAKER_02]: keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, every time somebody would come to
us and tell us, Oh, I got the best strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would start there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They give us some samples of some dry
product and we'd smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always disappointed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we were like, maybe it's just
needs to be grown proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we would go about it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You acquire a cut or whatever seeds,
however, grow it out, finish it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it just wasn't, uh, no, it just
wasn't, wasn't good enough to be
[SPEAKER_02]: considered a keeper, like in our stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is another reason as to why we do
keep, um, I mean, we have, we have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong, but that's why you do
see us work with a very limited selection
[SPEAKER_02]: because we have like a set standard that
we go by.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it can't stay, I mean, if we can't
hang onto it, if it doesn't stay in there
[SPEAKER_02]: for at least four years, we're probably
not even going to bother with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and so what do you think is
kind of your favorite aspect of breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I honestly, I honestly enjoy just the
selection process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, cannabis it's, it's crazy because you
never really, you never really know what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of just have to pop the beans and
start looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you put these two parents together and
you might find like less variety amongst
[SPEAKER_02]: these beans while you put these other two
parents together and you might have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of variety, but the only way to know what
you're going to get is to just grow them
[SPEAKER_02]: out and look.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like one of my favorite parts
is, um, pop in the beans and then they're
[SPEAKER_02]: really not that fun until they get to a
certain size for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once they hit a certain age and then
they start to mature and sexing and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatnot, that's when they really become
fun because they start to at least show
[SPEAKER_02]: you something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I personally too, um, as far as like
selection and keepers and deciding,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to decide on necessarily a
seedling.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would prefer to make my decision on,
um, a taken cut that we've grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple times to give it a fair
representation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, cause they always grow different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, as a cut always grows different than a
seedling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of one of those things I
like to do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that because I remember
again, looping back to the Bob Hemphill
[SPEAKER_00]: chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he referenced that because we were
talking about how, you know, like over
[SPEAKER_00]: long periods of time cuts to grades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was saying, yeah, like how many
times have you seen like a plant perform
[SPEAKER_00]: well on the first time and then it's just
shit after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually thought about it over,
you know, the period afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, actually I've seen
that once or twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, and I, I guess I didn't
really understand why it was happening at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, but I just figured like,
maybe I grew it well the first time and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just whatever afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also interesting how there's the
opposite to be said as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like how there's, there's,
I've got more examples that come to mind
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff that gets better, you know,
like the older the clone is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a pretty widely held
consensus that the flowering time drops a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, you know, once the clone gets like,
you know, maybe a year or so old,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it, you know, over the course of that
time, it drops a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you feel that's the case?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it does, it changed, it changed by
taking the cut and flowering out cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do have a more true example of what
you're going to get, especially you have
[SPEAKER_02]: to look at it from the perspective of if
you're flowering out your seedling and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're trying to make all your decisions
based on what that seedling does,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not going to have very good
representation because the cut always,
[SPEAKER_02]: it always behaves different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more true to what you're going to get
if you continue to continue to grow that
[SPEAKER_02]: cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're going to grow a cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just think you get a better
representation by flowering your cuts than
[SPEAKER_02]: you do making a judgment call based off of
your seedling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the cuts do, I do find that they,
what they call it a little bit of a loss
[SPEAKER_02]: in hybrid vigor is what they, what they
would attribute it to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not all of them are that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do find, um, the cuts grow much more
consistently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as structure, I, I much more
prefer a cut because seedlings tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow kind of crazy in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think there's a bit of weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think you do suffer a bit of weight
loss, but you can make that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was saying earlier, by just,
um, like I said, I like to have a more
[SPEAKER_02]: mature plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to flower a more mature plant,
an older plant, one that's been kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: shaped and you know, one that's basically
been influenced by me for a set amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does the growing trend within the
California seed to the, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Californian scene to grow from seed
affect your breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make you guys want to try to,
you know, get something that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous out the gate or do you still
think it's, it's rather a small trend,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to sound like an asshole,
but we don't, we don't, we're not aiming
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything that we do, we're not,
we're not basing it on what you would say
[SPEAKER_02]: the market is asking for or what the
general public is asking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not, we don't do that because
there's plenty of people out there doing
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what we're trying to do was more,
um, we got started for ourselves really
[SPEAKER_02]: just looking to make a real solid
different forms of medications that can
[SPEAKER_02]: target different things about your
illnesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some that are better for daytime,
some that are better for nighttime,
[SPEAKER_02]: but something that you always have to go
to, that's always going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, the basis behind why we do it
is very different from why most people are
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding, um, cannabis seeds in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we're not really looking to just
please like the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I think that's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, our priorities, I guess, are a little
bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that's what it is, but our main
goal is always just basically really good,
[SPEAKER_02]: solid medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, something that you can go back to
hopefully year after year, but we'll still
[SPEAKER_02]: offer you that solid medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hope it has, but also stability
because you can read all the flavor you
[SPEAKER_02]: want, but you got to have some kind of
stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're hoping for.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping to kind of just have an
across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome strains for people to have access
to and hopefully not too expensive because
[SPEAKER_02]: you want everyone to have access to them
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're aiming for stability,
good solid meds and something that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: turn to year after year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's our goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings up a good question
submitted by another one of our Patreon
[SPEAKER_00]: fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, I'd love to know what,
uh, what strains these breeders can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it really depends on what your,
obviously it would be symptoms that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to target.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for me, I would say like, if I'm going
to, if I'm going to grab any strain that
[SPEAKER_02]: we have in our, in our arsenal to
basically smoke, to just overall take care
[SPEAKER_02]: of any issue I may have.
[SPEAKER_02]: For what we have, I would aim,
I would go for the lavender every single
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the reason I say that is because
that particular strain just gives you,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, just an overall calming effect
throughout your entire body head to toe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just does something to like your
stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just soothes it makes everything calm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the ability to target migraine
headaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just overall a solid strain for
your entire body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're not really like, sure what
you're aiming for, if you're just trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to touch on different, um, symptoms that
you may have for a range of ailments,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say lavender, but you know,
your reasons might be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want something just to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like you might want to take a couple
of hits and lay down and be able to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: sleep easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would, you know, every, and everyone
is different too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a tolerance thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, our Clementine it, um, if I haven't
been smoking a whole lot, and I smoked
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that one can actually make me quite
paranoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like not like really paranoid,
uh, and makes me stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just really, uh, I can't think,
I can't focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just makes me a mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not a good one for me if I'm
like feeling a little paranoid,
[SPEAKER_02]: but everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I like to say that every strain we
have offers some kind of medicinal value
[SPEAKER_02]: to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise we wouldn't even have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of brings me to, I mean,
not, not the best segue, but I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to run with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, in terms of your guys offerings,
are you going to have a really wild sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: offering ever?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would you even start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what type of genetics would you think
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, do you have anything in
the, in the, you know, the treasure chest,
[SPEAKER_00]: which might be able to fill that category
or you'd have to find that first?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we actually, we do, we have so many
beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we have so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll probably sit there forever and never
get touched would be my guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we have a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of stuff that we've even
created that have never even seen the
[SPEAKER_02]: light of day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we've got stuff like that,
but we also have a, um, a pretty wide
[SPEAKER_02]: collection of beans that, you know,
we back in the day were collecting,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, kind of a touch on something
that you brought up about limiting
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself or bringing things in from the
outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that kind of actually plays a role in
why we do stay within a lot of our own
[SPEAKER_02]: lines because we did, there was a point in
time early on where we were, we were
[SPEAKER_02]: searching beans all the time and that was
the worst feeling ever is when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going in there to check your plants that
you need to be able to rely on and they
[SPEAKER_02]: are, you know, if they're freaking out
because you, um, popped genes that are
[SPEAKER_02]: just not stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, that's what that's kind of where
we came to the conclusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to start creating our own,
um, genetics because it was becoming
[SPEAKER_02]: costly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're popping beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're thinking you're getting one thing
and you end up getting something I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually it just the risk of
pollinating other stuff in your room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you have a hermy or a freak.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just totally was off putting and we,
we decided that's when we would just start
[SPEAKER_02]: playing within our own lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've slowly expanded on top of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, we do, we bring things in
and there's things that we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't openly talk about, uh,
we learn that the hard way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but now we've got stuff to play with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we even are Clementine that
one in particular we have, we've got F
[SPEAKER_02]: twos, F threes and F fours just sitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we've dug through the F twos F and F
threes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the F fours have been completely
untouched.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have some of those to play around
with if we wanted to, but we also have
[SPEAKER_02]: some, some blueberry lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's other things we just,
it's just all a matter of time and what
[SPEAKER_02]: project you actually want to work on at
the time and what you have the time and
[SPEAKER_02]: space for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, if we just touch back on that
evil queen I mentioned before,
[SPEAKER_00]: it had some chem genetics in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem is obviously a pretty focal point of
this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pops up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you guys ever want to try to get it
and use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like have you tried what you think was
real chem and did you find it medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: for example?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, you know, we actually,
that, that, the one that you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about, it was, uh, I want to say it was
the chem, chem by, chem by Cindy 99,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we actually had that particular,
that female, that keeper female we had,
[SPEAKER_02]: we kept it for I want to say five or six
years at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and don't get me wrong, it visually
speaking, it was a keeper in so many
[SPEAKER_02]: people's gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it, like, it was really,
it was, uh, really good for taking
[SPEAKER_02]: pictures of, it was beautiful and it had
so many resins.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one thing that we both felt like
it just kind of lacked for us was the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we also too, we just couldn't,
we, we, we found we weren't able to
[SPEAKER_02]: incorporate it with anything that would,
um, bring out that flavor, but also offer
[SPEAKER_02]: that stability that we were looking for,
which is why we discontinued that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular, um, that, that keeper female
that we were working with at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, from that particular line,
um, we were gifted, um, beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we still have beans from that
particular strain, the, the chem dog by
[SPEAKER_02]: Cindy 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we ever wanted to revisit,
we have, we do have some things to work
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but like I said, it's just really,
if it's not something I want to work or if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not something mad wants to work,
it's just going to sit there for a while
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not going to get touched.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the deep Crippler is, you know,
a line I don't think many people have
[SPEAKER_00]: heard about.
[SPEAKER_00]: How come you guys haven't, you know,
put it out there as much as the other
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you plan to work it further
forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, we actually have talked
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, everybody does everybody who has had
contact with that particular strain really
[SPEAKER_02]: did like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it never, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, I didn't really have,
um, a particular love for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it just wasn't one that I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, people love the SCDC, which would be
the mother that we used at the time to
[SPEAKER_02]: create those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, other than being super like
beautiful and pictures and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, just a mass resin producer,
like I don't, I don't love her.
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep her because mad loves her.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's not really my particular passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do you know who?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the SCDC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'll leave that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ask mad about that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a debatable.
[SPEAKER_02]: The SCDC is a debatable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe we are the only ones that
hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a wink, wink.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I, I'm, no, I'm pretty sure seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, have you seen anybody else that
has it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I, I initially thought that you guys
made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let, I'll let mad discuss that one
with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That plant isn't, uh, I just don't love
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of his babies, not mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who are some breeders out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: He would love to collaborate with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Oh God, why would you ask me that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the question.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question that I would ask you is what
breeders would love to collaborate with
[SPEAKER_02]: us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess firstly, you'd want to,
the devil's in the details, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to assume that they're
going to bring one parent to the table and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll bring the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a feeling I know what parent they
would like us to bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I, I, if I were you, I would push
to bring the male jazz it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who are you suggesting for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, it depends what,
if you just, it's all about what you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, if I had to think like,
I want you guys to do something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd just pick someone really different
just so that no matter what they picked,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would result in something really
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well like something that's really,
well regarded and super sativa and just
[SPEAKER_00]: see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a sucker for sativas, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know how to answer that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess the other way I would think
about it is who is, is there a strain out
[SPEAKER_00]: there where you look at it and you're
like, man, I just love to cross the T-dub
[SPEAKER_00]: to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, if it's yes, then you know,
who was the breeder of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, gosh, I wish that was one you
would have maybe sent me in advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know there are some out there off
the top of my head though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know there's a couple of strains out
there cause I've specifically talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: them, but I just can't think off the top
of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, if we were to work with
somebody, um, the, the first and foremost
[SPEAKER_02]: important thing we would want to work with
somebody obviously that has a good
[SPEAKER_02]: reputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and we're always looking for honesty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, again, I think that's something that
it's a bit of a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I think we have, uh, there's a problem
in the industry of not calling things what
[SPEAKER_02]: they actually are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish people would just call things
what they actually are.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you want to take the lead?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, just serve a hot one up for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, I think there's probably a
lot less strains out there in existence
[SPEAKER_02]: than we think.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a lot of names.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like, you've got one strain and it
actually has like seven names.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everybody thinks it's seven
different strains, but in reality it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really just one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish there was a lot less of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, as far as working with
anybody collaborating, I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically and not anybody in
particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're just so busy doing our own
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, plants really, believe it or not,
are not our first priority.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our first priority always is our,
our child.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, she's 17 now, so hopefully soon
she'll be going off to college.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that's the case, we'll have a lot more
time for others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other things, but as of right now,
plants kind of come secondary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good, good life decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question submitted by another
one of our fans is what to you is the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between a breeder and a pollen
chucker?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably the definition would be my
guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I guess it depends who you actually
took.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, seriously, I guess it really depends
on who you talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm giving like my opinion based on
what I think the, like the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: standard would be, I would say a breeder
is somebody who, um, has a more solid,
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledgeable understanding for the
strains that they're working, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: and have some of maybe their own stuff,
um, aren't just crossing other people's
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, this going and getting this
female from this breeder and this male
[SPEAKER_02]: from this breeder and throwing them
together, I would think that's more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen chucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it depends who you talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what, breeding's breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pollinating a plant and creating
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone technically can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's common sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty, it's a pretty basic thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone can do it, but doesn't mean anyone
can do it well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I do, I think it's just,
um, I think it's more of a, probably the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the standards behind the person doing
the work, because I think that an actual,
[SPEAKER_02]: a true breeder, I think they probably
really do care more about what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing and have a solid love for what
they're doing as we're a pollen chucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion is probably doing it for the
cash and just to pump out strains to make
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be how I would view it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what do you think of the various
land races?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mean, obviously Clementine comes
from Afghani origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's something that's got a
soft spot for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you, you know, had to pick a land
race that, you know, you are more fond of,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be the more favourites for
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say obviously I love our,
I love our Clementine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an awesome Afghani plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high from her is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, again, for me, I put it in front of
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm either, I either love it or I don't,
you know, um, I think for me to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: say that I like a particular strain or I
have like a really solid love for
[SPEAKER_02]: something I do, I would have to sample it
and I'd have to, I'd have to be able to,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, at least try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, that's the only way I can really give
an opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, as far as ours, I just love that
the Clementine that we have, that's why
[SPEAKER_02]: we, you know, we continue to work it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, why we even talk about
maybe digging even deeper into those F4s
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have might be something
interesting to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, would you ever consider
trying it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not necessarily a pure Clementine
line, but just trying to maybe create a
[SPEAKER_00]: more indica type of tangy thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's the thing which I found
unique is that a lot of the more orangey
[SPEAKER_00]: strains are not Afghani by nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, I think it would be really
interesting to have like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like an offering that's basically like,
you know, a very indica, very medicinal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you know, trying to gun to be a
very orangey type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that interests you or
you think the fad's over?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I honestly think that pot strain
as far as like the fads of flavors and
[SPEAKER_02]: coming and going, I think it's going to be
just like, um, probably just like music
[SPEAKER_02]: and clothing, you know, from the eighties
to the nineties, we're going to recycle
[SPEAKER_02]: through all the ugly shit all over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like we'll like something now
and then give it about 10 years and we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: bring it back and everybody will act like
it's new again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's just the nature of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know, like I do, don't get me
wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like good flavors in my cannabis,
but there has to be a balance to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it can't just be good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to, it's got to do more than
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to do more than offer a good
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to, got to get, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to get me high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this one's a little left of field,
but I really want to know the answer to
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you guys ever consider doing Urkel
or Lavender S ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, everybody asks that and everybody
says, why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is, is why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he, I want to, I want to really play
devil's advocate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone else came out and they started
doing it and their cuts were real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you knew it was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that affect your decision at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, actually doesn't, I believe CSI,
doesn't he, hasn't he asked one of his
[SPEAKER_02]: Urkel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, one step ahead of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He definitely, yeah, he definitely does do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Mendo purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I mean, I think there's some people
out there who are looking for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but to me it raises the next question is,
do you think it's possible to find
[SPEAKER_00]: something as good or better than the
mother in an S one?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, is that an influencing factor
in your decision not to do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, first I would say there's a
reason why we don't, we don't do the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: S one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't believe in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's your, I know on some levels
you say part of like the advancement and
[SPEAKER_02]: society is technology and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're always manipulating things,
you know, so people die later on in life
[SPEAKER_02]: and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as messing with genetics,
I'm mad and I aren't fans of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I would say as far as S wanting
the lavender or the Urkel, if it was that
[SPEAKER_02]: simple, let's just S one it, you'll find
something so much better than why hasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: it been done and why isn't it talked about
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it were that simple, why do
breeders that have also supposedly the
[SPEAKER_02]: Urkel cut ask mad for it regularly?
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the kinds of questions that I
ask myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so no S ones won't, I don't ever see
them happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I don't think it's as simple as
just S one it and you'll find something
[SPEAKER_02]: better because if that were the case,
it would have been done already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually, if the opposite mindset
of the, I, I've yet to see a single S one,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is as good as the parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, and I let, you know, some people ask
too, um, do you, do you ever find where,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the strains that you've created come
out better than the, like the keeper
[SPEAKER_02]: mother?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yes, otherwise we wouldn't
bother, uh, create, you know, otherwise we
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't bother.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a different, obviously it's
better, but it's a different better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different than the mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I do think there's, if it did come
out, if it was something as good or better
[SPEAKER_02]: than people would do it all the time and
they would do it with everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there would be no need for
regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to say no to the S one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it were that simple to find something
so much better and it were that that much
[SPEAKER_02]: easier, I would think it would have
already been done by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does that extend to just feminize in
general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like would you do femme crosses or just
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we, we, uh, you know, like I said,
I've learned from mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So based off of his, um, like I said,
he's, he's got a really, he's got a mad
[SPEAKER_02]: brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, um, the amount of knowledge he has
taken in when it comes to cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like nothing I've ever seen
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, he has a solid belief on why he
doesn't believe in it, why he does like
[SPEAKER_02]: regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's made his argument with me and I
can, I can, I can agree with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, I can look at it too,
even with like people and genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I really wouldn't want to do that
with my kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, kind of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask you a question that I
asked mad in the initial interview I did
[SPEAKER_00]: with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about granddaddy purple
seeing as it's kind of like the watered
[SPEAKER_00]: down Urkel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I, I guess I don't really
have much of an opinion either.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I was actually smoking some,
some concentrates of the granddaddy
[SPEAKER_02]: purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we went to that endo expo and mad
packed my vape pen, but he didn't pack
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I only had the bottom half,
the battery portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, how am I supposed to smoke
when you only packed half of my shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we got there, the, one of the
seeds here now guys, um, Ben was nice
[SPEAKER_02]: enough to gift me one of the little
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was granddaddy purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to smoke that and it was pretty
all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, not to me, wasn't as,
wasn't nothing like Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any similarity or you're
skeptical on the link?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like a, like a very watered down,
mild version maybe, but it's definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: not, it's not the same as Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, actually has to me, it had more
of, um, I don't know, maybe more of like a
[SPEAKER_02]: perfumey type.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of spin to it that made it more
different than the, than the Urkel was for
[SPEAKER_02]: me, but it definitely, it didn't,
the one thing I can say is for it being
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates, it didn't even get me high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just gave me like a really like mild
buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was kind of a disappointment,
but it was just nice to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a concern you have in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I've heard is, is that
there's just like an exponential growth in
[SPEAKER_00]: both the demand and the supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of these cartridge types of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard that that's where a lot of
the shady back, back counter stuff can
[SPEAKER_00]: happen in terms of like material getting
processed that like probably wouldn't pass
[SPEAKER_00]: or stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you concerned about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it's all a bit of like
rumor wives tale type stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think anytime that you have rumors,
you got to take into consideration things
[SPEAKER_02]: come from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's likely some truth to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I think anytime you're doing
business with people, you just need to do
[SPEAKER_02]: your research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, you should know what you're
getting into at least as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like you mean as far as, uh,
concentrates as far as testing and being
[SPEAKER_02]: clean, like free of bugs and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've heard is that like, there's a
lot of bud, which, you know, maybe does
[SPEAKER_00]: have an issue, but it just gets turned
into concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then by the time it gets down to like
the type of thing, which would end up in a
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridge, it's so highly processed that
you would just have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been like, there's like pesticides
and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm sure there's definite truth to
that because that has to have come from
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, I would assume there's truth to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, like I, like I was saying,
I would just assume, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, whoever you do business with,
if you have somebody, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: creating those for you or making,
putting your, uh, making it into
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates, you should, you should
probably know where you're getting your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your medicine from, at least have an idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, once, which is also one of the reasons
why Mad and I like to, um, smoke our own.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think there's a certain negative
element in the way that there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: separation from the plant in that you can
just get this cartridge and it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: removed from the flower that it leads to
this situation where you get these crazy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, possibly adulterants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if everyone was just still
sticking with flour, arguably it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal and you're more likely to spot
any, you know, visual issues, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually do, I have even noticed,
um, uh, you know, concentrates,
[SPEAKER_02]: they say concentrates are stronger,
but I've even noticed sometimes,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, um, a difference from say,
if you were to take this Urkel flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it, and then compare it to the same
concentrates made from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed there is like a difference in
the way my body like reacts to that,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if it's the same strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do feel like, um, I feel like I do have
a more true feeling of a stone when I
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke actual flour versus concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get, I feel like it gives me a better,
um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have a better feel of that
particular strain if I smoke it in flour
[SPEAKER_02]: versus concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely agree with that one myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, I found a forum post many
years ago, I think it was 2011 or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, and it said that like it
reckons it had the genetics listed for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Tripoli Wicked and the Purple Jackie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys tried to keep that under
wraps?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not any, any, anything that you can
find, like any, any records of when we
[SPEAKER_02]: were online, it's should be fully
accessible to anybody that wants to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we've always been honest about what we
worked from when we originally first got,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the mail that we worked in those
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that was, it was a mail that was
gifted to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Mads told this story before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was, um, like all the names were
always left out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just made me wonder, like,
do you intentionally not want to reveal
[SPEAKER_00]: the lineage of certain things or?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, like on, on which one in particular,
which, which forum is this that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it, was it, who's post?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one on Roll It Up by a guy called
Elite Nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he says he's a friend of yours,
but you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know who you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what, what is it that he listed
specifically?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was never on Roll It Up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says Purple Jackie is Mendo cross a
Purple Urkel mail and, uh, Tripoli Wicked
[SPEAKER_00]: is Lavender cross a Purple Urkel mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there is actually like a bit of a
story to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back a bit further and I,
I do prefer Mad tell this story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's even actually covered this
when, when you and him did one of your
[SPEAKER_02]: interviews before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, oh my God, it's like such an extensive
story.
[SPEAKER_02]: The gentleman that we got our mail cut
from back then when we first worked it,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, there's like, um, he contacted us and
he says, I've got this cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are, he has a cut and, um,
these beans that he had and it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, this, the particular, he got them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were what labeled as Urkel Purple
Urkel beans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is many, many years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Madden him formed a relationship and
there's like a whole story from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe he's told it, but as far as
like dates and all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's something that you'd have to touch
on with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like I said, this goes back to
like the beginning when I really didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have so much involvement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and this was a deal between him and
this particular guy, but the reason it's
[SPEAKER_02]: listed that way is because, um,
they believed it was from the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lineage was from the Purple Urkel,
the mail that, that we were gifted back
[SPEAKER_02]: when we used it, which we did,
we ended up killing that mail,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was the one that was used to make
the original Purple Jackie beans and the
[SPEAKER_02]: original T Dub beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so if you dig back a bit further,
maybe 2003, 2006 or so somewhere around
[SPEAKER_02]: that area, um, it's another forum that we
were actually on.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a particular story in there and
it'll explain all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It explains, um, just in, in full detail,
um, where the cut itself came from that
[SPEAKER_02]: this mail we, we used in the project.
[SPEAKER_02]: The truth is, is it's just basically,
we had to label it as we were told it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: and all we know is where it came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: What people believe they were labeled as
at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was supposed to be from the same
lineage as Purple Urkel itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no secret behind the lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, nobody really knew what to call
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the time it was actually labeled
the triple email, like as in E E and E
[SPEAKER_02]: because back then too, I don't know if you
know or how familiar you are, but there
[SPEAKER_02]: were times when they were spelling Urkel
with an E.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that ring a bell to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, and, um, some of the research done
back on this, this cut that we also were
[SPEAKER_02]: gifted back when this project was
originally created, that's how they were
[SPEAKER_02]: labeled was as Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where the E came from because
the original spelling on those were
[SPEAKER_02]: spelled with an E.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look back further, you can find
some more research.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all there to be seen, but as far as
like the full details and the story and
[SPEAKER_02]: the names, that would all be best to come
from mad because my brain just doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: remember all of that stuff quite as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus I, like I said, I didn't jump in
until I had to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was much, much later when he got
so sick and, um, he ended up in the
[SPEAKER_02]: hospital and he just couldn't do all this
work by himself anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I believe he told you this story too,
when you guys did your, one of your
[SPEAKER_02]: interviews, like I almost positive he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, um, the, those details about
the, the Urkel and the lavender and where
[SPEAKER_00]: it all sat as the parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we didn't get those bits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see that's too where his, why he's
always had such a fascination too,
[SPEAKER_02]: for understanding the Urkel and the
lavender lineage because he's,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he, he's, he's positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's, he's sure he knows what it,
what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That created, like, he knows if you ask
him, he knows in his mind what created
[SPEAKER_02]: that lavender and what created that Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I just, he, he has an amazing
mind for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, back then that's what sparked his
interest because everybody was so
[SPEAKER_02]: insistent that all the purple strains back
then were identical and they just weren't,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he knew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's where all of that,
that interest came from was because of
[SPEAKER_02]: those projects he had started up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the thing that I've noticed about
the purple strains is to me, they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the most kind of most enjoyable
terpene profiles, you know, you referenced
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, there's like a perfuminess to
them almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your favorite terpene profile?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I feel like a brat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, with the lavender side of things,
you tend to have, um, I would say it is
[SPEAKER_02]: more floral.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes, um, my daughter will even say
it has like a, like it's reminds her of
[SPEAKER_02]: walking into Starbucks, the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so lavender has that smell,
which is really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does, um, it does roll over into
the flavor sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as to where Urkel, Urkel will
tend to have more of like a grape soda
[SPEAKER_02]: every once in a while too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll even pick up like a pink bubble gum
flavor in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but that's like, those are the bit of
a different flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in those purples and then in our,
uh, wicked Clementine and like some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: T-dub T-dubs that we've grown,
they are heavily citrus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's so, it's so, it's so
dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people will say it's orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some will say it's a lemon,
like pint, uh, like pink lemonade,
[SPEAKER_02]: like some will say it's more like
grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but those, those types of terpene
herbs actually start to bother me after a
[SPEAKER_02]: while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do lean more towards, um, that the
flavor that the Urkel and the lavender
[SPEAKER_02]: tend, tend to carry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do also like, um, the more old
school flavor that that Clementine kicks
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's just, it just reminds you of
like a real old school, but, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of maybe like, uh, I don't know,
just really, really soft, easy on the
[SPEAKER_02]: lungs, like a real real mild, maybe mild,
kind of like a hint of pine to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but almost sour at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mouthwatering.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually super stony that
Clementine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it does, if you, like, if I haven't
been smoking much of her, it just fucks me
[SPEAKER_02]: up, like makes me stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So final question that was submitted from
one of our Patreon fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, I would love you to ask Mrs.
Mad, what does she look for in a keeper
[SPEAKER_00]: and how does she approach a grow room in
general?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think what they mean by that is,
is it just purely about like effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you just smoke it and that's all,
or is there other considerations like
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, you know, ease of growing,
all those types of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how do you decide keepers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh God, everything, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take everything into effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like starting in veg, there's a couple
of things that I'm going to pay attention
[SPEAKER_02]: to first off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you have, um, height
restrictions, space restrictions of any
[SPEAKER_02]: type, you need to focus the strains that
you grow around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which is one of the things that I
love.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say, you know, our strains are
really nice about that because we are
[SPEAKER_02]: limited with height and space and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do try to focus a plant that can
produce you something super stony with the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor, but all the other things that you
grow around that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in a manageable space and doesn't
like top out at crazy heights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do try to touch on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I'm looking at stuff that grows
similar to a structure that I like and I
[SPEAKER_02]: do, I like a shorter squatty plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I like, uh, a growth structure that I
can, um, control rather easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't like a super finicky plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if, if, um, if she gets, if I give a,
if a female especially gets root bound and
[SPEAKER_02]: if it starts getting temperamental with
me, I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want it to be root bound and start
showing problems instantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like them to be super tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like them to be, um, I don't like
when they're temperamental because then if
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to like be away or there's going
to be any type of stressor, you know that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to be easily set off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to necessarily keep plants
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so structures big, uh, pest resistance
is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not like strains that, uh,
have like a tendency to have powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the worst, especially if you're,
um, limited on the space that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: working.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to have to deal with
powdery mildew and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we stay away from strains that,
um, have tendencies to pick up powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew or draw in certain bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, we also,
uh, plants that are really expressive in
[SPEAKER_02]: their turps tend to draw bugs,
nuisance bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you kind of have to balance
that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now as far as in flower, like,
oh, too, stem rubs are always nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people talk about that a lot,
but just any kind of smells that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: pick up from them might give you some,
um, signs on what, what a plant will give
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just the colors that they express,
how thick the stocks get.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pay attention to everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, again, like I said, I stress them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make them, um, ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to see how, how reactive they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can they crowd out, um, are they strong
enough to crowd out other plants when
[SPEAKER_02]: situations get tough?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when, when things get really
overgrown, can they dominate as to where
[SPEAKER_02]: another plant may get pushed out?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I look at stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but keepers again, like we're always
looking for, we do, I like to stay away
[SPEAKER_02]: from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,
[SPEAKER_02]: so, um, so yeah, that's something out of
what I typically would like, but I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: working with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still very comprehensive answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I would love to quickly ask,
where did terpenes and aesthetics rate for
[SPEAKER_00]: you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you bred something and
it's absolutely amazing smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's no terpenes, is that like a no
go for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where do all these things sit?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually really an easy,
that's really one of the easier questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, seriously looking for balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: All we're always looking for balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's got, it's got to offer you up
some, you know, very specific things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like I said, one, you want stability
first and foremost, stability is important
[SPEAKER_02]: to, if I can't stand the taste of it,
that's going to be a bit of a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't like it, if it's going to make
my throat hurt, if it burns my lungs,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are all problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know like, if it's, I know if it's
doing that on a consistent basis,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you without a doubt,
it's not what my husband is doing in
[SPEAKER_02]: flower because he babies his plants and
they always come out with the best
[SPEAKER_02]: available flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's something that's not just given
it up in the flavor department,
[SPEAKER_02]: it likely won't even be touched by us,
but it could have all the flavor in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't, uh, doesn't give you the
desired effect of, you know, getting you
[SPEAKER_02]: stoned, taking care of your stomach
issues, um, taking care of your aches and
[SPEAKER_02]: pains and your sore back or helping you
sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, there has to be balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But stability first and foremost,
um, and like again, it should be giving
[SPEAKER_02]: you something every bit as good as those
keeper mamas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's not giving you every bit as
good as those keeper mamas or better than
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just not worth your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the tail end at all now,
this is a question I love to ask people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I think in my head, it always
seems like it'll be a harder question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a question of what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could only do one for the rest of
your life, indoor or outdoor, which one
[SPEAKER_00]: would it be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, this is funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mad would tell you all day long.
[SPEAKER_02]: He would say outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not, I would say indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, maybe because I'm, I'm, I'm,
I'm not big on change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't like change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whenever I make changes nine times out of
10, I find myself very disappointed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: In life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that's why I say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, I'm, I'm just being honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, every time I make a change,
it rarely turns out better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not a fan of change because of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm the kind of person that if I find
something and it works for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, I will, I will make a change.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can give me evidence that shows me
if you do it like this and you can give me
[SPEAKER_02]: an example of how there will be solid
evidence to prove it will be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will, but you have to be able to present
me with solid evidence because I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: about to abandon everything I know and
everything I do great at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless there's a good reason to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just, that's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in regards to indoor, what is your
preferred type of life?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, now this is where there is no,
there's no, uh, there's no real compromise
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: No compromise.
[SPEAKER_02]: What mad says goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, for my veg, I, we've got just
basic two fives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, mad's pretty basic.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: He likes old school all the way,
but now he's, um, pretty dead set on the
[SPEAKER_02]: certain things that he uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now, um, when it comes to stuff like
that, I don't, I don't, um, I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: pretend to have input there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he's actually he's old school dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got, um, the, uh, what it,
why is this so hard for him?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has high pressure sodiums, but he's got
just, we have our old school ballasts in
[SPEAKER_02]: there, but they have never done us wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, hydro farm all the way, uh,
never had a problem not once.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the ones that we even have
have like just the best warranties on
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, he, like I said, he even is to a
certain extent like me, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you, um, in anything, that we do,
he's very much a perfectionist like I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't mess with anything if it's
working well for me, unless I find a
[SPEAKER_02]: reason that I need to change it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that case, I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he's the same way, but actually it's
funny that you bring that up because he
[SPEAKER_02]: was just telling me the other day,
um, cause we're going to be needing to put
[SPEAKER_02]: some plants into flowers soon,
but he is talking about wanting to go
[SPEAKER_02]: through a bunch of changes on,
um, lights and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking, oh, I'm so glad that's
not my, that's not, not in the,
[SPEAKER_02]: within the realm of the things that I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I don't want to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't, but that's one of the
things really nice about what him and I do
[SPEAKER_02]: together because it's such a shared
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: He really does do the things that I hate
or I don't, I don't like to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And trust me, there are some of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's some things that I just,
I'll be honest, that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love about this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will never know everything there is to
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always something to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is one of the coolest things
because you will never have all the
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge there is to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always learn something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really do enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, uh, we get to share in
everything that we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has such an extensive knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and he's been studying for so long
that he's, he does make a good majority.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of our decisions, unless like I said,
it's one of those things that falls within
[SPEAKER_02]: my, um, you know, things that I like to
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I am, I am a control freak.
[SPEAKER_02]: He will tell you I'm almost borderline
psycho when it comes to the things I like
[SPEAKER_02]: to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's a general grow tip you've got
for the viewers, just to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: get things, you know, just perky a little
better, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the things people don't
realize, I think they forget it is
[SPEAKER_02]: basically a weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just keep in mind, uh, they,
they're real basic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow, it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they don't require a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just really love and care.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can really just watch them and they'll
tell you everything that they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, reading is always good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one of the things that I actually
personally feel like I have learned myself
[SPEAKER_02]: that has been extremely helpful for me is
if I ever have a problem, the one thing I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't do, I know everybody runs to the
computer.
[SPEAKER_02]: First thing, um, I do not go on pot
forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: I refuse to find information there because
most of it, a lot of it is crazy for
[SPEAKER_02]: starters, but a lot of it will send you to
doing things to your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy, dangerous, bad for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sometimes we'll kill them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but also we'll, we'll, we'll straight
up make you panic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I, what I try to do is I try to do
a lot of my research, uh, just basically
[SPEAKER_02]: apply common sense knowledge to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I do a lot of agricultural site
research and we're lucky to have some
[SPEAKER_02]: friends in, um, like agricultural
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can ask them questions and they can
kind of give you some guidance on which
[SPEAKER_02]: way to go with certain products or,
you know, pest questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, I would say don't get all
your information from pot forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be really dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really bad for your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and just don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it basic and then read books.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just run and ask somebody that you
think can answer the question for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go get the knowledge yourself,
read as many books as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some really good ones out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Matt has probably about 20 of them
in his possession over the years he's been
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, I think a lot of people too
with, um, pot forums, plants, they just
[SPEAKER_02]: overdo it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they think more is better and it's
not, it's just a basic plant and it grows
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killing it with kindness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this brings us to our last little quick
fire questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one, what is your favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can only pick one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like today my favorite strain would be
lavender for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been, we've had it in our,
in our collection for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I said, it's one, no matter how
crappy I feel, I know that I can,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go to lavender and get some type of
relief.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got to say her lavender all the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is the strain that's just
least left an impact on you slash just
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't impress you at all personally?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this feels like an awful question to
answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say like left awful
impressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say that there's a lot of strains out
there with a lot of hype to them just
[SPEAKER_02]: based off of names, which kind of drives
me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's actually the next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so we'll just, we'll combine them
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the worst strain to ever gain
traction with the masses?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I think depending on what strain is the
current cut of the month club would be the
[SPEAKER_02]: one that falls in that category for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably as of lately, I'd say some
dumb ass cookies or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just hate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why, but I really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, again, like you were asking earlier,
do you feel like this is why I don't feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like I'm limiting myself?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm setting standards by doing
that because then we're not running out
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the exact same thing that everybody
else is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's face it, everybody else is doing
that same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, no cookies, all of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is there?
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got, what, what was, you had that
nine, nine pound hammer for a while there,
[SPEAKER_02]: which that's been a while a ways away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God there was, um, you have like,
of course like the OG KB like all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: little ones that pop up with all these
crazy followings.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do, I'm, I'm not saying that the
strain itself sucks because I'm not saying
[SPEAKER_02]: that I'm just like, I think the hype
behind it is overplayed and overblown is
[SPEAKER_02]: more how I would look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could only smoke one land race
variety for the rest of your life,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's it going to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you pick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever that land race tie boat he gave
me was.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like Pearl tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he said it was low land tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why, why was this your pick?
[SPEAKER_00]: God is so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: What stood out?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about it stood out to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like, um, it's like what you
wish super silver haze was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like everyone's happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any strains that you can think of
that, um, are like really, really good,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just don't get any attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Magoo straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love blue Magoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, um, it's the, it's, it's made by an
unknown grower from Oregon and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: cross of blueberry and Williams one to F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so pretty solid genetics in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of like, it's kind of
perfumey in the same way that like Urkel
[SPEAKER_00]: is, but more of like a blueberry and roses
type of thing, as opposed to like a real,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like musky perfume in the way
that Urkel is, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that the blueberry flavors can get
kind of overwhelming at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Though you like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually, yeah, we played with some
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we may, that might be something we
might revisit at some point, but when we
[SPEAKER_02]: did, we played around with the blueberry
and the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: We even have some blueberry, the Northern
lights by blueberry somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but when we played with that Urkel by
blueberry, everything, it just smelled
[SPEAKER_02]: like a giant blueberry muffin in
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like blueberry muffins all day
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just got really tired of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a significant demand for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we should, maybe we should
definitely consider looking back into
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I could see maybe the Northern
lights by blueberry being fun to play
[SPEAKER_02]: around with, you know, that might be
something worth looking into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, it's a cross that's been
done by so many different breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I think a lot of people
probably, like, for example, me,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I hit Northern lights, blueberry,
I'm like, oh yeah, like one of the million
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern lights, blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's just obviously like a knee
jerk reaction due to how many just rip off
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that are offering that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whereas I think the Urkel blueberry
would be really, really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as I know, no one offers that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we have those too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've, we, we grew actually a bunch of
them out and it was just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were both so sick of it when we were
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like that smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything was just like a blueberry
muffin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just really, really got sick of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we were sick of it,
but I don't think anybody else was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the T-dub, the T-dub lines are
actually like that too, because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: very, that citrus, the citrus scents and
tones that they pick up are so heavy and
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's so overwhelming for your
palette at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lucky last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could go back in time to any place,
collect any seeds, which ones would you
[SPEAKER_00]: get?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you go and grab the bundle of,
uh, you know, cause who knows how many
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds they were in the original Urkel or
Lavender batch, but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: go sweep them up or what are you thinking?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I would.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'd go, I don't, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I, I, I think I'm ready to look,
look at something a little bit different
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would, I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's so much put behind,
um, everybody wanting certain strains and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I'm as obsessed as others
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these kinds of questions, I think other
people think about them quite regularly
[SPEAKER_02]: and these aren't things that really have
ever crossed my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's just because,
um, I've never really been into that
[SPEAKER_02]: whole, um, the strain craze, uh,
like the research and who had what and
[SPEAKER_02]: what stories this, I've just never really
been that into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be hard for me to say if I
haven't actually smoked this particular
[SPEAKER_02]: strain, I can't see myself really wanting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'd have to have some sort of
interest in it to say I would want those
[SPEAKER_02]: beans to play around with and off the top
of my head, nothing that I could
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everything that we currently have
that I'd want to play around with,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have access to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I did say though, I definitely
want to get some awesome CBD strain in
[SPEAKER_02]: our, in our collection to work through,
but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as that question, that one's
tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's make that CBD thing happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know I really, I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that just might bring us about
to the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have any comments or shout outs
you'd like to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, actually, um, I'm curious too
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it that you're currently working
with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my current project I'm doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what strains are you currently
working with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing, I'm finishing off the cube of
the Phantom Cracker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty sure I sent you the BX ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm currently finishing the BX twos and
then I'll probably do the BX threes as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, depending on how the BX twos turn
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if they're, if they're good enough,
I'll just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I, I, I like the idea of
finishing the project off where it should
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's just, you know, in the sense
that, you know, statistic, I like how,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at a certain point you can
statistically calculate, it should have a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of the parent within it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, the cube seems like the good
end point, but who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I've got some other stuff off in
the back that I'm toying with,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not a hundred percent sure yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to maybe see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many possibilities when you
start putting strains together,
[SPEAKER_02]: you never really know when you're going to
be done looking through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just so many possibilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I need to take a page out of
your book in regards to the, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: the organization and the notes,
cause I got a lot of good seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some of those little baggies,
the, uh, the, the writing on them starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to fade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I actually, I, I sit down about once a
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pull our stock of seeds like that,
that all have different types of packaging
[SPEAKER_02]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I sit down and I will relabel and make
sure, because you notice after handling
[SPEAKER_02]: and whatnot, some of them will rub off or,
you know, you just don't want to lose what
[SPEAKER_02]: your seeds are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But too, like, like I was saying,
we are, uh, you know, I hear these
[SPEAKER_02]: interviews and people can quote,
you know, months and years, and I can't,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to tell you right now,
if you wanted to know these things,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to go into the other room and
dig out, uh, we have stacks of notebooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I actually, I started out buying mad
calendars with the big, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the desk calendar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had the big scoreboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he started out using those,
but then he would fill up the entire note
[SPEAKER_02]: section and he needed more space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started buying notebooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we do is each day that you do
something, you write in the, you write
[SPEAKER_02]: your month, your day and the year,
and you even write the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if it's Saturday, you write down
Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, but you know, you can go
back in reference each time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we list, uh, like if you're,
if you're feeding or you're giving them
[SPEAKER_02]: something, you write down what you're
giving them.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much, um, we get real specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing any type of treatments of
any kind, you write it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We write everything down and then we keep
these stacks and stacks and notebooks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gives you, um, believe it or not,
you don't use the majority of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's really neat to look back through
because you can find that you have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of knowledge there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you completely forgot you had,
and it tells you a lot about the strains
[SPEAKER_02]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do, we're note keepers all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to any shout outs or you want to
wrap it up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would definitely like to thank you
for, um, for interviewing me today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been fun talking to you and thank you
to my husband and my daughter.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I wouldn't, I wouldn't,
I'm nothing without those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seriously, I give all my credit to my
husband because I've learned everything
[SPEAKER_02]: from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you know, too, all of our,
our amazing growers and supporters,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, all of the people that have grown our
genetics are always so nice and kind to
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course we're nothing without them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we appreciate all the support that
they've given to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, super special shout out to everybody
in Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was telling you, um, everyone in
Australia is always so positive and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're such amazing people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great growers too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might add, um, but one of the things I
think everybody could learn from,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, just like online presence of the
people in Australia, everybody is so kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have never ever been trolled by somebody
out of Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think that I just want to make
that known.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I just would like to thank dirt
MDNC crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those guys are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, their products are amazing and
everybody should check them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two, like I said, our homie bang
mingo, um, he keeps me in my concentrates
[SPEAKER_02]: when I'm out of anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's too, is likely to be,
um, a future business partner of,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, me and mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's nice things coming to in our
future, hopefully too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, like I said, we've got some local
friends, the genocide project.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're out of Modesto.
[SPEAKER_02]: They operate both the medicinal and an
adult use store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they're called the genocide project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I go to them too, for, um,
concentrates when I need, um, and they
[SPEAKER_02]: also actually do quite a nice selection
process through our genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also, uh, sell, sell flowers of,
um, mad farmer genetics out of their shop
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, like I said, I appreciate my
husband.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's taught me a lot and he's just awesome
and wouldn't be in this industry without
[SPEAKER_02]: him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really do appreciate you taking the
time to talk to me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
