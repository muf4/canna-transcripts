[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and welcome to the 2019 Breeder
Awards for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're joined by your boy Hebdez as always
here to run down the 2019 awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have with me Mr. James Bean himself to
discuss why certain breeders, certain
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and certain trends have taken the
scene by storm in the past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out as always to Seeds here now,
your number one seed bank in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big, big shout out to our friends in
the Patreon gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, helping make the show happen,
lifeblood of the show, getting early
[SPEAKER_00]: access to episodes, unreleased contents,

[SPEAKER_00]: 2, Mean Gene and Mr. Bob Hemphill Part 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how to get that here to Google
Patreon the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big shout out to Top Shelf Seed
Bank, Dragonfly Earth Medicine and Organic
[SPEAKER_00]: Gardening Solutions, our homies helping to
spread the love and make the show happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you ready for the awards for the
past year?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hello and welcome to the inaugural 2019
Podcast Cannabis Awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: These awards have been decided largely
based on the activities and occurrences
[SPEAKER_00]: over the November 2018 to November 2019
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what this means is that anything
gets released at, say, Emerald Cup or at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the year, that'll go into next
year's running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're largely looking back,
seeing what's come out over the last
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the awards categories for this year are
the following Breeder of the Year,
[SPEAKER_00]: Most Impactful Seed Drop of the Year,
Hall of Fame Strain, Hottest Newcomer
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeder to the Scene, Most Anticipated
Seed Drop of 2020, Most Commercially
[SPEAKER_00]: Popular Strain and Clone of the Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the most part, these awards were
decided by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I decided to take into account
the opinions of several other notable
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm lucky enough to be joined here
today by the one and only James Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very good, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final component for these awards
was decided by some polls I put up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some fans got some input.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to try to provide some
logic and kind of some rationale behind
[SPEAKER_00]: each of the decisions and just kind of
accompany the decision as to why we chose
[SPEAKER_00]: them or what we think is good about each
pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a personal note, a lot of these
picks are not necessarily my personal
[SPEAKER_00]: winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the clarity in the rationale
will hopefully back up why we're picking
[SPEAKER_00]: these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not just a case of, oh,
that's my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we pick them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So jumping into it, the first award we're
going to discuss is the Most Commercially
[SPEAKER_00]: Popular Strain of the Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without any further ado, the winner for
this was Gelato and all of the extensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think, Mr. Bean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I nailed it on the head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I called it last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I knew everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw the most crosses, the most most
breeders using it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's it's it's it's become on
sort of, I don't know, cool or uncool how
[SPEAKER_04]: it is, but it's sort of common these days
for a new clone to hit the scene and then
[SPEAKER_04]: just everybody get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the breeders work with it because
it's a clone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's they're all essentially working with
the same branch of a branch of a branch.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just each have a different branch.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then each breeder hits it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And definitely Gelato was the girl that
got past her on the most this year,
[SPEAKER_04]: so to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: No questions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at the Emerald Cut, we saw
Ridgeline win with their runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, for this discussion,
I consider runs, white runs, grunts,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all of those derivatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Gelato, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in essence, we saw it win the Emerald
Cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw it was an entry in basically every
high times, every competition of all
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties you saw this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think most notably is we we saw that
it pretty much wiped the hype market out
[SPEAKER_00]: for any other strain that didn't have
Gelato or cookies in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, that's definitely fair to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there wasn't any.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there wasn't anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing else really gained as much
traction or as much as much steam,
[SPEAKER_04]: so to say, as the Gelato.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you didn't come with a lot of heat
like, you know, years past, we'd had
[SPEAKER_04]: Tropicana cookies and other other things
that have come through.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, there sure was pretty much the
one that was common across all the
[SPEAKER_04]: breeders was Gelato Cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too right, too right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on to our next award.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, I want to do Clone of the Year 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a guess because I
don't think it takes much imagination to
[SPEAKER_00]: guess this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a long shot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say the Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, how did you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not supposed to sell the Mac.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, only the coolest of the cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's an interesting one,
you know, because this one, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: been in the work for like three years now,
hasn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to say, it's got it's
had enough steam behind it for the last
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of years to be definitely,
you know, I'm not sure how it how it all
[SPEAKER_04]: has worked out or if everybody's happy or
not happy about the Mac being in
[SPEAKER_04]: circulation and sold and available to most
people.
[SPEAKER_04]: But initially it was a harder strain to
get for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, 2019, we really saw it in
full force, you know, dispense fees were
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rappers are talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every cup has several Mac one entries in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Instagram has photos of it is just
the Clone of the Year without question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question is, will it continue on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like we've reached peak Mac
one status yet?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard, of course, I hear a bit from
everybody, but I've heard mixed reviews on
[SPEAKER_04]: the Mac.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear, you know, great and frosty and all
that wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also hear it doesn't have a lot of
flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of smells like my arm.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the stuff I've gotten has
been has been frosty for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a breeding component from breeder
side, I would think that that would be
[SPEAKER_04]: that would make anything that it would
touch, you know, it would enhance it if
[SPEAKER_04]: you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to give some honorable shout
outs for Clone of the Year 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first one that jumped to mind for
me, and I'm thinking you might agree with
[SPEAKER_00]: me, is Lemon Peel from our buddy Archive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Lemon Peel or is it what's he
calling it?
[SPEAKER_04]: One star, one star as it was known.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I got to take credit to get on
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the first podcast I'm on or you
check on the Facebook in 2000,
[SPEAKER_04]: a year and a half ago or two years ago,
I was freaking out about that strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had given me some on a drop and I
actually I went out to the car like three
[SPEAKER_04]: times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at my hotel just so I could get high
and smoke that weed when it was gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like I like made a song about it,
you know, because it was like my jar was
[SPEAKER_04]: empty and I was so sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was it was definitely something
special.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hit him back up that night and I was
like, dude, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next week I saw that he had
renamed it one star.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that and just just to throw out a
monkey in the monkey wrench in the
[SPEAKER_04]: insorts, you know, that's from T.R.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rojo, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Archive popped it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But credit goes to T.R.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rojo as far as creator of the stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's you can only really get
cross us of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he I think he said he doesn't
have F2s or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I think it's a good good
entry for clone of the year, because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: truly a clone, you know, like it was just
the female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all there is of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the great thing about Siege is your
feet, your phenol.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're looking for that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so T.R.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rojo released it, which he gives credit
to.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was it was Archive that selected it
and found that particular phenotype that
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody is in love with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I was I was rather surprised as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I hit up Archive, I was like,
when is that going to be released?
[SPEAKER_04]: And yada, yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, oh, yeah, I didn't do that,
you know, which is which is Fletcher.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's that's that's his credits.
[SPEAKER_04]: What he would do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, he would be like,
no, that's not mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's this dude's because that's what he
does.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a predator.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he doesn't want to get called
out on anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So but yeah, that's it was it's a great
strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I loved it to death.
[SPEAKER_04]: The few times I've had the rosin has been
amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the flower itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know obsolete in love with it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, moving on to our next category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, we have the Hall of Fame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one was an interesting one
because there's really just a few
[SPEAKER_00]: contenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of think that the obvious
choice in people's mind might be something
[SPEAKER_00]: like OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, of course, these strains have been
audited in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as like this is the first time
recognizing how good some of these strains
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I thought OG is a little a
little before us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that it's kind of undeniable
at this point that Girl Scout Cookies is
[SPEAKER_00]: really the Hall of Fame pick for 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything it's given rise to,
the gelato, the sherb, the do-si-do,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mendo breath, it's basically countless
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's the modern version of
the OG and the popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got the youth market in its
grips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's undeniable.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think, Mr. Bean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Hall of Fame status?
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely is from a from from a
strange perspective, from a breeder's
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, you know, we'll have to throw that crib
completely out of the ring.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just I'm just going to take a like a
breeding point of view here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, you know, I'd like to know maybe
and maybe it goes back to the OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as far as who made it, there's a
story behind it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a myth, there's a legend behind
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But whoever's whoever actually created the
strain or meant to meant to do it,
[SPEAKER_04]: or if they meant to at all, isn't hasn't
come forward, so to say, like it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I know who I believe it is,
but and it wasn't burner, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so from a breeder standpoint, no way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But from a strange standpoint,
all day, like it's been just used in so
[SPEAKER_04]: many things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, it's one definitely of this of
this time period that's taken the scene by
[SPEAKER_04]: storm as undeniable, whether you like it
or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: It you know, you can't deny the popularity
of cookies that it's that the market's
[SPEAKER_04]: made on the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you pointed to one of the most
important parts about it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like most big things, it was bag seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it wasn't it wasn't meant to be done
if they if whoever meant to do it,
[SPEAKER_04]: they would have extras, they'd have a
mother, they'd have a father, they'd have
[SPEAKER_04]: pieces to put the puzzle again.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if there's never a male, then that
means that that was never meant to be and
[SPEAKER_04]: and and and backseat strains aren't bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if we want to talk about backseat,
we're talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe some headband, we're talking about
some OG Kush, we're talking, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: some some great strains, maybe seven out
of the top 10 are gonna be backseat never
[SPEAKER_04]: meant to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just did.
[SPEAKER_04]: But definitely cookies has made its has
made its mark.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as it was, like, like, like I say,
as it came from bag seed, bag seed,
[SPEAKER_04]: it shall have and so it keeps it keeps
throwing seeds to this day, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a female girl scout cookie plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A motto to live your life by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next category is hottest new breeder to
the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this one, we had quite a lot of
entries, but the overwhelming answer was
[SPEAKER_00]: our buddy from Alaska, A.K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beanbrains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, sporting a huge wave of just
old school genetics, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year he's had a lot of success with
his some Mac crosses with a male Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: He found and selected and just the most
important thing to mention is his new TKNL
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes, which has taken the scene by storm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's got the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the unique pairing of the old school
Kush versus the old school Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's a really beautiful hybrid and
it's a fantastic way to kind of start off
[SPEAKER_00]: his breeding platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exciting to see what's on the
horizon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like some great building blocks,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not admittedly as familiar with them
as as you are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love Alaska.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been there five times and their
canvassing was just was just coming out of
[SPEAKER_04]: the woodwork, so to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a great place.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, it definitely has some good
building blocks and TKNL Hayes definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: sounds if you can bring that bring the
flowering time down on it to where it's
[SPEAKER_04]: reasonable from a breeder's standpoint,
definitely sounds interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_00]: A.K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beanbrains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for coming on the show and
congratulations on winning the hottest new
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder on the block award for 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks a lot for getting me another
shout out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm really shocked and humbled by the
fact that I would get an award like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, well deserved, well deserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give us a bit of a rundown.
[SPEAKER_00]: What has 2019 been like for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I avoid the crowds like normal and
kind of stick to my own thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just enjoy solidifying some lines and
getting them basically back out and
[SPEAKER_03]: shouting their names out a little bit and
letting some of the inexperienced people
[SPEAKER_03]: get a better taste of what is available in
the old heirloom line.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've just been working on that and
thinking about that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are there any specific heirloom lines
you have in store for 2020?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you struck a hot chord with me when
we were speaking about the old tie and
[SPEAKER_03]: chocolate ties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did kind of I had some seed stock
from different various sources and then
[SPEAKER_03]: went and grabbed a bunch up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to run pretty good searches
on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus the chocolate I have is in the F4 and
I like chocolate a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I got Conorado's chocolate tie
and NL 2x5.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was giving that out as freebies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anybody slept on that, they're
crazy because it's outstanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the NL side's real great too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of little things like that and a
little bit of 80s chocolate tie that was
[SPEAKER_03]: crossed to Boggs Strawberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't imagine some of the flavors
and then excited about crossing the
[SPEAKER_03]: chocolate ties.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put it on the lemon tree and
some of the old standby mothers that I
[SPEAKER_03]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how about any collabs for 2020 on the
horizon?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've been playing around a
little bit with Professor P from Dynasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me and him get along real good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we both benefit each other on anything
that we work on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a little bit going on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's been good enough to gift me his
medical cuts since I'm really in need of
[SPEAKER_03]: some good medical herb.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he passed me his grapefruit web,
which is a seven and a half to seven and a
[SPEAKER_03]: half.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's four percent protein every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like really good smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one of the things I kind of
think is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's he's done me some favors there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of working a little bit on a NL
revival that is coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's with Mr. Bob Hemphill and I.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have quite a few sources of NL1,
NL2.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have much NL2, but a lot of NL5
sources, a couple NL1 sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to do a big run out on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's got a bunch of mine and I've got
a bunch of his.
[SPEAKER_03]: So within the next year, probably this
time next year, we'll have some pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: exciting original old heirloom NL as it
used to stand in the mid 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like 2020 has got some really
exciting releases in store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wind back, though, one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019 just wrapped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you most happy with?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you recommend to people?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I've always been big on things that
are just super durable, heirloomish.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I love the Friesland that I've worked
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the Durban that I've worked with.
[SPEAKER_03]: The vintage blueberry there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll hold their own against almost any
strains, but they'll weather the worst
[SPEAKER_03]: summers and they'll handle heats and
droughts and they're bug resistant and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're mold and mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really like those and I push those
along.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people request them and really want
them anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: They hit me up and I'm usually not able to
keep it made up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one thing, but I'm always loving
the TK crosses that I've been working
[SPEAKER_03]: with.
[SPEAKER_03]: The TK G13 hash plant, F4 and F5.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting some really cool phenols out
of that and loving the old funky G13 that
[SPEAKER_03]: comes with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes out of that, even thinking about
crossing the airborne G13 from Tommy onto
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love that GK, I mean, the TK N05
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got a thousand grow reports and
people are, it's not me, but everybody's
[SPEAKER_03]: saying it'll hold its own with the very
best real OG and the top end hitters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Chem B, Chem 91 and Chem 4.
[SPEAKER_03]: I constantly get a lot of people telling
me it's about the best thing they have
[SPEAKER_03]: had, no ceiling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the fact they haven't had a lot
of that in circulation for 20 years and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the first time they're coming across
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's good to hear it and continue with
that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a bulldog chewing on their Christmas
toy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of figured that was what was
happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tugging up a storm too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, some really good answers in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess just onto the final part,
you know, did you have any comments or
[SPEAKER_00]: shout outs you wanted to make just in
regards to 2019?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I had quite a few people I really
wanted to catch at Emerald and I missed
[SPEAKER_03]: the harvest cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't get around, I missed a lot of
people, friends flowing from all over the
[SPEAKER_03]: place.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel bad I never did hook up with about
20 guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did on the other hand, get a hookup with
a lot of friends and it's great to see
[SPEAKER_03]: them every single year.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to see you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to see all my West coast
buddies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really enjoy getting around and I just
would like thank everybody that's given me
[SPEAKER_03]: a hand over the year and a ton of support.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love the people shouting me out and
meeting with me and thanking me for what
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just something I've really
enjoyed the whole time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really cool to see it come to
fruition that, you know, people are
[SPEAKER_03]: putting the work out and then showing me
back the results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to my customers, you know,
and general public.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, congratulations on winning
Hottest New Breeder on the Block Award and
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks so much for coming on the show,
A.K.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beanbrains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, maybe this year you'll be up
here and I'll show you around this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait to go hunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fishing, fishing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't kill all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can just fish a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So up next, we're going to do the most
anticipated seed drop of 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually had a tied first because we
had both a tie within the fan selection as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as within my own mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it very hard to discern the clear
winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tied first, we have the upcoming
blue bonnet lines from Riot Seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: which sports the blue bonnet male from
Texas Resin Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is essentially a blueberry
offering that was more refined by Lone
[SPEAKER_00]: Star to generally attempt to lock down
more of the blueberry flavors than,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, DJ's previous work had done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of the crosses are looking really
nice and exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm particularly looking forward to the
blueberry cross bubble gum, which is meant
[SPEAKER_00]: to have that really nice blueberry syrup
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this was tied for equal first
place with the one and only Karma,
[SPEAKER_00]: whose new A5 haze work is just looking to
take the haze lovers to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is essentially a northern A5 haze
cross that comes from original Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: stock from when he was releasing under the
seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, it's just the pure old
school, super strong, super sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be crosses with it as
well as S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mr. Beam, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue bonnet versus A5 haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one are you more excited for?
[SPEAKER_04]: He locked me in a corner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to pick Riot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love how Riot's a great breeder and he's
always one to give credit and like we
[SPEAKER_04]: talked about earlier about Archive being a
guy not to take undue credit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gives credit to Lone Star, kicks back
to Texas Resident Company.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it should be really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had a lot of guys hit me up in the
Instagram and in my chats track,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, hey, when are you going to get it?
[SPEAKER_04]: When are you going to get it?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I definitely think that's a hard
choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the other side with Karma,
we also carry Karma.
[SPEAKER_04]: Karma's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hazes, I don't think that this current
smoking generation has really had much
[SPEAKER_04]: interaction with the hazes or as much
because they've been, like we discussed
[SPEAKER_04]: with the hype strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a hype strain that's a haze,
like not currently.
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't, at least there hasn't been
in the sort of hype term that we go to
[SPEAKER_04]: mention.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so hazes could really come and knock
people out and it could be very
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it's just getting that flower time
down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that some of those strains
that are 12, 14, 13, 15 weeks really are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a really valid point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's interesting because a lot
of the Die Hard fans who populate places
[SPEAKER_00]: like Instagram create this environment
where it seems like this huge demand and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone will buy it when it comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you hear these breeders talk
about how when they invest the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy, sometimes it doesn't translate
in sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, it's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a catchy name and a great picture
sell, you know, a thousand packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some guys do put a lot of,
you know, all the guys put a lot of work
[SPEAKER_04]: into it and there's a lot of failure
before there is success.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's a lot of stuff that you
don't want to release or that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, once you build up your rep,
if you release something that's shady,
[SPEAKER_04]: all you can do is just kill your rep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I've told my guys, it takes,
you know, five years to build your rep,
[SPEAKER_04]: five minutes to lose it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're extra careful as far as
testing and putting stuff out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are some home runs, but at the
same time, every home run, there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple, you know, strikeouts for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to give some honorable
mentions because in this section we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: large number of people who started giving
some suggestions, basically not for say a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed drop of 2020, but kind of a whole
line from a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially we got an overwhelming
number of mentions for the launch of
[SPEAKER_00]: crickets and cicadas, which is the new
seed company from Mr. Bob Hemphill and
[SPEAKER_00]: Hannibal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I definitely want to give them a
shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge number of people who are
really excited for these lines to drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're working with a range of really
old school, exotic genetics, like skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: tangerine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking about tangerine skunk
from Barneys Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about skunk tangerine,
which comes from Oregon kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as well as things like Northern Lights
and the nice land races from when they
[SPEAKER_00]: were working at Coastal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these cool old school stuff
getting crossed in new ways to the more
[SPEAKER_00]: modern stuff like Thin Mints and Uroji
Cushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think these guys are going to
make some really good waves next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep an eye out for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a really excellent
selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out for sure, because I know that
they were with Coastal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew that they had moved up west and
they had split from Coastal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool, everything was good with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's nice to hear that they're back out
and ready to release some really good
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And shout out again to Oregon Kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, it's nice seeing breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give respect to where it comes from and
not just trying to rename things and say,
[SPEAKER_04]: I made this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, everybody worked with something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to hear him give a shout out to
Oregon Kid Ken, that really good dude,
[SPEAKER_04]: did a lot for the scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something a lot of people don't
see is we'll say shout out to Oregon Kid
[SPEAKER_04]: and you'll think, oh, that's a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, these were guys who did things and
they didn't need to do things,
[SPEAKER_04]: like who would meet people off the
internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I have a hard time meeting people off
the internet to date, you know what I
[SPEAKER_04]: mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: But you'd meet people off the internet to
do illegal felonies with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I would meet you and I would give you
a clone and if you're a cop, you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: to arrest me.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so these guys were out doing the dirty
when nobody else would.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's kind of, you know,
they were rebels or looked at poorly in
[SPEAKER_04]: their time period, but now, you know,
shout outs weren't really counting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Oregon Kid's got some stuff
working around that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in Washington, but that's nice to
see that they're working with his stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be cool to see some stuff from
Oregon Kid as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oregon Kid's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd met up with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had him on a couple of shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a good dude and has done a lot for
the scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it goes unmentioned and isn't
making, he's, you know, a lot,
[SPEAKER_04]: this green rush, a lot of people will get,
you know, oh, everybody's making thousands
[SPEAKER_04]: of millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, these guys didn't, you know,
they didn't, they're lucky they didn't get
[SPEAKER_04]: five to 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so it's nice to see if he would
be able to capitalize somehow on that and
[SPEAKER_04]: make come out with some seeds or some come
out with something, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: He definitely put that Pacific Northwest
on the map for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So onto the next category, we have the
most impactful seed drop of 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one might have a bit of a
surprising answer for some people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm really confident in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the most impactful seed drop
2019 was the Australian Bastard Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: from CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think, I think Caleb's a great
breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely have enjoyed listening to
your podcast with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Caleb, their lead breeder from
CSI.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that he has inspired to the
triangle line as well, but that Australian
[SPEAKER_04]: Bastard, of course, it was a shoe in.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're an Australian Bastard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I set you up for that, didn't I?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I kind of did.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I think Caleb has been in the
scene and a vital part of the scene for a
[SPEAKER_04]: great many years and he has a great,
great library.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's a big award and that's
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you find familiar with the
Australian Bastard, so to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's part of what plays
into why he won it is that it's so rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even people in Australia as well
versed with things as like myself or
[SPEAKER_00]: others, even more well versed,
they've never seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that he got it successfully,
you know, did a repopulation, has got the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds out to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of the aspects of why
it's so impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the biggest thing for me is
that it's not really the seeds themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ABC, it's the potential that it has to
affect future morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, imagine like a cookies BX3
that is everything you want in cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: but looks like the ABC and you can grow it
in your front yard and no one would ever
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's where the real value in it
lies down the track.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he's working towards that type
of thing already.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just the whole fact that it was
something that could have just have gone
[SPEAKER_04]: off into into into being lost forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But instead it was taken by a quality
breeder, repopulate, as you say,
[SPEAKER_04]: remixed, fixed, brought back to life and
then redistributed to the masses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a that's a that's a big circle
of life, so to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely see some things in it because
I I'm not familiar with the Australian
[SPEAKER_04]: Bastard myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a few, but I'm not familiar with
the strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to go definitely have to go pick
that one up and we're in relief here.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds interesting for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, to me, it kind of tied into
the work you guys are doing with Humboldt
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedco and Nate with the Freak Show
project.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Freak Show just went on pre-sale
today.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Freak Show.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a different plant, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's similar to the ABC and that,
you know, it's got that same potential to
[SPEAKER_00]: really disguise things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's, you know,
that may be the cool new thing that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going for is how do we how do I put it in
plain sight without getting nailed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because everybody's doing it these these
these time of days.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
Everybody's growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, the Freak Show, the Freak Show
is definitely something that looks like it
[SPEAKER_04]: looks like could be very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eric Nuggets, Nugshots did a video of that
and that guy's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that video.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see what the Freak Show entails.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll definitely go go pick up the ABC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to give a few quick
honorable mentions for Strain of the Year.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are probably the more conventional
ones on a technical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congrats to, again, Caleb from CSI for
doing the TKS1s, a feat that's never
[SPEAKER_00]: really commercially been done due to how
hard the triangle is to actually reverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congrats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also got the Sauer BX2 from
Karma.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people were really hyped on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the biggest talking point and the
one I want you to talk a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: for me is we had an overwhelming response
from people who said that the most
[SPEAKER_00]: impactful seed drop of this year was Candy
Rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that really it just indicated
how fresh this is still in people's mind
[SPEAKER_00]: for all the wrong reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight hundred bucks for breeders that you
don't know who didn't do the thing that
[SPEAKER_04]: they told you they did, first of all.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like buying a bag like here,
smell this bag of weed and buy these seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this bag of weed has nothing to do
with that bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: That box of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, are you selling me the seeds of that
weed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, it's the classic bait
and switch, but on a luxury edition,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I know about the Candy Rain and I
guess one of the sad things is last year
[SPEAKER_04]: we did we did like a little cup kind of me
and Dunn did it in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_04]: People gave us stopped by the booth.
[SPEAKER_04]: They gave us give us allegedly gave us a
gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: We gave him 10 percent off.
[SPEAKER_04]: We sampled them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of those samples we got was Candy
Rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was like of all the things,
it was probably the definitely the
[SPEAKER_04]: smallest and maybe not maybe not the
worst, but it was definitely down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just so bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I got notoriously from it was
like I heard five out of 30, like two out
[SPEAKER_04]: of 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were the numbers coming back as far
as germination rates.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when anything is that bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I was talking to Jay Beasley and
about the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's like, I had to go and fix it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go do these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, he tried to go contact all
the people that had bought it and just,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, send them free, free gear
because he felt bad for the cookies fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but, you know, that's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good that the public got it,
that they understand that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: just because it's eight hundred bucks
doesn't make it good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get taken by the hype.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm glad I dodged that one with a
bullet.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, cookies moving forward,
you know, they have a little bit different
[SPEAKER_04]: of a game plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll see how that goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That works out for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, yeah, that's that's kind of breeders
just proving that they didn't do what they
[SPEAKER_04]: did, like how that London Boundgate go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the interesting the interesting
thing about this one is that it
[SPEAKER_00]: technically actually happened in 2018,
but it's still so fresh in the mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the other thing which leaves
it fresh in the mind is the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: people were waiting for something to be
done about the situation in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that failed to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's where it's really kind
of rubbed a bit of salt in the wounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, this poll was done before
the current drama cookies are facing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was at the recent Emerald Cup,
the prevalence of bud rot or botrytis in
[SPEAKER_00]: the outdoor flower they were selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like they go from drama to
drama.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't hear about this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell you what, that's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's horrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like as a as a breeder or as a solid
grower, you would know that and you would
[SPEAKER_04]: see it by trimming it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never let that touch your table.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that just goes back to the point
that they didn't make the cookies because
[SPEAKER_04]: if they did that or they were responsible
for that, they never would have let that
[SPEAKER_04]: hit their table.
[SPEAKER_04]: They would have spotted it way before that
and pulled it and seen it for anybody saw
[SPEAKER_04]: it and blasted it in some high priced oil
that they sold you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because nobody had mold or botrytis
anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just have a lot of oil these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's horrible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's is horrible that whatever they
were selling had had that on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only did they have it tested,
but to have let that go and let them sell
[SPEAKER_04]: that, especially at their prices.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got great marketing people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give them that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing they've got down pat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on that same topic, you know,
you fit that category in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from your point of view, from CETNL's
point of view, what was the most impactful
[SPEAKER_00]: seed drop for you guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't I can't pick my favorite child.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have I have a lot of good children.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all do different work and unique
work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just happy to get the gear that I
get from them and be able to make it make
[SPEAKER_04]: it make it make it to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any honorable shout outs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you mentioned earlier in the
year to me that you were thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the story and cream drop from Exotic
as one contender.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's comparing apples to oranges,
so to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exotic is in a is in a different category.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to say, I don't know, he he's crushing
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He just he just crushes it for now for
people who are looking for for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: For what?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if each breeder did this, if this stuff
that was that we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_04]: if this was just done out of a book that
you could read, I wouldn't need 50
[SPEAKER_04]: different breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd have one because you would be doing it
by the numbers and it would be no science.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's each breeders unique and different.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all look for different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exotic, what he goes for and his clientele
that they go for and what they're excited
[SPEAKER_04]: about are rock hard frosty nugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and he's you know, he hits it out of
the park every single time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems that as far as his releases go,
he doesn't hit it out of the park every
[SPEAKER_04]: single time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these trains never make it to
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll dispose of them before they even get
to see the light of day.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the stuff he's been releasing just
just crushes it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's doing a fem line right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have that drop on New Year's Eve.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got six different strains,
the grease monkey fems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those should, you know, there's crush at
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: He sold, he said he sold out of most of
his most of his regular stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: 80 percent is regular stock in the first
hour at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: So his, I told him, I said, what are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, you left gear at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I didn't expect it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But but no, exotic is he's a different
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: But some of the some of the newer guys we
had we released this year, the ivory,
[SPEAKER_04]: ivory genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jeff, we started working with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: His his drops was really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We added him to the bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's had a really good uptake this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We added a Muerta at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got a really good following and
really good gear and has been,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, definitely has worked these
lines and has had some had some good
[SPEAKER_04]: strains done loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: They released their recent collab.
[SPEAKER_04]: Microtech had a good release.
[SPEAKER_04]: DJ Short releases Breeder series.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's just there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't pick, you know, one over the
other.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was definitely some because each
Breeder is releasing just about,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, two or three times a year now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've gotten it so up to a point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when a Breeder really holds back and
does something out of the ordinary,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's when it'll get,
you know, truly that unique, unique area.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, everybody's doing two or
three times a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And and depending on the customer,
what you're looking for, you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a different Breeder that did it for
you this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a guy that likes sativas or line
races, then then so and so did it for you
[SPEAKER_04]: this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he wouldn't be going for exotic
because that'd be the opposite of what you
[SPEAKER_04]: want.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like when you put exotic and DJ Short
on the same panel, they it's just so night
[SPEAKER_04]: and day like DJ Short wants big,
leafy, larvae buds, because that's what
[SPEAKER_04]: makes the best hash, which does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exotic wants frosty, hard nugs,
because that's what flowers the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: He likes to smoke because he does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so depending on their viewpoint,
you're going to have a different guy that
[SPEAKER_04]: that's your Breeder.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nice try, but I'm not picking one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant, brilliant diplomatic answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings us to the big final
category for this year, the Breeder of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Year Award.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for 2019, Breeder of the Year,
not too surprising, goes to Caleb of CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had an absolutely huge year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to just start rattling off a
list that's going to sound endless,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the Skittles S1s, the TK S1s,
Trainwreck S1s and Cheese S1s in the
[SPEAKER_00]: works, all the hybrids with all of those
to things like Girl Scouts to OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does huge 80 to 100 plant phenohunts of
his own work, finds the keepers and then
[SPEAKER_00]: breeds with those keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done Durban Poison S1s, Kali Orange
S1s, Bubblegum S1s, Old Family Purple S2s,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as his Pirates of the Emerald
Triangle, which is a lot more regular
[SPEAKER_00]: based work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's done an extremely large amount of
preservation work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done some technical feats,
which was the TK, the Triangle Kush S1s,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as taking out the most impactful
strain with the ABC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fairly undeniable.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been on fire this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll say he kind of caught me with
my pants down, to be honest, buddy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have Caleb on the bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said earlier, I think he's an
awesome Breeder and I think I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: sleeping on him, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been doing my customers maybe a
little disservice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that we had or we got most of
those drops, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think I'll be giving a call to
Caleb as soon as we get a CSI out,
[SPEAKER_04]: as soon as we're done with this chat and
restocking all those items.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a list.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you just, you named them all,
you rallied them all off.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just like, I don't think I got
that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I got that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was right underneath my nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sometimes when you're looking,
it goes the same with seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes when you're looking for the Babe
Ruth, you had the one you wanted right
[SPEAKER_04]: underneath your nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, that's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's cause yeah, that's a,
you know, the technical fee that TK S1 is
[SPEAKER_04]: a pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard if not impossible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I will definitely have to go
check out all of his work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, that's pretty awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big, big shout out to Caleb and
props for all the work this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, obviously there's a lot of
honorable mentions for some other breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: we should give shout outs to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the kind of the other, the other
two who I think have had really big years,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to give a shout out to was
obviously Capulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's come out with his caps, frozen
lemons, the freezer burn crosses and the
[SPEAKER_00]: numerical crosses in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's had a pretty big year,
both in terms of what he's been doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially he's been crushing it as well
as the Mac one doing very well for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other big shout out we want to give to
is to Duke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've seen a lot of the granny
skunk lines really come to fruition within
[SPEAKER_00]: public gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing some incredible keepers
come out of the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most notably I've seen some, extremely
fine examples of the 6 million and the
[SPEAKER_00]: stash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, two really big notable shout
outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of the fan polls,
we got a lot of people chiming in saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that they really thought trichome jungles
had a good year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had some nice work with his lilt as
well as his cherry spice lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally honorable mention to Karma for
his sour BX2s as well as some colabs and
[SPEAKER_00]: some future work, which people are excited
for.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds like a very, very diverse list
of some definitely some big hitters.
[SPEAKER_04]: To our buddy, Duke Diamond.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dominion may be not breeding anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can pick up his packs,
definitely lock those packs down.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that he said in his instance
or whatnot, and he told me that he might
[SPEAKER_04]: be putting some stuff in retirement after
the first of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that being said, great pick and
definitely Caleb winning and being in that
[SPEAKER_04]: field of breeders that you just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_04]: You thanked Caleb for everything that he's
done this past year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank him for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We go back and thank Caleb for everything
he's done over the past years.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't just come out of the closet,
unfortunately, or don't just come out of
[SPEAKER_04]: the grow room and become breeder of the
year, have release of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of work there, which people
don't realize.
[SPEAKER_04]: We say a lot of the stuff's bag seed,
and a lot of it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also a lot of good work being
done.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that Caleb over the years has
preserved these items, has kept these
[SPEAKER_04]: things, worked these things, had a passion
for it, and a little weird curiosity that
[SPEAKER_04]: he's put to, he's obviously made very,
very popular and very good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm definitely excited to pick up
those new lines, and I'll have to go check
[SPEAKER_04]: those out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that says a lot for CSI Humboldt,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's had a killer year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and was he inspector?
[SPEAKER_04]: What was his online handle?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, inspector.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so he's inspector.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that guy's been on the forums for
years and years and years, and you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: just do that stuff overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's obviously a great 2019 for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big congratulations to everyone who
won an award or got a shout out this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's skip.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how was your, speaking of Mr. Bob
Pentel and moving up north, how was your
[SPEAKER_04]: trip to Emerald Cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's on the way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was far less big marquee tents
holding stalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a really small number of
familiar faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I didn't recognize any of the
people running the booths.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were big corporate companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually saw one of the girls who was
working one of the booths on a Greyhound
[SPEAKER_00]: bus a week earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was catching a Greyhound down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it just all clicked for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, wow, they're shipping trimmers
in from northern Humboldt to run these
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate booth stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just fucking trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a few companies who were trying
to do good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to name names because... But
basically, yeah, it was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was the Cookies tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was probably about 10 breeders in
total at the whole venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them weren't even selling
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the big names were selling seeds
like Capuleta, Swamp Boys, Exotic Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys are always going to draw a big
crowd and do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of smaller guys just weren't
represented at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just didn't feel like the normal
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard anything about it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's hard to hear from you,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because definitely you've been there a
couple of times, but to hear that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: gotten so corporate from a guy who's been
I don't know how many times you've been
[SPEAKER_04]: three, four times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's... It's got to break your
heart seeing it go downhill so quick
[SPEAKER_04]: because I'm sure I can feel it.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I first met you, I believe... You
turn around, there was Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_04]: You turn around, there was Homegrown
Natural Wonders or there was Afton Don or
[SPEAKER_04]: Mojave, somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubba or Josh D.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's... I had a feeling last year
was getting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this year, they were not wonderful to
me either.
[SPEAKER_04]: I should always watch what I say,
but...
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of left us hanging last year and
this year we didn't give them the chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: We decided we're going to sit it out and
we didn't want the corporate feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So instead, we did what was called the
Digital Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we did... All the breeders that
couldn't go to the Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_04]: they did their release with us on the
Digital Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we had a Fishing Auto do a release,
Seattle Chronic Seeds do a release,
[SPEAKER_04]: a couple of other... Do Diamond?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do Diamond did a release, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we did panels as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we had panels on our form where
they called in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan was the moderator, had Kaia from
Pacific Northwest Roots, Bog, Duke called
[SPEAKER_04]: in, JD Short, Chris from Seattle Chronic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are all in the forms on seats
here now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could just sit from the comfort of
your couch and order the gear,
[SPEAKER_04]: get the drop, watch a panel and not have
to wait in line, not pay 150 bucks,
[SPEAKER_04]: not get rained on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the Digital Cups are going to
be something going forward or do you just
[SPEAKER_00]: think people will just...
[SPEAKER_00]: Find other events that have got more
applicable kind of rules and regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: that are a good environment?
[SPEAKER_04]: On that, honestly, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Digital Cup, we had three categories.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the best picture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grow out our gear, send us the best
picture and we'll choose and you get a
[SPEAKER_04]: nice pack.
[SPEAKER_04]: You win a very nice prize.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second thing, we had pimp the merchandise
category where pick your... You send us
[SPEAKER_04]: images or logos or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think of seats here now.
[SPEAKER_04]: What comes to mind if we pick your design
and use it on t-shirts and give you a nice
[SPEAKER_04]: prize?
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we had another category as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to edit that because I'm
stoned.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot what the last category was.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you had three categories which you
could enter and then people would win
[SPEAKER_04]: different prizes and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I definitely think it will have...
We're going to keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a great success with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did great in sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so not every breeder can afford five
to 10,000 or is licensed and can't get a
[SPEAKER_04]: booth at Thermo Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yet they all have their... Strange
that they've been working on all summer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're just giving them an outlet to
sell it on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's pretty thrilled.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had over 5,000 photos submitted in
three days.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm excited to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially because that's one of the
incentives about getting down to these
[SPEAKER_00]: events is that there's good sales,
there's a lot of good information to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's really what draws
people to the events more than maybe the
[SPEAKER_00]: music or the other things which the
Emerald Cup seems to think is the draw
[SPEAKER_00]: card.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's an excellent observation
because I've thought that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you guys are putting way too much
emphasis on your music draw and you should
[SPEAKER_04]: be putting it on your information and your
education and your people draw.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they do what they do and they'll come
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as your last question goes,
as far as what we'll see and what the new
[SPEAKER_04]: thing will be, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I do know is that it seems that rec
kills shows, period.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Washington used to have shows,
had high times cups, had this,
[SPEAKER_04]: had that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rec passed, no public consumption,
killed Washington for shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Portland passed, rec.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had used to have shows there, high times
there, same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rec passed, killed shows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once rec passes, if you consume in public
or you sell things without paying your
[SPEAKER_04]: taxes on it, the state is right there to
watch you and they'll shut you down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'll bet there's probably at least
50 to 100 regulators there at Emerald Cup
[SPEAKER_04]: probably watching.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you didn't see a lot of seed
companies selling because they didn't have
[SPEAKER_04]: the correct permits or licenses needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I don't know that California will,
Californian whole, not just Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that Californian whole will
come back and have what we saw as
[SPEAKER_04]: festivals back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know, moving forward,
that the rest of the country that
[SPEAKER_04]: unfortunately the West Coast hasn't killed
it for you because it seems like these
[SPEAKER_04]: states, as they pass, they go quicker.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're quicker with the regulations,
right out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing this, they're doing this,
they're regulating how much electricity
[SPEAKER_04]: you can use and how much square footage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like, wait a minute, it took
Oregon like three years to figure that
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are coming out the gate with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that just to the bigger
thing, I think what festivals are left and
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis events that there are that have
public consumption are definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: numbered.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think their days are numbered.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're on the way out, but we still don't
see public consumption bill in the states
[SPEAKER_04]: where people can go and consume in public.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the states that have been passed the
longest, five and seven years,
[SPEAKER_04]: still do not have public consumption.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet you can drink alcohol and do it at a
bar, but you can't smoke in public.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting the kind of inequity of
it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wreck kills parties.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They say Wreck won't kill medical,
they're lying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a clear observation from
California's experiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that their taxes were insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I was there last year, I paid like
almost 30% tax on everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm sure it wasn't much less.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what else did you do while you were at
the Emerald Cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some recordings, got some cool
content recorded, which we'll talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hopefully be able to air soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a cool one hour video recording of
Mean Gene, myself and Mr. Bob Hemphill
[SPEAKER_00]: just talking about some old school strains
at Mean Gene's place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty wild, pretty wild video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the real strain heads will really
get a kick out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one will be a CT Now exclusive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you didn't tell me about that and you
got me super excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, those guys are Hemphills that have
some knowledge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mean Gene is, you know, I guess I think
that guy pops more seeds than anybody I
[SPEAKER_04]: know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be definitely very,
very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yourself being, you've got to be one
of the most educated guys I know in
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis as far as histories and stories
and know what comes from where and access
[SPEAKER_04]: to things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that would be very, very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting to hear that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what can we expect out of the podcast
in 2020?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to focus on trying to do
a bit more video content where possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, geography can make that hard at
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a long time, we've been trying to
line up some big names together,
[SPEAKER_00]: you and I.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we're at that point of
being able to clinch a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping for 2020 to be the year
where we kind of take things overboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we've been making some good
progress on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully the fans can have something
to look forward to and get a bit more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: behind the scene look at some of the
really big name breeders who have really
[SPEAKER_00]: put a lot of effort and contributed a lot
to the scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that with that just comes,
you know, with time, I think that I know
[SPEAKER_04]: that a lot of these breeders have maybe
mentioned to me, you know, how long that
[SPEAKER_04]: laws can stand for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't want to be public.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've been doing this thing for
the last seven years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was doing this for five years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like sort of the first statute of
limitations as far as I know that the
[SPEAKER_04]: statute of limitations is running out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that some people have expressed
concerns, but I am not going to go up
[SPEAKER_04]: there to admit who I am when they saw the
statute of limitations on me.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can still convict me for shit I did
five years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that now we're we're so far in
the legalization that these guys can start
[SPEAKER_04]: to come out and they believe it that we're
legal a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not just, you know, they're not so
quick to jump on the train of belief that
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody else is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they might be coming to light more
and say, yeah, I did this and I was a guy
[SPEAKER_04]: responsible for this and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully we can definitely see more of
that next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, God, if some of these people want to
come out of the shadows and kind of let us
[SPEAKER_00]: know what they're responsible for,
that would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that goes to, you know,
a lot of the guys are still in the shadows
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're still in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they had to be like if you were
if you were the guy who was making the
[SPEAKER_04]: most noise on the block and driving a
shiny car and weren't too much gold,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're the guy going down.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're the guy the cops are
going to look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they made it to where they are
believing that that's how they had to
[SPEAKER_04]: operate.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now they're not they're not going
to be the quickest ones to switch over and
[SPEAKER_04]: say, OK, sure, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to come out and say I did that
just so I can get busted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jerks, idiots.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so they're smart and they're not
quick, quick to jump on things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think I see more and more
of them believing that, hey, it's a real
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, it's it's people else.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other people are making money on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I might as well come out and get some,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they should.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely some of these guys deserve it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, should be interesting for 2020.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how are the laws in Australia coming
along?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are we this year compared to last
year?
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of awards, anybody in Australia
doing good things for for good people?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard a good analogy when I was in the
States, which is that Australia is about
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 years behind the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think about what things were
like in the late 80s in the States,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's about where it's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have a real medical scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's medical by name, but it's
essentially a system designed to keep you
[SPEAKER_00]: from actually getting any medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it was it was it was introduced by
the conservative government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, there was going to be
something up about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why are they legalizing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not their card.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they did was they figured it out
like they thought, well, legalized
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis will win over all the young
voters who aren't conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, we're not actually going
to legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to be legal in name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then so they didn't actually piss off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't actually piss the older
conservatives off, but they won over the
[SPEAKER_00]: young vote until the next election when
people realized what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to be honest, I'm not holding my breath
for anything legally groundbreaking to
[SPEAKER_00]: change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully if the the the Labor
government, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more progressive, if they get in
power, hopefully something will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of who's doing good things
like the states, you know, like we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about with Oregon Kid,
you know, there's there are some people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are just doing things at their own
risk and just trying to help progress the
[SPEAKER_00]: scene in little ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, shout out to all the homies
around Australia who are doing their best
[SPEAKER_00]: to Fino Hunt and to keep cuts and to share
cuts around with their mates and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because to me, that's what is driving the
scene at the moment, because it feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: we're at a bit of a political standstill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while politically things are a little
slow, we can still progress the scene
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves and do what you guys did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find good strains, grow good weed,
get it out to the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of what what
unfortunate, you know, pushed the states
[SPEAKER_04]: over as far as that goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hate to say it, but we passed
cannabis on the backs of children,
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially by I think that that CBD and
the discovery of it, but the science of it
[SPEAKER_04]: all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the medical the medical
benefits clearly from CBD, that although
[SPEAKER_04]: it's still a scheduled one narcotic,
you know, I mean, cannabis, it has this
[SPEAKER_04]: weird component called CBD that that has
made it medically viable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the belief of that and just
the science behind it and how it's used
[SPEAKER_04]: and just about like I can't go into a
store these days without seeing the hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: infused CBD infused.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that really helped push the
whole cannabis as a plant over the top is
[SPEAKER_04]: that there was a medical viability behind
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe the government did lie to you
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But so hopefully that, you know,
I'm not saying hopefully, but maybe that
[SPEAKER_04]: may may come to Australia to help them
pass it quicker because there's some
[SPEAKER_04]: serious, you know, CBG we know works as a
great component.
[SPEAKER_04]: CBN we now know is like the night night as
far as hemp goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so hemp and hemp and CBD and whatnot
have a big value as a whole industry on
[SPEAKER_04]: their own and millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so maybe that helped Australia see the
see the light of day or so to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we already see a little bit of
it, but yeah, hopefully it gets over the
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you having me on and I,
you know, it's, it's, it was interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: to listen to your selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I had nothing to do with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are, he picked them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I was, I think they're definitely hit
the nail on the head.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, once again, I applaud your
podcast.

for granted how wide your shipping service
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that there's some people who
wish you shipped to where they live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that maybe there's some things
in the backend of that happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soon enough, we can have everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as far as I know on that, we have a
whole new website that I've spoken about
[SPEAKER_04]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's been designed, finished and up and
running.
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely go check out the whole new
website.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a whole new shipping methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: We now offer a discrete shipping method.
[SPEAKER_04]: We offer also offer a flying monkeys
option.

options, international next day overnight,
[SPEAKER_04]: all those good things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have a hundred percent guarantee.

orders over 300 bucks as well as a rewards
[SPEAKER_04]: program.
