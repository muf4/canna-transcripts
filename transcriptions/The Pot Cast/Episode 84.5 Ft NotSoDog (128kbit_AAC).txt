[SPEAKER_01]: Mendo perps and so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without further delay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, that's interesting because you've
given me a nice little segue when you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned the lemon tree, because I was
going to say, Caleb at CSI has done some
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool crosses using the not so dog
headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the notable ones that I've
seen garner a lot of fanfare from the
[SPEAKER_01]: community, the Chem D cross headband and
the lemon tree cross headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can sort of understand why both of
them have a lot of popularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest, I've actually got a pack
of both of those and I've stashed them
[SPEAKER_01]: away for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, did you expect some of
these headband hybrids to get the popular
[SPEAKER_01]: reception that they have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are there any particular crosses
you're hoping to see happen with some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cuts you're associated with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, so that's like I gave I've
given various cuts to CSI, some of which
[SPEAKER_00]: like the headband he's he's already used
and released, some of which are still
[SPEAKER_00]: private or in the works or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was mostly just because I'm mostly
a private reader.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, once you start chatting
about a bunch of this stuff, and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: interest out there, and you want to you
want to figure out a way to spread it out
[SPEAKER_00]: to the community to some degree,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since he's so prolific, and he's also
popular and does a good job, he was a good
[SPEAKER_00]: vessel for that, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, yeah, there are some things
that I think that are unexpected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't grow any of the LA by lemon tree,
but I did grow at a project I did an
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor a few years ago, I did grow a ton
of his work outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did grow quite a few lemon tree and
other hybrids, Calio hybrids and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And much like train wreck, that turp that
we were talking about earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: the the citrus is a dominant turp in the
sense that it really pops up in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely something that combines
and gets passed on really strongly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of this a lot of the lemon stuff
would be you're going to smell a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my hope if if you grew some LA by
lemon tree is that the LA would lend some
[SPEAKER_00]: some gassiness and some skunk and some
potency to the the lemon tree side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would that would be the hope that I
would have is that it would give it would
[SPEAKER_00]: give it some legs, if you would.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Chem D by LA seems to be the most
popular one so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been getting a lot of wild
stuff out of that, which is cool because
[SPEAKER_00]: those two strains are I don't know,
I'm not really big on rating strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they would definitely go into like my
all time favorites category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it and I think they cross it seems like
they crossed really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still have people sending me pics
all the time of those hybrids and people
[SPEAKER_00]: really happy with what they're finding in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some great feedback and some people
might be a bit curious about what do you
[SPEAKER_01]: mean the LA maybe not entirely sure on the
backstory on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to get your version of events.
[SPEAKER_01]: The you know, the headband cut,
the not so headband cut also originally
[SPEAKER_01]: known as the LA Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that come to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get your hands on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever interact directly with
Mandelbrot or was that just sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: coincidental?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandelbrot and I were friends.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a buddy of mine who introduced
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: My homie, Josh, and he you know,
Mandelbrot was more into let's I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandelbrot was was deep into the Grateful
Dead hippies side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the early 2000s, he was getting it
more interested in switching over and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to mess around with some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it so happened that my buddy and I
stat I called Staten Island on the show
[SPEAKER_00]: before had been doing some projects
together and some breeding work over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last number of years together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had a whole big collection of,
you know, seeds and hybrids and stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: I had made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted to get started on a seed
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted to start messing around with
stuff, but he didn't really have very much
[SPEAKER_00]: stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he ended up he ended up getting a bunch
of seed for me, mostly superdog hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: superdog Maui, superdog by superdog,
various things, a handful of cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him a couple of my superdog
selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him my sour diesel, a couple of
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had gone down to L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: and he had gotten this head band that they
were calling the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you got to realize this was in the
very early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was before most people had heard of
or the really the Kush wave of L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: had happened, because obviously,
as we're both well aware, what became
[SPEAKER_00]: known as Kush was very different than this
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was very much more of a diesel cut,
very much more of a sort of a sour looking
[SPEAKER_00]: type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he brings it back up and he's like,
hey, I want to give you this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this other sour diesel and I have
this headband that I want to give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he drive he drives down from
Humboldt and he gives me two headbands and
[SPEAKER_00]: two sours, but they're unlabeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's like, just grow them,
save all the moms and grow them side by
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grow these things up and I'm showing
it to friends and everyone's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, it's all the same weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like none of these moms are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the rooms are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of the greenhouse is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, he gave you must have
given you his version of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This looks like sour to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for four or five months, I thought he
had messed up and just given me sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he came down to my house one day
and he walks into a room that was about 10
[SPEAKER_00]: days away from being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh, this is all L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must have not given I must have not
given you the sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the headband for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and actually, and so I asked him
for his sour and he's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what, the one you gave me is way nicer
than the one that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not even any point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he got it in 02 or 03 or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right in that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long time ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got it as you know, he got it as the
L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, but it was called a headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all I know about it,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he ended up starting Emerald Mountain
Seed, Emerald Mountain Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a lot of stuff that I had given him
and some of the stuff that he had and he
[SPEAKER_00]: blended that L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made you probably heard of it,
the 707 headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the that L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: cut cross to an Afghani he had that he
released as a seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he passed it out pretty freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I passed it out pretty freely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somehow I'm not going to say I'm the
only person that that has it, because that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be presumptuous.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does seem like it's not one of the
more reliable sours in the sense that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more environmentally
sensitive and people didn't hold on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somehow it seems like I ended up being
one of the only people that had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I started chatting about it,
it's got a terrible name, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sense that like it's the least
circulated headband.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you start talking about headband,
people want to know, is it the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Hemhill has?
[SPEAKER_00]: The man elite has?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the Loompa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's none of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you call it the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, obviously people think of Kush,
they think of TK or Ghost or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or Larry or Irene or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So its name isn't very descriptive in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was never called not so anything up
until I started doing the podcast with
[SPEAKER_00]: Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for lack of a better way of
describing it, people started trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify it as like, oh, it's this
headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, which one it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's the one not so has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of one of those ways where
like my name got organically added to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, fairly recently,
really, but it is I got it as L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, look, that makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, I think that from what I've
heard, that's actually a similar story
[SPEAKER_01]: with Loompa's headband.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like apparently he never called it
Loompa's headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just people.
[SPEAKER_01]: He traded it on the forums and people were
like, oh, this is the headband I got from
[SPEAKER_01]: Loompa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Loompa, you know, Loompa and I go
back and forth and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like he doesn't like me very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think he intentionally added his
name to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that then he got what's
weird about it is when you start adding
[SPEAKER_00]: names to things for people, a lot of times
people get protective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of their association with things.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's a weird pride element that
comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I, you know, and it's it's
also weird for me to talk about Mandelbrot
[SPEAKER_00]: because he's passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I typically like, you know,
and his, you know, his brother has a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company now and stuff and Emerald Mountain
Legacy and, you know, like his life and
[SPEAKER_00]: how he was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a little dicey to talk
about in some regards, but because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: shame because he passed away early.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unexpectedly and suddenly.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they he people want,
you know, when I talk about when I tell
[SPEAKER_00]: that story, sometimes people like,
oh, you're trying to take credit from
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to take this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think people get how cannabis
really was back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how you were talking about when
it came to the land race stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're standing on the shoulders of
others.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Mandel was standing on my shoulders to
get his seed company started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not standing on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm standing on the shoulders of Staten
Island and various other friends who gave
[SPEAKER_00]: me the strains that I ended up working
with that we made those seeds with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're standing on the shoulders of
the peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just keeps going back to where it's
like, well, who gets credit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, well, Wendy,
how did you hold the baton?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, did I give Mandel most of
what he used to start the seed company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that mean I'm responsible for all the
choices that he made and all the effort
[SPEAKER_00]: that he put in and everything he did after
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't even charge him back then,
because back then, like just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was, like I was saying in 2001,
2002, 2003, there was no outlets for
[SPEAKER_00]: American private breeders to really sell
their seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of us, we, you know, I would,
I mentioned it before on the show too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we, you know, we go to these harvest
festivals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be given 50 or a hundred seeds away
to friends all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got way more than I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was also pre-reversals for most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were all regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so yeah, I mean,
I gave, I gave Mandel probably over a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand thousand seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had so, so many, dude, like,
what was I going to do with like what,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, honestly, like, I mean,
I gave away seeds to all kinds of friends
[SPEAKER_00]: because, um, what, what would I do with
all of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets a bit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like, okay, I got,
I've got 50,000 seeds of superdog hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so every homey of mine that wanted
them, that wanted to pop them,
[SPEAKER_00]: that wanted to run them in their green
house, that wanted to do something with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was long before you,
there was really any weird ego in the
[SPEAKER_00]: American scene about like, Oh,
I'm going to make a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to, it was more like
weed nerds trading.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: More organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very much more so organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now it's like, people are like,
you try to honestly talk about it and
[SPEAKER_00]: people are like, Oh, you're trying to
steal thunder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has nothing to do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a different era.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really all I can say about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a different era.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like my home.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to start a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had way more seeds than I knew what to
do with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a couple of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted some more clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted some more stuff to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, here's 1200 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's 1400 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like nine different crosses of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: See what you find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I, uh, we're definitely going to
jump into that, but I want to quickly ask
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the thing and then we'll,
we'll loop back to it, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of the, the headband with lumpers
versus your one, how would you describe
[SPEAKER_01]: the differences?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think they're both two very good
ones that go around as the term headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think are the differences,
the similarities, and why do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: there are so many different headbands out
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels to me like it's, it's got to be
up there with sour in terms of like the
[SPEAKER_01]: number of different cuttings that go
around with the same name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, so there's different stories
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: To it, you know, um, I'll start with the
headband name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like headband ended up becoming a
popular name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it seemed like headband was also
tied into the, the sour diesel origin
[SPEAKER_00]: story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a lot of mystery around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when there's mystery around it and
there's money and there's rep to be made,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes names get tagged onto things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea why my, why the,
the headband, the LA that I have is called
[SPEAKER_00]: headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it, that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loompas, I think, and he might get real
mad at me for this, but I think it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: OGS one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my cut is very much in the sour or the
diesel type of family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, it's stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that it's got those similar turps
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got similar growth pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much in that family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Loompa is very much an OG Kush type,
you know, in, in my opinion, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enjoyable smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but to me, it's just a really nice
Kush, you know, like if you had that and
[SPEAKER_00]: you had ghost and you had triangle and you
had a few different things, it would fit
[SPEAKER_00]: right in that same movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've probably tried,
I call it, you know, I mean, people call
[SPEAKER_00]: it different names, but you've probably
tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That other one, I call it the 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, um, Matt elite has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, I see collective has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Hemphill has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, I think, I think it's the,
the one that's a skunk VA uses too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that one's a Kush and apparently,
uh, you know, there was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've probably heard the story,
but there was, there was some drama and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was maybe some violence or there was
some issues going on in Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: California over this cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this guy took it to, to San Francisco
and they didn't really want any of that
[SPEAKER_00]: drama following them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they intentionally renamed it headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the very simple version.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a couple of what I consider to
basically be OG Kush types as headband and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's so much confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where people are like, Oh, this is the day
record.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the original diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that headband and they all have
these very murky stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't necessarily know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be able to like explain every single
one of them to you, but I would just say
[SPEAKER_00]: that headband was a famous strain that
people wanted to tie strains that they had
[SPEAKER_00]: to that lineage and to that legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the legend was murky enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allowed for a lot of that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That certainly makes sense actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go back to our first question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We normally start with, take me back to
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your very first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is normally how, how you start,
but we really went off field on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first experience with cannabis was
basically Mexican, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the early nineties, when I started
smoking weed, I knew of two kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that you could get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get brown seeded cannabis that
was compressed and you could get hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: lesser compressed green cannabis that was,
you know, and, you know, the good stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: had less seeds and was less compressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the worst stuff had a lot more seeds
and a lot more stems and was heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: compressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my, in high school, that's kind of
really what we had access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was what was, you know, it was $20 an
eighth for brown weed and it was $30 an
[SPEAKER_00]: eighth for green weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, kind bud, which is what we,
you know, we all smoke now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first experienced that going to a dead
show when I was 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd never, I'd never seen weed that nice
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I like Mexican weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the effect that I got, I had plenty of
fun getting stoned on brown Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I came up in an era in America
where all the various imports that people
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about, like Colombian and Thai and
this and that and everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was all previous to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically just different grades of
Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was true in Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess in Florida, we'd see a little bit
of, of Jamaican, but the Jamaican was
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times that Jamaican would get
sprayed with raid, which was a cockroach
[SPEAKER_00]: killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was adulterated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was also a teenager.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like I had very good access.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't come from a family of pot smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of my, like I didn't, I don't have
one of those origin stories that my dad or
[SPEAKER_00]: my uncles or anyone like that got me into
it all early.
[SPEAKER_00]: My experience with weed was basically,
uh, friend groups, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your 15 or 16 or 17 year old
friend group have access to?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was sort of the start of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people get on here and they're
like, Oh, you know, my uncle was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this amazing stuff and he was smuggling
any of these rare seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not my start.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I would say that maybe like my
curiosity about weed and my drive to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: more is started from the fact that it was
so hard to get for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And figuring out information about it was
hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to realize that like,
when I started smoking, there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, maybe you could get some
high times, you know, and read some,
[SPEAKER_00]: read some stories and high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a few books out about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing weed in, when I was 18,
when I moved out of my parents' house,
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly because I wanted to be able to get
good weed, like I could get on dead tour
[SPEAKER_00]: and I couldn't find it reliably around me
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, look, you preempted my next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I was going to say, I find with most
younger people, the thing that stimulates
[SPEAKER_01]: them to start growing is getting exposed
to some like super phenomenal weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, wow, I've got to do this
for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say that it was on dead tour
that happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, do you remember the specific
bud that gave you that light bulb moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, you have to realize too,
that like names were fairly uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was a lot of weed on dead tour
that was like humble weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colton County organic outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it was sold as, you know,
kind bud, I got the nuggets, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because instead of being compressed,
it was like nicely shaped nugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, I don't really remember what
it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remember that it was green and
stinky and not compressed and seedless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and even to jump forward a second when
I was 22 or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that when I first moved to Mendocino
County, most weed around here was named
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of getting like a specific strain,
you would be like, Oh, this is some
[SPEAKER_00]: Panther gap weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some weed from white thorn.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some older point lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is some weed that I got up on Spyrock
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more like location based than even
the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of it was grown from seed and
most of it was mixed phenos in pounds or
[SPEAKER_00]: in ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it wasn't like it was mono cropped
like it is today with like most people
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't growing cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people maybe indoor they were growing
cuttings, but most outdoor and greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff was from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it'd be you might have five or six
different kinds of weed in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, maybe they were sisters to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't like you had like wildly
different strains mixed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like somebody would grow a batch of
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would trim it up and they would
weigh it up and then they would move it
[SPEAKER_00]: all along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my early experience was like,
you know, kind of was seedless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of wasn't compressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of tasted really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know what I didn't know
anything, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got out of high school and I bought
Mel Frank and Ed Rosenthal's book,
[SPEAKER_00]: Marijuana Horticulture, and I bought
marijuana bought me from Rob Clark and I
[SPEAKER_00]: bought what was the third one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge Cervantes book that he still puts
out the indoor marijuana Horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other than that and a little bit of
advice from some older hippies that I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally at shows or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of how I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one light on a mover, a four by
tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a buddy of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's passed away now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say his name, Johnny Winters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was probably about eight or nine
years older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was way into the Grateful Dead,
widespread panic, various things of that
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was definitely a tour rat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had a house in Carbondale,
Illinois, and he gave me these cuttings
[SPEAKER_00]: called the crystal chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the very first, you know,
I grew one thousand watt light on a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six foot mover over a four by tray of
crystal chunk when I was probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer of 1994.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first that was the first
time I ever actually the first time I ever
[SPEAKER_00]: grew weed, to be honest, is I used to sit
in my parents' house and D seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had to D seed and D stem the
Mexican weed that I was buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would D seed it and then I would
flick the seeds and stems out my window
[SPEAKER_00]: into the bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was my job to mow the family lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one time in spring, I'm out there in
Chicago and I'm mowing the lawn and I come
[SPEAKER_00]: upon these bushes and there's like three
foot tall pop plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've been I've been throwing
hundreds of seeds out my window for
[SPEAKER_00]: however many months, you know,
and then it got warm and some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember like running them over with
my lawnmower because I was so panicked I
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to get busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first time I ever grew,
it was on accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as I saw them,
I intentionally killed them because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to go over well at my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another point maybe I should
make, too, is that like some people grew
[SPEAKER_00]: up in a friendly weed environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents didn't smoke at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I needed to get away with smoking,
it had to be completely hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to take the dog on a walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe I had to bring some like,
you know, some gum or something to like
[SPEAKER_00]: take it off my breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to take a bunch of steps in order to
get away with it, because my parents are
[SPEAKER_00]: cool, you know, but they just weren't they
weren't weed people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't, you know, we lived in a
police state at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a teenager, it all had to be
totally clandestine.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, you're taking me back now when you
say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it, you know, and it makes me think
maybe, you know, the dog walker should
[SPEAKER_01]: have been named after you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, you just needed to get out
like that's, you know, I got real
[SPEAKER_00]: religious my parents were all stoked on me
because when I was 16, 17, whatever in
[SPEAKER_00]: high school, I'd walk the dog religiously,
big long walks, you know, he's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: overweight, he needed to walk my parents
thought I was like really doing a big good
[SPEAKER_00]: deed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get a couple blocks away from the
family and I'd spark up my bowl and off we
[SPEAKER_00]: went right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, growing weed was was just a way
like I needed I could get weed if I went
[SPEAKER_00]: to dead shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I didn't go to a dead show,
there was some people I knew in Chicago
[SPEAKER_00]: that I could get weed from but only
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this this is going to make you laugh,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's say you knew somebody that had a
three lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person that bought that off that
person, they would go through and whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted to keep they would pick out of
like, say the three or four pounds they
[SPEAKER_00]: got, they would pick out the nicest pound
out of the three Nug by Nug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would sell the rest and then
your buddy would get it and he would do
[SPEAKER_00]: the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might only be like two people away
from the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything I got was a small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was so in demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That like didn't matter what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was 50 bucks an eighth,
100 bucks a quarter for anything better
[SPEAKER_00]: than Mexican.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was hard to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was it was hard to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's actually if if it
would have been prevalent around me,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it would have been easy to get and I
would have been had multiple plugs,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I would have had someone to teach me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned how to grow weed by reading
books over and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know anything about electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know anything about wiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know anything about air movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing in apartments in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to figure out a way to get to get
away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my Amsterdam trips were to begin
in 94.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went in 94.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went most years between 94 and 04 is
when I stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a good 10 year period,
most years we went once or twice a year on
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed buying trip and to party,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was where I knew, you know,
Dead Shows and Holland were where I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: to get good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just specifically when you went on
those seed hunting trips, are there any
[SPEAKER_01]: real memorable standout seeds,
like something that really impressed you
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe something that even lived on
until today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the I don't know if you've heard
me talk about or you've seen on my page
[SPEAKER_00]: what I post the what we call the Maui.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Maui we got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think it was 1990.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably 1994, 1994 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably 29 years old now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was gotten on a trip over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the best thing that I ever
personally popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of what I bought over there was Black
Domino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sadly did not live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got I got I got in trouble a couple of
times and it got lost once.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have not been able to find it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as like my personal seed pops
of going over there, probably my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I ever found from Holland Genetics
that I personally purchased was Black
[SPEAKER_00]: Black Domino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got it the first year it came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got it in like December of 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had just been released that fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found a killer one was really,
really potent taste of like black pepper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really enjoyable smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss it quite a bit, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was dumb, too, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have probably bought two or three
things and bought like 50 to 80 seeds of
[SPEAKER_00]: each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead, I'd bring home like 15 packs
of one or two of each of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have like 10 or 12 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or 15 seeds or eight seeds or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get like five girls and then
you don't find what you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was smarter and I was older,
if I was doing it today and that shit
[SPEAKER_00]: still existed, I'd be buying 50 to 80
seeds of each and probably only buying two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like coming home and giving myself 20
or 30 or 35 females to look through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hindsight's 2020 for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of that stuff, like back in
the day when we were first getting it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we killed all the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't make seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't occur to us at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the way that you did it is you
got seed and you picked out the best
[SPEAKER_00]: females and you killed everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, that's almost the perfect segue to
talk about the Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to resist the urge to jump
there and try to keep us in chronological
[SPEAKER_01]: order.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you remember what it was you were
first growing when you started growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, the very first weed I ever
got, it was a I actually it's really weird
[SPEAKER_00]: how the Internet works, but I reconnected
with someone who was friends with Johnny
[SPEAKER_00]: Winner back then and in that same group of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me that the crystal chunk is
some kind of he doesn't remember which
[SPEAKER_00]: one, but he said it's some kind of NL or
NL hybrid that they bought from the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: bank back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some seed, some old seeds of it
that are a friend gave me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have this clone anymore,
but that was the very first kind bud
[SPEAKER_00]: strain I ever grew was I grew a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a light of crystal chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then shortly after that, we did an
Amsterdam trip and we got some various
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started seed popping and we got the
Maui ended up popping up in our group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that obviously still exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that was that was kind of like
that was what we were going as far as like
[SPEAKER_00]: trading with other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, like two other people besides myself
knew I was even growing in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would like to keep it that crazy,
like to make sure that I didn't get in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would literally be at parties and I
would buy an eighth off my friend who I
[SPEAKER_00]: sold a pound to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way I did it in public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way a bunch of friends would see,
oh, this is why Francis, this is why not
[SPEAKER_00]: so has this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is this is this is why I saw
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bought a quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bought an eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, he's got the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if you do that in public,
I can't be the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bit of social engineering at its finest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I be buying it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the world that you came into where like
there's connectivity and there's people
[SPEAKER_00]: trading cuts and there's access to cuts
and all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was zero, my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we had our small little group of
friends that had that that like we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: the same age that had a few cuts and we
went to Amsterdam, we got some seed and
[SPEAKER_00]: then my buddy ended up moving to Colorado
and that sort of expanded things a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I got introduced to the
color, to what people call the cough,
[SPEAKER_00]: the wheelchair, the question mark,
the Hong Kong, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I moved out to Mendocino County,
which is a whole kind of crazy story in
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I moved out to Mendocino County in the
late 90s and then eventually stuff really
[SPEAKER_00]: started shifting for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up getting the super skunk and the
and the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started trading with various people in
Mendo and getting some different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like the journey that
began.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely preempted my next question,
which I'll was going to ask, which came
[SPEAKER_01]: first, meeting Staten Island or moving to
Mendocino?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you sort of answered it,
but my question still remains.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it like when you first moved to
Mendo?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it like were things big and popping
off or was it still like that old world
[SPEAKER_01]: vibe that like me and Gene talks about
where, you know, like there was just these
[SPEAKER_01]: old Afghans and NLs and like not too much
more was discussed beyond that because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was just good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of came into like me and Gene
and I chatted about it a bit, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I came out to Mendo in a really weird
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I've told this story
publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll I'll give kind of an abridged version
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had my partner and by partner,
I mean like my my ex, she got cancer when
[SPEAKER_00]: we were in our early 20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and back in Illinois, there is no like
I don't know what it's like in Australia,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is no like universal health
coverage here.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, there's zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much Darwin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you were to get into like an
accident and break your leg or you were to
[SPEAKER_00]: have some kind of crazy emergency,
they'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you need like dialysis or you need
chemo or something like that, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much out of luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in the situation where I was totally
in love with her and she was sick and I
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to figure out a way to help her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started hustling and doing all
these various things, trying to earn
[SPEAKER_00]: enough money that I could afford the
surgery she needed and the chemo that she
needed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chemo, I was like a grateful,
dead hippie dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like a million percent against
doing any kind of radiation or any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was absolutely convinced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was poison.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the doctor pulled me aside and he
was like, look, man, he goes, if you do
[SPEAKER_00]: this right now, she has probably like
probably a 90 percent chance of complete
[SPEAKER_00]: remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went home and I was like,
man, you know, 90 percent is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone tells you you have a 90 percent
chance of getting what you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you do this thing, you'd probably do
the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I we did the we did the chemo and it
worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was she went into remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if you know much about
women's sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was about a size seven when she
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was throwing up a whole bunch and she
couldn't keep food down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she was dropping weight like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she ended up being like a double zero
in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like she was just wasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was wasting away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went through every every
anti-nausea medicine known to man,
[SPEAKER_00]: all this different shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of it was working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this guy, this doctor this
oncologist that we had, he was like an old
[SPEAKER_00]: Roman Catholic Italian guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were obviously grateful dead
hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looks at me and he goes,
do you guys smoke weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was well, I smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, you know, we've tried
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe before she comes in and she does her
chemotherapy, you guys could smoke a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of weed because we've tried everything
else and nothing's really worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really supposed to say this,
but you know, I've heard a little bit that
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it can control nausea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so why don't you give it a shot?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would wake up and we would watch the
prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Barker and the price is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would smoke joints and pull bongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would get her hellaciously baked
before these chemo treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she stopped vomit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she started gaining weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was literally like it was literally
like a fucking miracle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like she went from a size seven down to a
double zero back up to a size five,
[SPEAKER_00]: all from weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is probably I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had some at this point, Jerry Garcia
had died and there was no more dead tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had friends that had ended up in
Mendocino County growing weed that I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: from a couple of friends that I knew from
dead tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in November of 96, my buddy called me
up and he said, dude, it's time for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: move.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, we just passed the first
medical marijuana law in the entire United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We voted and it went through it passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, there's only five things that
it covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is cancer and
chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, so you can come out here with
your lady and you can grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't put you in jail for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took a little time, but,
you know, in 97 or whatever, we pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much started shifting our life and
figuring stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we moved out the following year into
Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I got out here in a totally
random way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she went into remission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And got completely healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I loved it out here and she absolutely
hated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she wanted to move back to Chicago and
our relationship did not last.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she moved back to Illinois and I
stayed in California and Mendocino County
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've been here since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's weird about that is that at one
point Mendocino County had the most
[SPEAKER_00]: liberal and forward thinking cannabis laws
in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually part of the Sheriff's
Department's medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were vetted, her and I, through the
Department of Health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a Mendocino County Sheriff's
Department and Mendocino County Department
[SPEAKER_00]: of Health laminated membership card that
said I was allowed to carry up to two
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds on my person and I was allowed to
legally smoke cannabis and consume
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and grow it for our personal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were part of the pilot program that
they started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fast forward a number of years,
I was part of that program, I think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: until 04, the federal government
threatened to come in and take all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: records that Mendocino County had on who
was in their medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, our sheriff was so
hardcore, he canceled the program and
[SPEAKER_00]: burned the records so that the feds
couldn't have access to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was how I ended up in Mendocino
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you wanted to segue into the Mendo
perp story, it's got a pretty good tie to
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lead the way, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to quickly say what a
beautiful story of the benefits cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: can have for people battling cancer,
but please, please lead on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a friend of mine who was blowing
glass at a time when blowing glass was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty lucrative and mostly only hippies
knew how to do it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was trying to set up an actual real
glass studio in his shop that he had on
[SPEAKER_00]: his property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you got to realize at the time,
a lot of the early glass blowers actually
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up damaging their lungs,
fuming gold and silver, and not realizing
[SPEAKER_00]: that they needed to have proper
ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ended up breathing in heavy metals
and doing some damage to themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he wanted to build basically this
HVAC system that would pull a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of air away from the station that
he was working and not toxify him,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So he hires this guy who is a retired HVAC
guy, and he ended up being sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was kind of going through the
same thing my ex was going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I felt really bad for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up giving him a chunk of water
hash and I don't know, two, three ounces
[SPEAKER_00]: of weed or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had, and I was like, I just hope
this helps you the way it helped my lady,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, man, I can't afford this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't honestly,
I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just have it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're helping us do this HVAC thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're struggling for your health and your
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, take a little hash, take,
take some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he felt embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, just just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if it helps you, it helps you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need zero from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fast forward a week and he goes,
man, you know, I used to grow back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, but I haven't done it in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was digging in my closet and I found
this little thing of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought maybe this is a way,
maybe you'd accept this as payment if you
[SPEAKER_00]: won't take any money or any work or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he gave me two seats and I sprout
these things up and they both pop and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: growing them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one ends up being a girl and one ends
up being a boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was having a friend of mine back
then, mostly we grew in bedrooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty clandestine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're growing in this bedroom and I'm
having a friend of mine helped me set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom because I had a three bedroom
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: One room was veg and one room was,
was flour, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I had him help me hang up all
these, these lights in this room and set
[SPEAKER_00]: up this veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get this veg set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I move all my plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in there the next morning and one of
the lights and you know, the old school
[SPEAKER_00]: metal sharp hood, one of the lights he had
put one of the, one of the wood hooks into
[SPEAKER_00]: the ceiling, but it had only gone in the
drywall.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd missed the stud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the night went on, it fell out of
the thing and it swung down and it chopped
[SPEAKER_00]: the mail off at the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just laying there on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, Oh man, well at least they,
I'm like in my mind, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least they killed the boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had this one girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I blew him this girl out and you got to
realize this is the late nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is way before Urkel or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of a sudden I get this like
crazy smelling Royal purple looking
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and I am tripping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen anything quite like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I take it to dude and I'm like,
is this what you, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looks at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, man, I didn't think that even
existed still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, but the only time I grew purple
weed was like the summer of 77 in Kovalo,
[SPEAKER_00]: which Kovalo is a little remote town in
Mendocino County, tucked away in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of nowhere.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seeds were basically 20,
21 year old seeds that he had just tossed
[SPEAKER_00]: in a cold closet in Leightonville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ignored and he died that following
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never really got more information off
it besides that, but that is literally how
[SPEAKER_00]: the way I got the Mendo perps is I gave a
cancer patient some hash and some weed to
[SPEAKER_00]: help them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gifted me back a couple of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I got the perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an incredible sort of real organic
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just someone helping another
person out and the universe rewards you
[SPEAKER_01]: for that indirectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have any idea it would go on to
become what it is now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I have to preface this by
acknowledging, I think Mendo perps is
[SPEAKER_01]: still kind of coming into its prime,
especially with all the work Caleb's been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's even still like, it's not
like, oh, it was big and it fell off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's still gaining momentum,
but what's your perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that as a part of the reason
why, when you talk to people, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the stories are so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't always line up is a lot of
times it was young kids that had no idea
[SPEAKER_00]: that anything that they were doing was
ever going to be talked about or be
[SPEAKER_00]: important again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, think about, think about for a
second, think about a chem dog popping the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem 91 when he was 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hugely unmemorable in the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, and that's part of why
some of the stories with sour diesel or
[SPEAKER_00]: with Kush, or with chem dog or with
whatever gets so convoluted is because
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody knew that they needed to be,
that they were going to be asked on a
[SPEAKER_00]: granular level what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, no, I didn't, I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, um, I knew it was special
because at the time I had never seen
[SPEAKER_00]: purple weed before like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like there was no purple weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of Afghans and Mendo and
stuff like that, that, um, will turn
[SPEAKER_00]: purple in the cold, especially,
you know, you get some, a cold snap and
[SPEAKER_00]: fall is there ripening or something like
that and they'll purple right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, at least in my experience,
in my realm, um, that was the first thing
[SPEAKER_00]: I ever grew that like in a 75 degree
indoor room would just turn dark purple
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just smelled wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, we loved it and I passed it
around to good friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a crazy story how CSI got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because, you know, but I'd let him
tell that aspect of it, but it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was, it, it's, I think it was sort of,
it was pre purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was pre pre, um, the perp,
the first purple wave that really got
[SPEAKER_00]: popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it only spread out so far,
but we did make some hybrids with it and
[SPEAKER_00]: those hybrids that we made, um,
one of them was intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: We crossed, um, this Durbin poison line we
had to, uh, the Mendo P and called it
[SPEAKER_00]: anis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it smelled very much like
licorice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that has gone on to make a number
of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, I had this strain called the
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: E F E F E X and I got it actually,
you know, I'm sure you know who Tim Blake
[SPEAKER_00]: is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Tim Blake is actually the first person
that ever showed me a 90 lighter,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, way back when, and I became friends
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to go to his house and he'd throw
like, he'd throw events at his,
[SPEAKER_00]: at his spa and he'd have music and food
and you know, they pound music all night
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a good time and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his worker gave me this cut that,
that some people called garlic bud and
[SPEAKER_00]: some people called effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was growing a room at my friend's
house, um, that had effects right next to
[SPEAKER_00]: some Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, uh, air conditioner went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a couple of days to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that amount of time, the Mendo perps
hermed, it hermed all over the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a bunch of purple effect seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that was, that was my first
feminized breeding, totally on accident,
[SPEAKER_00]: not, not intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that strain actually, you can see
it, I think it's in the second can of
[SPEAKER_00]: Bible, uh, purple effects and it's gone
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a number of modern strains today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's in the Sprite, it's in the Rose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's in a few different things that
people have used over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't have it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it and the seeds in a bust,
but it percolates around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, that's a really cool story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and could you ever have imagined that
like, you know, the Mendo perp was what
[SPEAKER_01]: led the way for these things, plus a
plethora of other strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, I know that on Breed of
Syndicate, I mentioned that, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the Mendo breath was one that I
feel like I see a lot of the Mendo perps
[SPEAKER_01]: within that strain, even though there's a
few generations removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you imagine that like, not only
might it be used in things, but even
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple generations later, you can still
really sort of see it shining through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and the reason is, is that the one
thing that, um, makes me think that my,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the guy was telling me the truth,
okay, is think about 1977.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would have been, um, like I was
saying earlier in the show, that was sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of like the first couple of years that
Afghans were started to make their way
[SPEAKER_00]: into Humboldt and Mendocino County and
spreading out a bit amongst the grower
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason why I think it could
possibly be true is that it's pretty low
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, but it's very, it's very much within
the range of what most things THC wise
[SPEAKER_00]: were in that era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's got a very, when you S one
it, when a CSI is S one did, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got an extremely wide gene pool in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not narrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very broad lots and lots of different
things pop out in those S ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, much more broad than most strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got, I don't want to say it's got
unique Terps because I don't think there
[SPEAKER_00]: is unique things in cannabis, but I do
think that it might be unique to what we
[SPEAKER_00]: know today in the sense that almost
anything I've ever smelled that smells
[SPEAKER_00]: like Mendo perps, I find that it ties back
to Mendo in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that Mendo is probably a
better breeder than it is as an actual
[SPEAKER_00]: plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's children, um,
or even some of its S ones can be nicer
[SPEAKER_00]: than the mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the mother plant, but it's got some
things I really adore, but it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: missing a couple of things that I wish it
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, it, it, uh, and there's
a weird thing where people don't like to
[SPEAKER_00]: give credit, you know, like you were
saying before everyone wants to walk out
[SPEAKER_00]: with their strain and have it be like it,
it create, and it, it, I created this out
[SPEAKER_00]: of nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can understand how a bunch of people
don't want to give up their secret sauce,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what I do think is cool is that,
uh, way beyond anything that I had to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, the biggest contribution you can
make in cannabis is to get some hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: out there or to get some crosses out there
or to get some seed pops that you happen
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a part of out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that those things are valuable enough
that other people, most of which don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even know you or might not even know that
you exist, find valuable enough in that
[SPEAKER_00]: weed to keep breeding and growing and
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I always try to mention to
people, you know, I think there's nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: more, you know, there's nothing more to be
grateful for as a breeder than when
[SPEAKER_01]: someone dedicates some space and time in
their grow to growing your workout,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if it's multiple times,
you know, it's, it's a real testament.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, think about like, you know,
when people, when you were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: how people get mad that people steal their
work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it's worse is,
uh, everyone's saying, man, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would never work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a compliment to have someone
to have someone use your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's even a bigger compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they like it so much, they want to
obscure where it comes from and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: and make up their own story about it
because it's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to, they, they want that like
rep or whatever that comes with it to like
[SPEAKER_00]: come to them instead of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, everyone's going to be forgotten,
dude, you know, like we're all just
[SPEAKER_00]: passing through a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, 20, 30 years from now,
like you were talking about, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what do you think strains will
be remembered?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully some of the breeders now are
making good enough work that some of their
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff still exists, or at least as blended
into the modern stuff that exists then.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the goal of breeding,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is like to leave a genetic imprint and to
maybe improve what you found in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pass it on to the next group.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in 20 years, we'll still have
rainbow belts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fletcher gave you a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's entirely possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even, you know, I don't even like
cookies very much, but it's certainly,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it's certainly a big part of,
uh, and a permanent part of the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say this too, like you were
talking about Caleb and his, and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the time Caleb told me when,
when he meets people that are actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: originator of whatever strain that they're
using, he's using, they get upset at him
[SPEAKER_00]: and they want some kind of compensation or
they want some kind of shout out or they
[SPEAKER_00]: want rep because he's using their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I was like the only guy that was
like just super stoked that, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: he was doing all these really cool things
with the Mendo P. Because I do think that
[SPEAKER_00]: no one is more, is going to be more
responsible for making sure that those
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics don't get lost than him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's made more hybrids with it and he's
popular enough that so many of those
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids have sold and he's made a bunch of
S ones and he's made it so that even if
[SPEAKER_00]: him and I or somebody else lost the mother
cut, that it's probably a permanent
[SPEAKER_00]: addition to the gene pool because it's
been mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been mixed into enough things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to survive in some form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a great way to view it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I, I wanted to just quickly loop
back to the other thing we mentioned a few
[SPEAKER_01]: questions ago, which was, you know,
you said you moved to Mendo and then
[SPEAKER_01]: shortly after you met Staten Island and
you got exposed to the dog and the super
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: How was it exactly that you met Staten
Island and when you did meet him,
[SPEAKER_01]: was he already in the thick of like the
chem 91 and the super skunk fandom,
[SPEAKER_01]: or was it still like he'd only just sort
of got them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where was it when you sort of stepped
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, I would so, you know,
Memories vary on this one a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it seems like, um, it seems like he
got both, let's say sometime in 1994.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then he brought them back to
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it seems like, um, skunk VA was still
traveling with the grateful dead then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he didn't start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think until after Jerry died in
August of 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like, um, you could ask him,
I suppose, but it seems like after Jerry
[SPEAKER_00]: died, he, I believe he quit touring right
away because there was no more tour and he
[SPEAKER_00]: came out, um, and get, and, uh,
Staten gave him, um, some super skunk and
[SPEAKER_00]: he started growing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe those Polaroids that he
posts on his page are from those very
[SPEAKER_00]: first few grows that he ever did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think, um, I want to say that
maybe he got it from Staten Island and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 95, uh, late 95, maybe early 96.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I see collective,
uh, graduated high school in 97 and he
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up moving in with skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, I think he got access to
it, um, by that aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got it the following year from
Staten Island, um, in 1998 and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, we just met randomly and, um,
smoked each other's weed and really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ended up going down and having
some dinners at his house.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lived in Sonoma County at the time,
um, with his, with his lady that became
[SPEAKER_00]: his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and we just ended up, we just ended up
becoming really good, close friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he, he was a stickler and he,
um, really was very intent upon none of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things ever leaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but for whatever reason, and he
decided to give them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I got the skunk and the,
uh, and the chem dog from him and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I've had the chem dog since I had the
skunk for a number of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, maybe nine years,
eight, eight, nine years after that,
[SPEAKER_00]: something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I got, I got in trouble and,
uh, they got cut down and I was the last
[SPEAKER_00]: person I knew that had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say that there was zero fame
around those cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was nothing of the legend that
you guys know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing of the, like,
I think that, uh, I don't think that they
[SPEAKER_00]: even started getting popularized very much
until skunk VA went on the forums and Oh
[SPEAKER_00]: six, maybe, or maybe it was Oh five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but for the first, I don't know,
half a decade, I had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it was just like some super fire weed
that we had and, uh, Staten Island
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't let me get, wouldn't let me give
it to anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody else could have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, that's, that's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most of the stories that I believe
are the ones that I heard earliest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because obviously there's,
you know, you know, fame gets into it and
[SPEAKER_00]: different people get into it and people
start arguing about time and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I, I came up,
you know, do I know it's origin stories a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred percent, you know, there's
obviously some debate back and forth on
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but I got it pretty early from
Staten Island, um, just by being good
[SPEAKER_00]: friends with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole super dog project was,
um, also just something that happened
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was good friends with him and
him and I were doing some stuff together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, that whole,
the whole like beginning of that really
[SPEAKER_00]: was that I don't think this is
particularly well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it is, maybe it's not, but after
Staten had given the skunk to,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, to chem dog on the East coast and then
brought the skunk and the chem and the dog
[SPEAKER_00]: out West, um, chem dog called them later
and said, dude, the first time I grew this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, it hermed the skunk hermed all over
the chem dog and I got seeds and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: growing those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're better than both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole start of his idea to like
create the super dog was basically trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to combine those strains into one line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to remember back then that was
so long before there was reversals or we
[SPEAKER_00]: even knew that reversals existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to like even make the line
happen, it was like, you had to BX,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's almost like you had,
you had to get a pollen source somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: because the two clones that we wanted to
cross were both girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had a single clone of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew nothing about reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew in fact, back then we thought that
hermaphroditic seed was cheating and it
[SPEAKER_00]: would fuck up your seed line by making
more hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we didn't know anything about
reversals or feminized breeding or any of
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he ended up taking the super skunk and
he ended up crossing it, um, to a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think we took that,
I think he took that to F3, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, selecting for, uh, skunk traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I believe if I remember
correctly, um, we might, it might,
[SPEAKER_00]: there might've been a, a backcross of that
back onto the, the skunk cut itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then pollen from that, got thrown on
the dog and that became super dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know there was that out crossing
step, but I'd love to ask you whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: happened to the super dog, because you
know, like we, we spoke to skunk BA
[SPEAKER_01]: recently and he also sort of had fond
memories of the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it got me wondering, like,
was there any specific reason no one held
[SPEAKER_01]: onto a cut or anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a bunch of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said before, 99% of people won't
hold a cut unless it's currently popular.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people, plenty of people held it and
plenty of people grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people just didn't hold it for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, there was as far as
gosh, this gets kind of tricky,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll just say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I gave all that stuff I gave to
Mandelbrot, which was basically a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: super dog and then a bunch of super dog
hybrids that Staten Island and I had made
[SPEAKER_00]: Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, the final stage of super dog that
we did was we took seven or eight males
[SPEAKER_00]: combined with our favorite females of
super dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there was seven and seven,
seven and seven of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put those in a room and then we put it
in there with like every single cut of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality cannabis that we had at the time,
which was Mendo perps, super skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: the dog, um, black, black Domina,
the warlock, um, the Maui, all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put them, we put everything,
every good cutting we had, we threw it in
[SPEAKER_00]: there on an eight lighter and we just let
the pollen fly and we just pollinated
[SPEAKER_00]: eight lights, which is using, making
regular seed with copious amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen is a ginormous amount of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that we had a ton, we had a ton
of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a bunch to Mandelbrot and the only
thing that I asked was that if he found
[SPEAKER_00]: anything cool, give it back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if anything ever happened and I needed
it, give it back to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and neither one of those two things
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, the Mandelbrot story, I don't
really want to get into detail too much
[SPEAKER_00]: about all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's a little, I just, you know,
he was my buddy and we had, we had some
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some issues over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that, you know, he had a little
ego that went to his head and he didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to share and he didn't want to admit
where some of it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we had kind of a falling out over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we met randomly and you Kaya,
we bumped into each other and we kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: had a heart to heart about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me he was going to give me
back, um, some, some selections he had
[SPEAKER_00]: made and he'd give me back some seed and
we were going to be all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with, before that actually
happened within a couple of months,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, he unexpectedly passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, when he passed away, um,
I don't know exactly what happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it seems like people went into his
grow room and people went into his seed
[SPEAKER_00]: stock and a lot of that stuff disappeared,
put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then that left me and Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: We each had a bunch of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, I had jogging.
Jogging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a bunch of mason jars and jars
and jars, like mason jars full of hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had it stashed in a couple of
different places in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was in early Oh nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got rated and, uh, they took all my seed
and they actually flushed it down the
[SPEAKER_00]: toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't usually tell that story very much,
but I got handcuffed to a computer chair
[SPEAKER_00]: and they wheeled me in front of the
bathroom and then they took all these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and they opened up each mason jar
and they poured it into the toilet while
[SPEAKER_00]: they were waiting for the paddy wagon and
they flushed all the seed down the toilet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus, what's that death by torture?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then shittily right in that same
time period, Staten Island went on
[SPEAKER_00]: vacation and he had all of his seeds
stored in a fridge in his garage and
[SPEAKER_00]: someone had plugged something else into an
outlet and it popped the outlet while he
[SPEAKER_00]: was on vacation and so the fridge stopped
working and they ended up, the whole time
[SPEAKER_00]: he was on vacation, which I think was two
or three weeks, they ended up in a 115
[SPEAKER_00]: degree garage unrefrigerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, RIP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he had jars and jars of seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried all these different ways to make
them pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wouldn't pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We passed them to friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did all this stuff about scuffing them
and soaking them and peroxiding them,
[SPEAKER_00]: seed cracking them and every once in a
while we'd get like a tail that would pop
[SPEAKER_00]: out and then it would just not continue
and die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually had all that seed,
thousands and thousands of seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we just couldn't make anything happen
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2017, we had those massive
California fires and his house burned
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we lost him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an Emerald Mountain legacy,
Ben, who is a Mandelbrot's younger
[SPEAKER_00]: brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has some stuff that has like some of
that stuff worked in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if out there, you know,
supposedly there's a cut called the truth
[SPEAKER_00]: that is Superdog by Maui that exists that
I haven't grown, but it's a selection that
[SPEAKER_00]: Mandelbrot made out of Superdog by Maui
seeds that I gave him that exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look in the second Canna Bible,
the red one, there's a bunch of pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Superdog, Superdog seven,
Superdog three, some of the Finos I
[SPEAKER_00]: selected, but yeah, four or five years of
work through busts, cops, fire and popping
[SPEAKER_00]: circuits, we lost the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's, that's heartbreaking to hear,
but you know, sort of speaking to your
[SPEAKER_01]: point earlier, you know, nothing more of
an honor than to have someone want to use
[SPEAKER_01]: your work, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, you know, you get something
that reminds you of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to ask while I got you here,
what do you think is the lineage on the
[SPEAKER_01]: chem dog, you know, the much speculated
and guessed at, do you have any ideas
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's, I might get in trouble
for saying this, but this is kind of how I
[SPEAKER_00]: see it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Joe B and Peabud were older cats and
they were on dead tour and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: buying and selling weed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very common for people to buy weed,
say a half pound, a quarter pound,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple pounds, take it on dead tour and
sell it in chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what paid for their tickets and
their life and their partying and having a
[SPEAKER_00]: good time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys are buying and selling weed
all the time on dead tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: They buy weed, they give it to,
they, they sell a bunch of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some of it goes to a 17 year old kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's in 1991, Peabud and Joe B
don't figure out that anything came of
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds until the forum era,
05, 06.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally 15 years goes by without them
having anything to do with the chem story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're asked, Hey, do you
remember 15 or 16 years ago, that one week
[SPEAKER_00]: when you were in Indiana, do you remember
what the weed was like that you had and
[SPEAKER_00]: that you were buying and selling then?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big ask for a nonmemorable event,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it was like, it was one,
it was like, not only was a nonmemorable
[SPEAKER_00]: event, but like they didn't even realize
that anything came of it for a decade and
[SPEAKER_00]: a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've, I definitely, I've heard
people talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even want to say some of the
rumors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, um, I think that we just
won't ever know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I have a bunch of theories about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some people get mad at me for talking
about the theories because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the chem D and the chem dog and then
the one through the four and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things that are all supposed to
be from the same exact seeds, which
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone assumes that they're sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if in that ounce, there was,
like I was talking about before,
[SPEAKER_00]: what if there was multiple phenos in that
ounce?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've always thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if some of them were hybrids and some
of them were S ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if there was even more than one
source of pollen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that we know that gave dude
the weed, they weren't even the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were middlemen buying weed from
someone and then taking it on dead tour
[SPEAKER_00]: and parceling it out to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I will say is that I do think that
um, just by growing it for a long time and
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing it to a bunch of stuff and seeing
it, I do think that the Mendo or I do
[SPEAKER_00]: think that the, the, the chem 91,
I think it's already an S one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that way, like when Caleb or
somebody like that, when you, when you S
[SPEAKER_00]: one it, I think part of the reason why it
looks so uniform and there's like not very
[SPEAKER_00]: much variation going on there at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it's already an S two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just cause like the results, the progeny
give just because of how narrow,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if you were like, remember how I was
talking about how I thought like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Mendo P might be land race because
when you S wanted it so wide, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you see so many different expressions
and size and colors and nose and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things, the chem 91 is the
opposite of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all of it looks extremely similar
to the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very little physical, there's some
potency differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually some S ones that are even
more potent than the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that strain, uh, CSI has told me he
thinks that nothing in his entire
[SPEAKER_00]: collection passes on potency as
consistently as that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it, but it just kind of is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you try to go through a bunch of
S ones, you're not going to find a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of wildly different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've certainly heard you guys
mentioned that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've used that in some of the seed
selections I'm making, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I thought to myself, all right,
if the 91 really consistently passes on
[SPEAKER_01]: potency, maybe I should try to get crosses
where the other parent is like really
[SPEAKER_01]: terpy or something, because like,
if it's going to pretty consistently bring
[SPEAKER_01]: potency, maybe like a, a forbidden fruit
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem 91 is sort of like the go-to,
you know, in terms of getting like a nice,
[SPEAKER_01]: well-rounded sort of plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that is real breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I think happens in breeding today
is people try to take two things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: already popular, but you probably don't
have access to and combine them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get hybrids of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, real breeding is like,
there's these qualities in this one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's these qualities in this other
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder if I can get them in the same
plant by making, making seeds with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get these, can I get these qualities
from over here and these qualities from
[SPEAKER_00]: over here and can they combine?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me is breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, anything you wanted to add
potency to, you know, the 91 will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it also, you know, at its look
too, you know, which is, like that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: that old dark olive dinosaur looking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite strains still.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well stood up to the test of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has probably my favorite Indica high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I adore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everyone thinks it's a favorite,
but I personally love it a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to quickly ask you before I
forget, cause it's like a fleeting moment,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when we spoke to SkunkVA recently,
he mentioned that there was this cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: that went around sort of in the 2000s,
it was a super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, oh man, it went around
the Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was actually pretty memorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish we still had that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever get exposed to that one
slash?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on the super silver
haze in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like super silver haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, super silver haze and Neville's
opinion was kind of an improved Jack
[SPEAKER_00]: Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a blend of haze skunk and
Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, in that regard,
there's a lot of variation in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on which ones I had one,
I lost it in the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one that was, you can still see some
pictures of it on my page that I loved a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it was like elite,
elite, elite, but it was really nice weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smelled really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It threw chunks all over itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked the mango haze line a little
better, but it's one of those ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: you might have to look through a lot to
find what you really adore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's in there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes, you know, you can look as
much as you want and you won't find what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it's easy to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it takes work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the super silver haze that are
really good takes work, but they exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, there's, there's various
phenos of it that float around that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think are quite nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome to hear that you,
you know, got a soft spot for the mango
[SPEAKER_01]: haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one that, you know, it's actually
very popular in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the older dudes really vibe on it
and haven't really seen it represented as
[SPEAKER_01]: much in the States outside of,
what's his name?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Mango, the guy from Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, really stoked, stoked,
stoked to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, mango haze and super silver haze
are sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, super silver haze is C5 crossed to a
skunk haze.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mango haze is a sister of that C5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville called it the 122 crossed to the
same dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they share, so mango haze and super
silver haze share the same father and the
[SPEAKER_00]: mothers are full sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they're very closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very closely related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that they actually called the
122, the mango in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of its nicknames,
um, because it had that mercy and it had
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those turps that were,
that were like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I actually, if I had to pick,
um, super silver haze tends to be much
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a commercial plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like got that, those skunk colas all
over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It yields really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mango haze is a little hazier to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little more sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little more finicky, but I tend to
like the weed better, um, than super
[SPEAKER_00]: silver haze on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, you know, and I think it might be
one of the ones from, um, from Shanti's,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Shanti's company, Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be one of the ones that he
actually still has the real parents of,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is always a big debate, but,
uh, I like mango haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, while we're on the topic of,
uh, seeds and what parents might be in
[SPEAKER_01]: them, I want to ask you, you know,
sort of a two-parter, but we'll keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: simple to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, there's been speculation in,
you know, the community for a while,
[SPEAKER_01]: but more recently, you know, Matt chucked
up the post, which, um, sort of openly
[SPEAKER_01]: said that the ChemD may be a Chem 91 cross
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love to hear your thoughts on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there might be any merit to
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I'm one of the proponents of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it caused some battles,
uh, with various, various people that did
[SPEAKER_00]: not like said speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's speculation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what's the harm in speculating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the reason why I think so is that,
you know, um, the, uh, I just see like
[SPEAKER_00]: having grown the Chem 91 for a really long
time now and having a, a pretty long
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with the skunk before I lost
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I personally just see both parents
in that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, like we were mentioning
about how narrow banded that Chem 91 S
[SPEAKER_00]: ones are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, it's also possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, uh, JJ and I got into a battle
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, well, could it be,
you know, he's like, let's say that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you say is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why couldn't it be CIS by S by super
skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to admit that that could be true
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't see that the Chem 91,
the ChemD, the Chem four, um, the Chem one
[SPEAKER_00]: that still exists, some of these different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't see them as being able to
have the same exact mom and dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whether that means that like,
dude, it's all true and it's the same
[SPEAKER_00]: original 13 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was like mixed phenos of actual
females in that ounce that he had,
[SPEAKER_00]: or there was multiple pollen sources or
some of the other chems are later hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, I'm not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any super insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it is, I, I think that,
um, I think that the ChemD is a chem
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, the way, how green it is,
the way it grows, the way it smells,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way it herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've just grown it a whole bunch and
that would be my guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hoped that phylos or some of these
other genetic offerings that people have
[SPEAKER_00]: done would have started to unlock some of
these oral histories and some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: legends and tales that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like been definitive, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they can be like, this is
absolutely, a full sister or this isn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have verifiable proof one way
or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have, you know, a story about a
teenager starting some seeds and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's all we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally can understand your point of
view and that there's so much ambiguity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to really say for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something that I was thinking about
myself is that a comment that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: lasted with me was when SkunkVA said,
none of the super dogs came out like
[SPEAKER_01]: ChemD, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, why would I necessarily believe
that that's the lineage?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then what I thought was, if you look
at the GMO, we know what the lineage is.
[SPEAKER_01]: ChemD cross cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mamiko has put out a bunch of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have popped them and no one has
found anything like the GMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thought, what if it's the same
with the ChemD and the skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just like a one in a
million pheno.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's kind of like the same thing
with CAP, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When he got famous on the Mac One and he
sold a ton of Mac One seeds and hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: and nothing came out looking like it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, Caleb and I have this thing
where like plants don't lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: People do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my stuff that I just told you is
just my guesses based on breeding with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, growing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing too is that you got to
remember when SkunkVA was talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: the super dog, when I kind of gave that
quick rundown of what happened with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the super dog was a pure
super skunk by ChemDog.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was steps involved, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we never actually like, you know,
maybe if we were doing it 10 years later,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would have just, you know, used some
STS or something and reversed one onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not how it happened,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know what, but here's the
thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that I have a theory and I'll just say
this, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like this, and this is where like
talking about history gets really delicate
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, you try to tell history
and there's history and there's known and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's unknown and there's people that
get attached to certain stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I start talking about this and then
people are going to be like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: people are, people are saying,
you know, Francis Knotsodog is saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: like, that Greg is a liar, that it's that,
that I don't believe his story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, ChemDog, two of my all time
favorite plants, the Chem91 and the ChemD
[SPEAKER_00]: came out of either, you know, his room or
his efforts, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm amazingly grateful for that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also got to remember and think
back to your own experiences, say he pops
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff when he's 17.
[SPEAKER_00]: How on it were you between 17 and 22,
23?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like not very honored at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not very honored at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so could he honestly believe that it's
all the same 13 seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could they be?
[SPEAKER_00]: They could, but I have a hard time
believing it unless there's multiple moms
[SPEAKER_00]: and dads involved, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, there's also like,
there's some ChemD fakes out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what caused its own whole set of
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've battled with people on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if we really want to get
into that on this thing, but the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with the ChemD fakes is that they all seem
to originate from Greg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've had this thought that it's
possible that some of those seeds were
[SPEAKER_00]: either, um, you remember how I told you
when we, the, for the whole first idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: the super dog was the super skunk
accidentally hermed on the chems and he
[SPEAKER_00]: was all excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if some of that stuff was just seed
from that accident?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if, what if it just ended up,
he had a box of different seeds and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of it got into a different labeling and he
thought it was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all supposition, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that the 91 and the one and
the four and the D are vastly different
[SPEAKER_00]: than one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I have to admit, I've always been a
bit uncomfortable about the one,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially it's just so left of field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, it, it, it, the, the way,
you know, and it's like the, the D is like
[SPEAKER_00]: a short stocky Afghan thing, you know,
that takes nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one and the four take 12 or 13 weeks
and are big, stretchy, long running colas
[SPEAKER_00]: that throw bats.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 91 is like this mutant, um,
old Afghan leafy looking thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they just have very, very different
looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their kids look very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I don't know that I'm not
sitting here saying anyone's wrong because
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that I'm right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying observationally,
I see things that make me question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, I, there's so much more I want
to ask you about this, but I think we'll,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll have to save it for a part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise we'll end up going down this
rabbit hole forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But while we're talking about the actual
lineage of things, I'm sure you've
[SPEAKER_01]: noticed, uh, Caleb's put up a post that
he's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: This F1 Durban reversal.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, do you suspect he's going
to find anything similar to cookies in the
[SPEAKER_01]: derb cross OG hybrids he's done?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, there's some interesting stuff
in all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that, that probably, if we want to
wrap this up in the next few minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep it pretty short and sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there, you know, he is,
uh, he has very different thoughts after,
[SPEAKER_00]: after doing it than he did in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I gave him the flow rider to use in
that, in that cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I got the flow right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only re the flow rider is an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be, you know, um, I don't know if
that's its first name or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's, it's, it's got name changed or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I do know is that the person that
the cookie accident happened, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the cush that he had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me directly in Oh four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I am absolutely convinced that
that's the cushion cookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I gave him, um, that cut so that he
could add it into the F1 derb room and we
[SPEAKER_00]: could see what, what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that cookie was a multi-stage
accident and, uh, I, um, we could talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about that, but that probably would have
to be a part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, that would might have to be a
part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, we're, we're definitely going to
have to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do want to be conscious of your time
because I've already taken up the best
[SPEAKER_01]: part of four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how about, uh, we do one more question
before we get onto the quick fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll, we'll definitely have to
do a part two, but questions specifically,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking about you and I was like,
Oh, this is actually a perfect one for not
[SPEAKER_01]: so dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, you know, when we think about
modern breeding, we have this sort of more
[SPEAKER_01]: analytical, more scientific approach these
days compared to in the past, when it was
[SPEAKER_01]: arguably a bit more intuitive,
you know, people were still using science,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, generally speaking,
education was less widespread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I think of that sort of breeding,
I think of people like DJ short.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if DJ short existed in
today's climate as a fledgling breeder and
[SPEAKER_01]: express some of the zany, some of the more
wacky ideas, at least by modern standards
[SPEAKER_01]: that he has in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there would, he would get a
reception or do you think he would be sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of laughing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it feels like we've come so far with
our understanding of genetics that maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: we might be at risk of losing some of the
more left of field ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thought?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to realize that most people
breeding or breeding for money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't really advanced all that far
in the sense that, and I, and I don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm painting a broad brush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's plenty, there's people out
there with passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people out there doing,
you know, micro breedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of their own stuff and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not trying to lump it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to talk about like the
commercial aspect of breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a particular moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're actually doing very
much in the way of breeding right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people like Fletcher or CSI
or different people doing some like
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-stage breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of the game is take this,
reverse it onto a bunch of well-known
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts, sell, and it's just a one-off and
that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So DJ is interesting in that if you
believe his story, he basically created
[SPEAKER_00]: everything out of four plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He had like an Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had like a, he had a couple different
kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a Oaxacan that he crossed to a,
to a tie that he called juicy fruit and he
[SPEAKER_00]: had an Oregon purple tie and that's
basically it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me, I don't think DJ has like a
bunch of different lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he has like one line that he's
pulled different expressions out of and
[SPEAKER_00]: then bred with those expressions,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and you know, I think he probably
bottleneck stuff accidentally early on
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, I think that the,
the, there's a lot of cool breeding that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not for sale, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people that are making things for
scale sale are like, okay, so I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take this lemon cherry gelato and I'm
going to cross it to skittles and then I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cross it back to thin mint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're trying to breed and even if
you're somebody doing experiments,
[SPEAKER_00]: like let's, let's talk about, uh,
CSI for a second again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does, you know, reproductions of,
you know, pine tar Kush or, or deep chunk
[SPEAKER_00]: or Burmese or these different things or
stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Erling skunk, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does open pollinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did the NL project.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does all that kind of stuff,
but that stuff's not as bread and butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like his bread and butter is like,
you know, Mendo P hybrids and skittles
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids and crossing this by this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has to make enough popular stuff,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: To fund the weird shit that might not have
too much commercial value, but still
[SPEAKER_00]: important to make seed of and half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember Bodhi expressing a similar
point saying a lot of the stuff he offers
[SPEAKER_01]: is not his true passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to pay the bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the side, he can do the
passion projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this might be a little good
segue, but are you familiar with the
[SPEAKER_00]: actor, Michael Kane?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I watched that you could probably watch
it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this, there's this thing that he
gave where he, he got this award and he
[SPEAKER_00]: gave this speech and it very much made me
feel like it was about breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it was about acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he basically said, look, when you're
young and you're an actor and you're poor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you take any work you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter how crappy it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just take it because you need a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you do a good job in those
things, maybe you get some bigger roles
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're still just taking whatever's on
offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, and then you get to a point
in life where maybe if you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: successful enough, you've got some
blockbusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some big hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can take a risk on a passion
project or something that really makes you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's like, then you have to balance
that with some big screen production
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're still trying to have a
career.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he goes, when you're in the movies,
maybe every once in a long while you get
[SPEAKER_00]: to really follow your passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: When mostly you're just trying to do good
work along the way and stay afloat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge parallels.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of what I was just
talking about is like, like you were
[SPEAKER_00]: saying with me talking to Bodhi or what I
was just mentioning about CSI is like in
[SPEAKER_00]: order for him to do these open
pollinations, in order for Bodhi to mess
[SPEAKER_00]: around with some like weird ass sativas,
he has to release some popular stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to pay the bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to blend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going out on a limb and making that that's
what's so cool about being a private
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder, dude, is you can literally do
whatever the fuck you want when you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to worry about making money off it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can have herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can not yield well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can have all these problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still you're still doing it for you
or your friends and you're going to look
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you find good weed, you're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to breed and you're
going to sell, right, then you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: take some commercial aspects of that into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so when you look at when you look
at people, right, like and I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to like I'm not trying to call anybody out
here by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you remember how I was speaking about
how a lot of famous people get into
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and they kind of breed with what
made them famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Norcal ICMAG breeds a lot with OGKB
because it made him famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Swamp Boys did a ton with TK
because that was kind of their bread and
[SPEAKER_00]: butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk V.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: stays pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty close to the chem family of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these aren't disses on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But imagine if Skunk V.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, hey, I got this weird Lawation
sativa from Bodhi and I got this other
[SPEAKER_00]: African thing and I'm going to start doing
these weird sativas that I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he puts in all this time and he puts
in all this money and he puts in all this
[SPEAKER_00]: effort and then it sells like shit and
he's stuck with like 10000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a commercial aspect to it,
right, where you're trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what and I can tie that back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like even if I'm not talking about
breeding, even if I'm just talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: like like preserving a large collection of
moms or something like that, you still
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do enough stuff that's
commercially viable that you can fund your
[SPEAKER_00]: passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's almost like, you know,
to be commercially successful,
[SPEAKER_01]: it almost forces you to stay in your own
lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It limits you and then you get known.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, like take going back
into acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use another example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember watching Jackie Chan give an
interview on one of the stupid late night
[SPEAKER_00]: talk shows or something and they were
talking about, did he ever want to branch
[SPEAKER_00]: out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he looks right at the camera and he
goes, I would love to branch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, they want to see me do martial
arts and be funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to see me in a tender,
romantic, comedy with Jennifer Aniston.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would I do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want to cast me in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they want Hugh Grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want, you know, they want Fred Pitt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want Leonardo DiCaprio.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be in a buddy movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be in a martial arts movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can be in a comedy maybe, but I can't be
in a, in a, in a romance or a drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not where they want to cast me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think breeding has parallels to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you, you get known for what you're
known for and it's hard to branch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are going to branch out,
what happens if it's a total flop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, this perfect segue, this is why
we need to all give credit to Berner for
[SPEAKER_01]: casting Bodhi as the head of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's given Jackie Chan the role
in the dramatic thriller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I will say, you know, Bodhi was at
the party we just had, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that him and Berner trying to
collab, I don't know if it went well for
[SPEAKER_00]: either one of them, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different fan bases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I hope it transpires through,
you know, he said he's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get some cool stuff on their
menus and there's nothing more I'd love to
[SPEAKER_01]: see than for that to work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand why he did it and I don't
even disagree with his reasoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that like, for a lot of
Bodhi fans, they look at Berner and
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies as sort of the evil empire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, true, true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I guess I think of it as like,
I think his intentions are coming for what
[SPEAKER_01]: he hopes is best for the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, he's a sweet man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He absolutely, he's not, he's not thinking
of it in some kind of like selfish or
[SPEAKER_00]: negative light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mean that like, you know,
it's a good example of stepping out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your lane and he had a certain lane with
people and he, you know, he stepped out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it and it was probably stepping out with
Bodhi, but with, with Berner, but you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, those guys, they desperately need
people that are different breeders than,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, than they've been currently working
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have, Cookie themselves has stayed
way, way too much in their own little
[SPEAKER_00]: stream and it's way too inbred in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they definitely need to bring
people in that can widen that pool because
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've kind of gone anywhere you
could have possibly gone in that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiny little shallow in that shallow end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely can see where you're coming
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is another one where we
could, we could probably spend a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: hour talking about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll, we'll definitely touch back on
this one in part two, but we could,
[SPEAKER_00]: my phone is going to die too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like this four hours or whatever is
like, no, I'm at like 8%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're probably going to have to cut it
off regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's going to die and I'm not going
to be able to chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll, we'll shorten the final five to
the, the quick three then quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to know what's the most
memorable experience with cannabis you've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most memorable experience with
cannabis I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when I first realized how powerful
Hayes was, uh, I kept going out to
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam and I kind of thought their weed
was bunk compared to ours to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I met, uh, one of Neville's
friends who grew for him and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: sold the weed to the coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name's Steve and, um, I smoked some
Neville's Hayes, just a little pinner,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and by pinner for people that don't
know, it's just a skinny joint between me
[SPEAKER_00]: and my buddy who I went out there with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Steve, we smoked that joint and I felt
soaring high, psychedelic high,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was tripping high to the point
where, when I walked out of his flat as a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I was probably 24 then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or 26 then or something I like held onto
the railing so I could walk down the
[SPEAKER_00]: steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first time that I
realized that maybe some of those old
[SPEAKER_00]: timers talking about how like some of
those sativas had this like soaring
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic disassociative speedy high,
which I kind of thought they were lying
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized it could be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that Neville's Hayes cut
that still exists is very, very different
[SPEAKER_00]: than most weed that's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would put it up as one of my,
probably my most memorable weed
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to go hunt for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But onto the next question, which is I'm
going to drop you off on a desert Island
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can take three strains with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be packs of seeds if you want
to do some breeding or they could just be
[SPEAKER_01]: clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, somehow on this Island,
you've got the resources to grow them
[SPEAKER_01]: forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you taking with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm going to take the LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take the chem 91 and I'm
going to take an NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a nice balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not spreading yourself too thin in
one area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dig that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So final question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love to ask everyone, at least on their
first appearance, I've got a time machine
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go back anywhere, anytime,
any place, presumably to collect some
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, either cuttings or seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you going to go back to?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go probably to 1989 and I would
buy everything from super city for seed
[SPEAKER_00]: club and Neville seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely what I would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in line with the earlier answer,
I guess we'll, we'll try to grab like 50
[SPEAKER_01]: of each seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it would, it would be, it would be a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that, that in like 89 90 that
Neville literally sold 50 50 packs of
[SPEAKER_00]: maple leaf Indica, the same exact seed
batch that he found all of the phenols
[SPEAKER_00]: that he used to make super skunk and all
that other stuff with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called, you can look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in his book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called original Afghan mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just extra seed that he had
that, that Jim Ortega had given him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would absolutely go back to 89 or 90
and I would buy both of those companies a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would have real NL one, real NL two,
real NL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just all of that and just grow it out
and see it for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a one I'm definitely going to have
to consider for my own pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I ever find said time machine?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any general comments or shout
outs you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the only, the only general comments or
shout outs that I would make is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, to P if, if anyone out there
is thinking about breeding, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or S or saving clones or,
you know, don't do it based on anything
[SPEAKER_00]: more than like pick things that you love,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That you, that personally vibe well with
you, try to save a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to save everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to save a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can find some old and unpopular
stuff that maybe you care about a bunch,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody can pitch in a little bit and
this person can hold two or three here and
[SPEAKER_00]: this person can hold five and this person
can hold one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every little bit that you hold of that
eighties or nineties or early two
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands era is a gem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're going to get into
breeding, um, try to, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to find two plants or two lines that
you have an idea that you could get both
[SPEAKER_00]: traits into the same line and breed for
what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's not enough of breeding for
what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's breeding for what other people
might like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, breed for what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if nobody else likes it,
at least you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brilliant answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely some sentiments I can echo
myself, you know, coming from that passion
[SPEAKER_01]: side of things, it'll be much more likely
for you to be successful than if you just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, trying to slap two things
together that you think will sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again, a huge shout out to the
weed historian, weed librarian,
[SPEAKER_01]: originator of the Mendo perps,
one half of the breeders syndicate,
