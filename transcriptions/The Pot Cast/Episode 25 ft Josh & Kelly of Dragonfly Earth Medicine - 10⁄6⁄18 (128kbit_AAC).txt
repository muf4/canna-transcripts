[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, we're joined by the
amazing Josh and Kelly of Dragonfly Earth
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay tuned for all the knowledge bombs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, so a big thank you and welcome
to the dynamic duo, Josh and Kelly from
[SPEAKER_00]: Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for having us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for having us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first question I want to ask is,
what are you guys currently smoking on?
[SPEAKER_05]: A homesteader.
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually have a big jar of homesteader
here, which is one of our really long time
[SPEAKER_05]: strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's actually a cross of one of our
really long time strains.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's our Zellie's gift times our 840.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has a temple spice as a female.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been working with the Zellie's
gift for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a Jack Herrera mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a gooey mother clone that came from
Oregon, which is really, really awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: that we love forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we've been breeding up here for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do have a lot of other people's
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of wonderful, amazing people
that give us strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we really like ours because they're
really intelligent for our area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the homesteader is kind of an uplifting
kind of lemony.
[SPEAKER_05]: High in beta-cariophylline and has really
a beautiful full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabinoid profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is that got any CBD or anything
like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it a more THC dominant one?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's mostly THC dominant, but it's
probably a four to one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're guessing we go from seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would probably be maybe a 17% to 19%
THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're hoping for an 8% CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're starting to bring more CBD into our
THC varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they still have a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they have this dynamic
cannabinoid profile, which we really like
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're also breeding for the CBDV and
the CBDN.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're breeding for the cannabinoids we
don't know about yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's such an interesting point to
make because something I've always thought
[SPEAKER_00]: about kind of in my subconscious is what
if breeders began to embed just a small
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of CBD in the background of
profiles such that maybe people aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: aware that it's even there per se,
but just everyone's kind of enjoying that
[SPEAKER_00]: added medicinal effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that that's maybe something
that will come out more so in the future?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, trying to have as much CBDs in
there and still getting that nice high
[SPEAKER_05]: that people are looking for is totally
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been breeding in CBD from an ACDC
clone that we got a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have like a one to one and sort of
a two to one and a three to one and a four
[SPEAKER_05]: to one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're just continually trying to make
sure that that CBD makes an appearance in
[SPEAKER_05]: all of our new strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that there's kind of like the hemp
CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's the THC variety throwback
CBDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where some of the original CBDs
came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD plants and stuff like the Harlequin
and everything came from a THC variety
[SPEAKER_02]: that was thinking it might have had the
high CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, the tsunamis and the
sour tsunamis and everything got created
[SPEAKER_02]: after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're not breeding, if you have to
be careful with breeding into the hemp to
[SPEAKER_02]: try and get your CBD varieties,
when you find like a really flavorful,
[SPEAKER_02]: high CBD, that is easily breedable with
the THC varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: In our opinion, I think it's what along
the lines what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a real winner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we just sort of keep our hemp
breeding with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really see the difference between
medical and recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, we would love to just sneak
in whatever people consider medical into
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational because why not be medical
while you recreate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you touched on a few interesting points
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one, which jumps to mind,
though, is one thing I've heard commonly
[SPEAKER_00]: is that some strains, particularly the CBD
dominant ones, have this kind of general
[SPEAKER_00]: slash bland terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some people even refer to it as
like a cherry kind of profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you agree with that view?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you subscribe to that or do you
think maybe that's just a bit too
[SPEAKER_00]: nitpicky?
[SPEAKER_05]: We definitely see that more in the hemp
varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now we have lots of friends that are
in the industry that are starting to like
[SPEAKER_05]: pop like one million seeds and then
they're testing 10,000 of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of their number one things that
they're searching for is a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_05]: a terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's some new seeds out there in the
hemp world called a spectrum.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also one that's the cherry wine,
one that's called a number five that
[SPEAKER_05]: really has beautiful terpene sort of,
you know, all over the map.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yes, I do agree with you that sort of
the cherry was the first flavor to come up
[SPEAKER_05]: in the high CBD hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now that there's just more searching
out there and more testing, more terpene
[SPEAKER_05]: profiles are becoming apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so another question I wanted to ask
you is I've found a strain by I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: it's CBD crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, it's CBD seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Shanti Baba's company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, he says he's got a CBD
strain where instead of having any hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: being brought into it at any point,
he found a regular kind of you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC dominant strain, which happened to
have some CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over multiple generations
selectively bred it out like selectively
[SPEAKER_00]: bred the THC out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says the advantage of this is that you
don't get that hemp terp or and you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit better bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thought that I had was,
is that really an issue with you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like for example, when we look at the work
you're doing is the bud structure from the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp genetics, which maybe brought the CBD
many generations ago, is that still
[SPEAKER_00]: evident or is it just not even there
anymore, really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Still looks a lot like the hemp when you
get the hempy ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still has sort of that, you know,
smaller flower nodes, maybe even less of
[SPEAKER_05]: them on a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taller, thinner leaves, you know,
I mean, really, you know, I feel beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes and there's I know people that
are making oils out of it and even making
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's still, you know, there's still
profiles there to go with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, there's really there
really is kind of the hemp varieties and
[SPEAKER_02]: then the more broadly varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's broadly CBDs is basically what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in regards to kind of what I just
mentioned with that selectively bred out
[SPEAKER_00]: THC phenotype, would you be interested in
looking at something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does the advantages on paper not really
kind of seem like it's a worthwhile in
[SPEAKER_00]: exploration, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: We feel like breeding out the THC,
you know, more and what is called the drug
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivar cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, being able to breed out the THC
and up that CBD is going to give you those
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful, you know, dripping resinous
flower flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, essentially, if you're a farmer,
if you're if you're going to start a
[SPEAKER_02]: business and a farmer, you're looking at
it kind of like, are you targeting no THC
[SPEAKER_02]: or CBD or high CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: With no THC, which allows you to sell
more, you know, globally and more
[SPEAKER_02]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a real, you know, that's an
attractive incentive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that way, you know, breeding out the
THC and just having the CBD is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when if someone's putting in
that much effort to create those seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are really valuable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also know that the hemp variety,
you know, sort of across the globe,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's that point three percent that they're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that it's, you know, non-structured and
it's not going to be necessarily put into
[SPEAKER_05]: the cannabis industry with restrictions.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're looking for that point three
percent THC, that's going to really be
[SPEAKER_05]: found in the hemp varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're finding those super, super low THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you just want to, you know,
up all of the rest of the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_05]: profile in your terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a big hunt in the hemp world as
well as in the CBD drug cultivar world
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if you guys would be
familiar with this next part, but
[SPEAKER_00]: basically what I had noticed was whenever
I had tried a CBD extract, like most
[SPEAKER_00]: notably the really highly refined ones,
you know, like they're looking really
[SPEAKER_00]: white crystalline type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found like, yeah, it just really
wasn't medicinal in the way that like say
[SPEAKER_00]: a CBD flower was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this like a, you know, a kind of a
pertinent point in your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like are you kind of on that same
wavelength of like it loses that medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: value as it gets more processed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that you're just extracting
just the CBD and then you've got that 99%
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD crystallate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means that it doesn't really have
any other, you know, terpenes in it for
[SPEAKER_05]: sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no terpenes and as well as there's
no cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've lost sort of this dynamic
profile where they all work together.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, one, what you're saying there is
really interesting because you could have
[SPEAKER_05]: something that, you know, is maybe a five
milligram CBD and if it has CBDV in it and
[SPEAKER_05]: CBDN in it and it's sort of like a full
profile, you're going to feel that so much
[SPEAKER_05]: more than say a hundred milligram straight
CBD isolate.
[SPEAKER_05]: At least that's been what I've really
experienced and other people have
[SPEAKER_05]: experienced across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that has a lot to do with the
terpenes, you know, and the dynamic effect
[SPEAKER_02]: of the entourage where everything's
working together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's almost pharmaceutical in the
sense to try and, you know, isolate or
[SPEAKER_02]: distillate, you know, certain parts of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's reasons for that and there's a
lot of medicines you can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not saying at all that's not a good
thing, but I feel like I do think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: more dynamic in the corrective medicine
aspect of it when you get the other
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes in there because they work
together and they really create your
[SPEAKER_02]: immune, they really boost your immune
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the end, you know, you're trying to
boost your immune system and those are
[SPEAKER_02]: that endocannabinoid system will be
charged up with as many different
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the doctors have proven that
through research is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a one by one is a good one, is a good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I definitely have found personally,
at least that the one-to-one seems to work
[SPEAKER_00]: really nicely for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we take a little step back though,
from what we were just talking about with
[SPEAKER_00]: the ultra most extracted slash process end
of things and we just go kind of more to
[SPEAKER_00]: the midway, how do you guys feel about say
extracts which have added terpenes put
[SPEAKER_00]: back in them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like it's like a two step
forward, three step back type situation or
[SPEAKER_00]: what's your view?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that, you know, there's
people using terpenes that are made from
[SPEAKER_02]: foods and they're just getting like
mercine from wherever mercine comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for sure, that's not really a thing
that we promote or condone at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're going to use terpenes in
there, they should be from Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, I mean, the whole goal is to
preserve your terpenes with your growing
[SPEAKER_02]: practices and with your curing practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you go to extract, I mean,
hopefully you don't need to add any
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, but you know, when you're making
different oils, you can get terpenes from
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is really fun to work with terpenes
and do different things with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: the aromatherapy and different things you
can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think you have to be kind of gentle
with using them for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last little thing I want to touch on on
this kind of CBD topic was I watched a
[SPEAKER_00]: little segment of you guys talking on
YouTube and you were talking about how you
[SPEAKER_00]: think some CBD slash just funky,
you know, cannabinoid profiles may be
[SPEAKER_00]: related to the soil itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a really interesting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing I thought of is do you
think it's more related to the microbes or
[SPEAKER_00]: to the amendments you're using?
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely to the microbiology,
because if you've got a living soil,
[SPEAKER_05]: then you're really not feeding your plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: The focus then becomes that you're feeding
the soil and then that soil becomes a vast
[SPEAKER_05]: organism that then you're trying to feed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and when you feed them, say,
terpene rich nutrients, then it's really
[SPEAKER_05]: the breakdown of the fungi and the
bacteria and all of the different
[SPEAKER_05]: microbiology in there that then feeds it
up to the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think to feed really, you know,
biodynamic accumulators that are terpene
[SPEAKER_05]: rich is probably a really good idea,
but it's going to go through the
[SPEAKER_05]: microbiology before it hits the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's always a through way,
you know, with a beautiful living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we've definitely found with
testing with our medicine before that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a lot of the facilities we've
worked with have seen, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a really broad array of cannabinoids and
even some really unique ones that they
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for sure, you know, science backs this
as the microbiology is what really allows
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant to produce the secondary
metabolites that it has.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we definitely know if you grow one
the same clone and, you know, ten
[SPEAKER_02]: different environments in or outdoor and
whatever it is with different even with
[SPEAKER_02]: different nutrients, you will get
different cannabinoid and terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so for sure, there's like that's what's
fun about growing this plant is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when you give it some something
really unique, it allows it to express
[SPEAKER_02]: itself to its full full extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so, yes, adding a really, really live
and rich microbiology to your soil is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to really, really help, you know,
the diversity of your cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to be we we have been
working with a lab here in B.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: for about a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, they're going to be coming
out to our farm and we're going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: doing soil tests along with plant tissue
tests and really trying to get to the
[SPEAKER_05]: bottom of it, because this lab is seen,
like Josh had said, some really rare
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids and they don't even have the
ability to test them all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really feel like we can give a seed
that's, you know, our own, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that we've been breeding up here for maybe
12 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we feel like it's a pretty stable
strain after 12 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll give it to somebody else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those rare cannabinoids are maybe not
being found.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we feel like maybe more and more rare
cannabinoids are going to be found with,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, building of soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been on our land for now 11
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, what is it going to be like
15 years from now when our soils are built
[SPEAKER_05]: up to even more maximum?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are we going to be able to get cannabinoid
profiles that are really rare?
[SPEAKER_05]: We believe that we will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we and we have, you know, a long time
strain that we've been using.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last year, all of a sudden we had 10
percent CBD out of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did have CBD show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for sure, there's a relationship
within the soil and within the roots
[SPEAKER_02]: growing together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really envision that when we're
growing and in the teas and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're making, we're thinking,
oh, how is this going to affect our
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere and that community and that
that neuro communication that happens
[SPEAKER_02]: within the soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's super I mean, we really love
thinking about the roots and when we see
[SPEAKER_02]: the hyphae and how it all goes together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're really dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people have even proven that there's
electromagnetic pulses going through
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So plants communicating with themselves in
the soil allow them to be healthier and
[SPEAKER_02]: once again, express themselves to more
diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we believe that, you know,
cannabis is a social plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why we believe that is
because it drops its seeds on the ground
[SPEAKER_05]: right around the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of that mother plant then
drops all of the mulching leaves and
[SPEAKER_05]: actually feeds it to her next generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all of those seeds will sort of grow
close together in a natural setting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that makes it a very social plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that we recognize if
plants are in pots and then we put them
[SPEAKER_05]: out into the ground, we immediately see
that there's some kind of a completion of
[SPEAKER_05]: the circuits, a completion of the
electricity, a completion of the
[SPEAKER_05]: communication between the plants so that
they can help each other out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that's definitely a part of
the cannabinoid profile as well is how
[SPEAKER_05]: happy is your plant?
[SPEAKER_05]: If your plant is incredibly happy,
then it's going to be able to show its
[SPEAKER_05]: full capabilities for the medicine and the
terpenes that it puts out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also why we really condone having
your plants in the earth and not in pots
[SPEAKER_02]: above the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's part of our pure certification
and part of the farms that we work with
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone is building, you know,
beds connected to the earth and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: better for water, water retention.
[SPEAKER_02]: You in Australia, you know, you guys have
a big, huge water problem, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of times in the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, learning about those
techniques is going to be extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: important for you all too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a whole bunch of questions
related to that, but I just want to jump
[SPEAKER_00]: back to something you referenced a moment
ago where you said you wonder what the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil slash your farm will be like in 15
years from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I wanted to ask you specifically
was, do you know if the concept of
[SPEAKER_00]: probiotic runoff exists, so to speak,
like, let's just say, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: your beds are just pumping it out for the
next 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think at some point you reach
saturation and the microbes then start to
[SPEAKER_00]: leach off to elsewhere and you're kind of
bio-remediating elsewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it's going to be quite
localized?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to, I will reference
Paul's statements on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, in his studies is that there
was cow farms above the oil oyster fields
[SPEAKER_02]: out in Olympia and the oyster fields and
oyster farmers in the water were,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, losing their crop and not being
able, the oysters weren't growing and they
[SPEAKER_02]: were losing their crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're, oh my God, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting poisoned by cows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what they did is they inoculated
bales of hay with oyster mushrooms and
[SPEAKER_02]: they built channels for the runoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the water, when the rain came in,
when extra groundwaters came, the
[SPEAKER_02]: groundwater could filter through the bales
of hay, which in the end did save the
[SPEAKER_02]: oyster fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just goes to prove, and we talk
about this a lot with land formation when
[SPEAKER_02]: people are doing earthworks on their
property is to build burlap balls and
[SPEAKER_02]: inoculate it with biology because we know
that you do affect the area around you
[SPEAKER_02]: through biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having really dedicated beds or swales
around your property that have really live
[SPEAKER_02]: mycology or biology in your soils,
it does affect your neighbors and it does
[SPEAKER_02]: affect your water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to be really careful about,
you know, building your property properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it does affect your neighbors in a
positive way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I answer that properly?
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there is going to be runoff with
your beneficials or your microbiology in
[SPEAKER_05]: your beds, then if it's on your land,
that's nothing but awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as reaching ultimate peak of
microbiology, microbiology is just
[SPEAKER_05]: constantly eating and colonizing and dying
and eating and colonizing and dying.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just part of what it does.
[SPEAKER_05]: It changes seasonally.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll change on a hot day.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're having blazing hot days,
then all of that beautiful microbiology
[SPEAKER_05]: that might be in the first inch of the
soil is going to go down quite deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So not only does it ebb and flow in
numbers, but it also ebbs and flows in
[SPEAKER_05]: depth and also how wide it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really encourage people that you may
start with one garden bed, but the view is
[SPEAKER_05]: to see a beautiful, intelligent
microbiology biome that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: expands out from your garden and then it
goes out to your property.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if it attaches onto your
neighbor's property, then all you're doing
[SPEAKER_05]: is creating a beautiful, safe haven for a
lot of microbiology that's dying in the
[SPEAKER_05]: world today with all of the different
toxins.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if microbiology can have beautiful
islands of health and well-being,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, in people's farms or even in a
garden bed or in a large farm,
[SPEAKER_05]: then it is a positive impact for the whole
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the beds are never done, so we're
always adding to them, like Kelly said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in 15 years, we'll have to add to
our beds 15 times at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that you guys are big advocates
of the use of IMO and as we just heard,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I was wondering, you know,
obviously you've never said it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but are you against kind of bringing in
external microbes, you know, or are you
[SPEAKER_00]: okay with that, but you just prefer to use
indigenous ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the most notable example of
this would be mammoth pee, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you sit on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, we do, we have our own
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: That have a different array of bacteria,
as well as endomycorrhizal fungi,
[SPEAKER_05]: as well as different glomus species.
[SPEAKER_05]: We feel like if you can introduce
something that's really beneficial and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's going to take, then that's absolutely
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really no different than adding
probiotics to your body.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you add different types of
probiotics, you know, the lactobacillus or
[SPEAKER_05]: the bacillus, then that's just going to
inoculate your body.
[SPEAKER_05]: It may only inoculate your body for 72
hours and then you have to re-inoculate it
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's going to stay in the upper
respiratory tract.
[SPEAKER_05]: But some of these soil microbiology that
we introduce to our body, which we know as
[SPEAKER_05]: human beings, we're completely deficient
in, which has had so many health issues on
[SPEAKER_05]: the planet today.
[SPEAKER_05]: IBS and colitis and I could go on and on
leaky gut syndrome and all of these
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even clear thinking brain capabilities,
you know, all really are based in
[SPEAKER_05]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the same way that maybe we're going
to be deficient in some type of a really
[SPEAKER_05]: important microbe, you know, you can
introduce it to your body in the same way
[SPEAKER_05]: that maybe your farm is deficient in
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also, you know, introduce it to
your farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the most important thing is when you
introduce it, you can't be introducing it
[SPEAKER_05]: in a way that it's not going to be
colonizing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to really look at what kind of
microbiology that you're bringing in to
[SPEAKER_05]: create a beautiful environment so that it
will colonize right away is the real goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that you're not continually buying this
microbiology to inoculate, inoculate,
[SPEAKER_05]: inoculate your soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great to re-inoculate your teas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe Josh will talk a little bit
about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, another thing that we think about
when it comes to biology is that our
[SPEAKER_02]: number one question is what biology and
where did it come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of biology companies out
there that are rooted in GMO companies and
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that are involved in a lot of
practices worldwide that we don't agree
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to even predators,
you know, if you're getting predators for
[SPEAKER_02]: your garden, you have to be really careful
of where you get your predators from
[SPEAKER_02]: because some of those companies are
involved in really large scale GMO
[SPEAKER_02]: products and farms that we don't agree
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a number one question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of it's produced on substrate
that's GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to know what the biology
substrate is that it's being colonized on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are some of the questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, mammoth pee, you know,
for example, if you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't like to talk about any in
particular companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people use that, you know,
in products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you're shipping liquid
around the world and stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you think about the container that it's
involved in and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can try and even with our
products, you know, we try and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, tell people how to make it
locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's better for the gardening and
better for your environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So biology is best being tried to be made
in soils, you know, and then bringing it
[SPEAKER_02]: into teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's where where we have our
products and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our products represent herbs and herbal
medicine, which is certified organic herbs
[SPEAKER_02]: with a certified organic bacteria account.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we make a bacteria colony and
when we make teas out of it, the herbs
[SPEAKER_02]: just go through the tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they you water the beds,
the herbs go onto the top of the soil so
[SPEAKER_02]: you can colonize them in the tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can they continue to colonize
when they're in the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and we're talking a lot about our
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: But more importantly, we teach people to
not use products at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, all of our products have
every single recipe on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really we really encourage people to
grow this herbal biomass themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then it becomes closed loop.
[SPEAKER_05]: You also can inoculate and grow out all of
your own species of different types of
[SPEAKER_05]: inoculants, whether that's a fungi or
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we utilize a tremendous amount
of lactic acid bacteria cultures here,
[SPEAKER_05]: as well as different types of soil
bacteria to help break down the raw plant
[SPEAKER_05]: mass.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we grow a tremendous amount of herbal
biomass on our products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we also have a very important
property here that then gets chopped up
[SPEAKER_05]: and broken down into a tea container.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you add all of that microbiology
so that it eats it up at a very rapid
[SPEAKER_05]: rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you aerate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a really an anaerobic beginning
stages of that, because those anaerobes
[SPEAKER_05]: are incredibly, you know, voracious and
they eat through things that are very
[SPEAKER_05]: rapid rates and they're digesters.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you have that in an anaerobic and
then you switch your anaerobic fermented
[SPEAKER_05]: teas into an aerobic compound by adding
air to it, then that gets all of your
[SPEAKER_05]: anaerobes away and then it's ready to
drench.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it will be fully full of all of
the great microbiology that you're looking
[SPEAKER_05]: for that's going to continue to break down
that material in your soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a question kind of relating to the teas
that I wanted to ask you is, do you see
[SPEAKER_00]: any downside to artificially extending the
life of your tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, maybe, you know,
you've had it brewing for a few days and
[SPEAKER_00]: you haven't used it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just throw a bit of extra
carbohydrate sauce in there or something
[SPEAKER_00]: along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that that's like,
you know, detrimental?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you avoid doing that or how do you
feel about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's not going to be the best way
to build the colony of your tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, if the purpose of having
a tea to begin with is to build mycology
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not mycology, but microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, you start with one thing
and you add a little bit of molasses or
[SPEAKER_02]: something to it, organic or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can get into that whether to use
organic molasses or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you use the aeration to charge up the
tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you charge up the tea,
you know, you're building the colony and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the point of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you just extend that, you're just
losing the colony that you built because
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't wait around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just live and die, you know,
fast organisms.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they've eaten up a lot of the
nutrients that you've already put in there
[SPEAKER_05]: and then you add more inoculants in there,
then it's not going to be the same
[SPEAKER_05]: colonies that have eaten up the initial
foods or nutrients that you've put in
[SPEAKER_05]: there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be sort of a different
colony that takes over.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really interesting because
colonies can change in a tea brew from
[SPEAKER_05]: hour to hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they can change depending on how
warm the weather is, how much humidity is
[SPEAKER_05]: in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or, you know, depending on what you put in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a really we really don't look at
our teas any different than you would like
[SPEAKER_05]: a stomach or a digestive tract.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to make sure to put everything in
there and then give it the ability to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to digest it fully with all
beneficial microbiology.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we really don't separate it between
the human digestive tract and a tea brew.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as the teas, we just do it a little
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we do it kind of like the art of
fermentation on one side and then we
[SPEAKER_02]: activate it on the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's different than a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of our listeners will
probably kill me if I don't ask,
[SPEAKER_00]: how long do you brew your teas for
generally?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you use like a kind of a rule of
thumb to see when they're ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, a lot of people will say
when there's a nice healthy froth on top,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then, you know, you'll have other
people who will say that's not always
[SPEAKER_00]: indicative that it's done, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, where do you sit on that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, most importantly, you know,
the very end, I could go through the
[SPEAKER_05]: beginning of it, but the very end is taste
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, really, if you're utilizing
things in your tea that you know are good
[SPEAKER_05]: for the soil and good for the
microbiology, you know, of course,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can get a pH meter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, you can look at the bubbles,
you can smell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you taste your tea, it's totally
inert.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has zero flavor at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could put a tremendous amount of
biomass in there, chop up all of your
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the anaerobic part of it,
which usually is between five and seven
[SPEAKER_05]: days, it can go up to 10 days during
really cold cycles.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's more warm, then it's going to be
faster to five days.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your anaerobic brew.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you take that anaerobic brew
and then you put it into another
[SPEAKER_05]: container, you know, by straining out all
of the biomass and the herbs and
[SPEAKER_05]: everything, you put it into another
container and you aerate it, it should
[SPEAKER_05]: have zero smell and the taste of it should
be totally inert.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for us, that's saying it's done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that gives a really beautiful
color to the tea and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our aeration usually is between 24 and
72 hours, well, 12, actually 12 and 72
[SPEAKER_05]: hours, depending on what cycle our plants
are in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the general rule of thumb,
you know, is 12 to 24 hours tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, then you're going on just,
you know, compost tea knowledge,
[SPEAKER_02]: just, you know, basic compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tea knowledge, you know, which is a
certain, you know, a third of a tablespoon
[SPEAKER_02]: or of a pound, you know, per gallon or and
then you, and you bubble it overnight,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, or 12 to 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do it longer than that,
you lose your colony.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of reasons why,
you know, even just steeping it overnight
[SPEAKER_02]: makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can take like herbs, like dried
herbs and some compost tea and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: just steep it overnight and then just
drench it onto your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's really good for your soil
microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's really a lot of different ways
to make teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that you have to really think
about, you know, what your goal is and are
[SPEAKER_02]: you indoor?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you soil-less?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have outdoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there really is a lot of questions on
how you're growing, on how you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: tap you.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not just one way to do a tea from
our perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we really like to, you know,
us personally, just like Josh said,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a lot of different ways to make
teas, but we really like to have control
[SPEAKER_05]: over, you know, what's in our tea brewers,
which is the reason why we work with
[SPEAKER_05]: herbal biomass and our inoculants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not really working with compost
because, you know, the variety of
[SPEAKER_05]: differentiation of microbiology in there
is so huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so vast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really like to have control over
what's in our tea brews so that we know
[SPEAKER_05]: what's going to be the end product that
we're not going to have anything anaerobic
[SPEAKER_05]: in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to have anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, unless it's a facultative anaerobe
and then that's really awesome,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know, nothing that would be
detrimental to the root system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really like to have control over
what is in our tea brews.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we pick and choose particular
inoculants that we make here on our own
[SPEAKER_05]: property to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just read my mind because I was going
to ask you about a facultative anaerobe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was going to say, I was talking to
Mr. Bob Hemphill and he's saying he's a
[SPEAKER_00]: big fan of adding Bacachy or, you know,
EM4, IMO4, whatever you're making it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel the same way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you like adding Bacachy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where you kind of incorporate that,
you know, the anaerobic with the aerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: or do you prefer as you referenced a
moment ago to have, you know, like your
[SPEAKER_00]: ferment stage and then your activation
stage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think with Bacachy and different
things like that, you have to be careful
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's acidic in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really using less of it is using more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do like Bacachy because we like
lactic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lactic acid bacteria because it's,
you know, the main, you know, fermenting
[SPEAKER_02]: microbe and sauerkraut and most of the
foods that we eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do like propagating lactic acid
bacteria on our property.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we usually do that through making
teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as, you know, our soils go and our
beds, we treat them like a compost pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're kind of always adding stuff and
it creates like a healthy gut for the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, you know, we're slowly adding to
it all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our IMOs are basically attracted to our
beds and we don't feel we need to go
[SPEAKER_02]: collect IMOs even though we'll bring
handfuls of dirt from different
[SPEAKER_02]: environments that we think are really
healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we'll propagate those through
teas and drench them onto our beds to
[SPEAKER_02]: spread the microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we generally use mulch and biomass and
covering our beds to attract the
[SPEAKER_02]: indigenous microbes to our beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have less and less compost piles
and more and more just our beds or our
[SPEAKER_02]: compost.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, to answer your question,
the facultative microbes are just totally
[SPEAKER_05]: imperative for the beginning stages of the
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those facultative microbes are the ones
that are just so hardcore and quick
[SPEAKER_05]: digesters and they can make, you know,
the difference between a pretty pathogenic
[SPEAKER_05]: tea and a totally beneficial tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the end facultative means that they
can propagate in an anaerobic condition or
[SPEAKER_02]: an aerobic condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're attracted in our life,
we're attracted to microbes that to us,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's adaptogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They adapt.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're able to live and propagate in an
anaerobic situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you go to what we say
activate the tea, then they change with
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we like having those kind of microbes
that can adapt and we want to propagate
[SPEAKER_02]: that and put that into our soils because,
you know, the environment is ever
[SPEAKER_02]: changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our bodies are ever changing and we just
want a really healthy, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: biome around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I noticed on a few different Instagram
posts, sometimes people will ask you maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: like what you're using in a specific
picture in relation to say a top dress or
[SPEAKER_00]: like something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the general answer you kind of give is
like, oh, you know, like we're just using
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that's around the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you try to maintain that philosophy
everywhere you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that more so applicable just
because, you know, like obviously on your
[SPEAKER_00]: farm, you've got access to a lot of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are able to just kind of use what's
around, but maybe somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I guess what the question is,
is do you think that there's stuff people
[SPEAKER_00]: can use no matter where they are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think you guys are a little bit
lucky and that you do have stuff laying
[SPEAKER_00]: around, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's totally important that people utilize
what they have around their own
[SPEAKER_05]: environment, because that own,
whatever they have in their own
[SPEAKER_05]: environment is, is intelligent to that
area, you know, to utilize plants that are
[SPEAKER_05]: growing really well and that are super
healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We also, you know, with our pure
certification, we have to have,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, people are looking for at least
six closed loops and creating your own
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrients and growing your own biomass is
a really big part of that loop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's ever changing depending on
where you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you're in Arizona,
you're going to be utilizing a tremendous
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of prickly pear and cactus and
different types of sagebrush.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's incredible the nutrients that are
available in those plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also the cyanobacteria that's on the
outside of those leaves are the plants
[SPEAKER_05]: that are there for a reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're there to keep the plant healthy
during its life, but they're also there to
[SPEAKER_05]: help digest it in the time of its death or
when the leaves drop to the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're collecting biomass in your
area, you're also collecting microbiology
[SPEAKER_05]: on the leaf structure as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, your tea should be
absolutely as intelligent as they possibly
[SPEAKER_05]: can be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to come from your own
property.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've, we definitely have chosen the
area that we live in for a reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it is rich in biomass and we do
really resonate with this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that part is true.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are really lucky where we live.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like Kelly said, and we, we have
traveled the world to a lot of different
[SPEAKER_02]: places.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've worked on a lot of, you know,
international projects and disaster
[SPEAKER_02]: projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went to Jamaica for a month this
year and, and worked with the Rasta
[SPEAKER_02]: village there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we worked with, with, you know,
making biomass gardens everywhere that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: In each country that we've gone to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, we don't think that it's,
it's something that just we do on our
[SPEAKER_02]: property.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we say it's absolutely imperative for
people to do it everywhere they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time we go somewhere,
we really, you know, really look to the
[SPEAKER_02]: area as soon as we get there and say,
Oh, what can we use?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what can we use there?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that you can get really
creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing about our pure
certification as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of the farmers that, that we,
that are, are part of that movement and
[SPEAKER_02]: that regenerative movement of cannabis is
that, you know, it's part, it's part of
[SPEAKER_02]: connecting with your environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the way that you can really,
really ensure that you're, you're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: clean inputs into your farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we haven't talked about that yet,
but having clean inputs onto your farm is
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely imperative and moving forward
in the new legalization paradigm of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to be extremely careful about the
products that we bring into our property.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's been a big part of this
regenerative cannabis movement is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is people, that's why people have,
have started to grow more diversity on
[SPEAKER_02]: their property.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, part of being pure certified is
you can't just have a cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to grow other, other biomass
like, like Kelly was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and then that's part of connecting
with your land.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trees and bushes and grass and,
and even, you know, local livestock and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff are a crucial part of building life
on your farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you have an indoor operation,
you can still use, you know, the edges of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the land around it to,
to make, you know, mass for your gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and part of being regenerative is
understanding the botany that grows around
[SPEAKER_05]: your region in your area.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and a lot of people that call
something maybe a noxious weed that's come
[SPEAKER_05]: in from an outside source, those noxious
weeds are there for a reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's because they have found a home that
is going to be able to help them express,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, their true health and wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those can be utilized so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that helps found the noxious
weeds in your area, but then you're also
[SPEAKER_05]: utilizing them in your teas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we suggest to make sure to utilize
those noxious weeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: before they seed so that you're not
continuing, you know, the propagation of
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's something that you have on
your property, of course use it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, in Oregon and in Northern
California, they have a tremendous amount
[SPEAKER_05]: of Himalayan blackberry and an Alpine
blackberry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It grows there like crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you start looking at all of the
nutritive capabilities that this plant
[SPEAKER_05]: has, when you chop it up or you put it in
a tea, the amount of growth hormones that
[SPEAKER_05]: are in it, then you have an understanding
of why it's so noxious because it has such
[SPEAKER_05]: incredible capability to grow so fast in a
really small space.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really encourage people to look
around and understand the plant life
[SPEAKER_05]: that's around your area and then start
picking and choosing what you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: propagate and also what you want to put
into your teas or into your compost or
[SPEAKER_05]: chip up or put on the top as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you could go on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a question where it's kind of
like the devil's in the details,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I guess what I'm wondering is would
you want to say not use something which is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of external, but it would have been a
waste anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm getting at is I love to go
down to my local coffee store and grab the
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee grinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just my plants love it when
I top dress it with them, but I understand
[SPEAKER_00]: it brings with a myriad of questions,
you know, like where's the beans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it GMO?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, all that type of stuff
that comes along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those reasons, is it just something
you would look to avoid or are you okay
[SPEAKER_00]: with something like that where broadly
speaking, you are kind of using what would
[SPEAKER_00]: have otherwise been wasted?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, we're living in a world of
international products and in an
[SPEAKER_05]: international world of food.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's something that you feel
like, wow, you know, this would be really
[SPEAKER_05]: good for my farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely find out what the sources go
all the way down with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have an intuition that those
coffee grounds are going to be great for
[SPEAKER_05]: your farm and you feel like it would be
really helpful, then it's good to take in
[SPEAKER_05]: a small amount of whatever said thing that
you're bringing into your property and
[SPEAKER_05]: utilize it in a small area.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give like a trial of two to three weeks or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a look at it and then say,
yeah, my intuition is right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I believe with science and all of
these tests and trials that we do
[SPEAKER_05]: involving science, it's starting to take
away, you know, our basic, innate
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding of intuition.
[SPEAKER_05]: And gardening is such an intuitive thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, humans are of the earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Plants are of the earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we communicate with each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, we're having conversations on
another level and we really encourage
[SPEAKER_05]: people to have those conversations with
your land and your soil and the plants
[SPEAKER_05]: around you and also the inputs that you're
going to be able to bring in.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's a really an individual matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also whatever inputs that you're
bringing in, make sure that you feel
[SPEAKER_05]: really good about it and that your
intuition is right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is sound to create a good ultimate
immune response and wherever you're
[SPEAKER_05]: putting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, it brings up, you know,
another question is, number one,
[SPEAKER_02]: where are you in the world?
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, we always, you know,
we always talk about being crafty and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we have to be resourceful and
use, you know, what's in our area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on where you live in the
world and with cannabis, especially,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is a dynamic accumulator, accumulates
stuff out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So depending on what level of scrutiny you
have, I mean, there's some farms that
[SPEAKER_02]: can't use, you know, municipalities that
produce prosperity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, compost like from different cities
because of different sprays that might be
[SPEAKER_02]: used, you know, on the roadside.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they used that compost thinking,
oh, geez, you know the our city produces
[SPEAKER_02]: compost and I just want to use compost
from my city.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just only makes all the sense in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on a human level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it does make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if on on an actual reality of testing
you could potentially fail tests with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis by using bad inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I mean, you have to be really
pretty mindful in certain places.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other places, you know, it only makes
sense to use what's around you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also to add to what, you know,
Josh was just saying is that there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: tremendous amount, you know, in North
America right now and also in other parts
[SPEAKER_05]: of the world of the use of glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And glyphosate is not something that's
even being tested because Department of
[SPEAKER_05]: Ag's all over the world and these really
large multinational, multi-international
[SPEAKER_05]: corporations feel like glyphosate is
totally healthy and that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we should be able to drink it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So why is it a problem?
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're finding it more and more along
the roadsides.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're finding it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then prolonged use in your soil beds
is going to kill your microbiology.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an herbicide and an herbicide,
you know, kills all different types of
[SPEAKER_05]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it has a huge, long life.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the half-lifes that they're
saying now, you know, they've already
[SPEAKER_05]: negated at least 10 times over.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the truth is, is that we don't really
know how long those half-lifes are of
[SPEAKER_05]: these horrible chemicals and over
prolonged use in your gardens,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to be killing all of your
microbiology, which is going against
[SPEAKER_05]: everything that you began by being able to
bring in those inputs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a really, it's a difficult
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have an indoor garden, you may not
have a soil that's as vigorous as an
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: In an outdoor garden, you have the ability
to create a ton of biomass and a ton of
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if your positive microbiology
outweighs the little bit of toxins that
[SPEAKER_02]: you might be getting from an inorganic
coffee thing, then it would probably,
[SPEAKER_02]: it might remediate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you get anything out of balance,
you could throw that off and kill the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiology, like what Kelly's saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're not really believing that,
you know, nature and microbiology,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, are not very good at remediating
horrible toxins on the planet,
[SPEAKER_05]: any better than we're able to remediate
those toxins when we ingest it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we always go back to human health,
soil health, plant health, it's just all
[SPEAKER_05]: the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: So whenever there's information out there
in the science world and you're looking up
[SPEAKER_05]: a particular product or something,
or some kind of an input, look at all of
[SPEAKER_05]: the human health that it has.
[SPEAKER_05]: Attached to it as well, you know,
take the time to Google all of that
[SPEAKER_05]: information and go deeper.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it affects pollinators or how it
affects our own immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know then if I was,
so for example, here in Australia,
[SPEAKER_00]: glyphosate is incredibly widely used.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's almost no concern about it,
at least in the sense of their ways in the
[SPEAKER_00]: States, which is a little alarming,
but essentially if I was to buy a new
[SPEAKER_00]: property and move on there, I would bet my
left leg that it's been sprayed down with
[SPEAKER_00]: glyphosate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, obviously, you know,
the details would give the specifics of
[SPEAKER_00]: this situation, but if you had to give a
rule of thumb, how long would you think it
[SPEAKER_00]: would take for me to kind of buy or
remediate that kind of land I bought?
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, would you be okay
with say consuming the first crop produced
[SPEAKER_00]: on that land, or would you want to do some
work first before you were feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I would, I would start to sort of begin
the question that where you started at the
[SPEAKER_05]: end there was, I would definitely start by
a remediation with plant matter that
[SPEAKER_05]: wasn't vegetables that I would be eating
as far as a time period of how long that
[SPEAKER_05]: would take to remediate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, possibly your whole lives and your
grandchildren's lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that we just don't know
because the information that we're getting
[SPEAKER_05]: is so one-sided because it's all being put
out by the makers of this particular
[SPEAKER_05]: product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've got, you know, a real
investment to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_05]: scientific research goes along the way
that they would like it to go along.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we know for sure that heavily laden
glyphosate areas, you just simply put a
[SPEAKER_05]: pea in there or a bean, it won't grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't, you know, those are kind of
plants that don't do very well with
[SPEAKER_05]: herbicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you buy the property, go try and
plant peas on it because peas are one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the most susceptible things to herbicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just be like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I plant a row of peas here right now
and come back a week later?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they've sprouted, then you've got
something you can work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they don't sprout and there's no
reason for it, you might seriously
[SPEAKER_02]: consider it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we totally tell people to test the
soil for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're going to buy a piece of land.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can test it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with glyphosate, like I know,
I'm not sure exactly about soil tests in
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia, but there'll be soil tests that
have, you know, 30 different, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides and herbicides that they test
for, but glyphosate will not be one of
[SPEAKER_02]: them for the same reason that you just
said, because, you know, they think,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, you know, you can dump, you know,
glyphosate in your Cheetos in the morning
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so you really have to be, you know,
very mindful of what you're using and get
[SPEAKER_02]: a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kind of in related to all this
stuff, the first thing I'll add is that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think unfortunately in Australia,
soil tests are quite cost prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think to get a fairly basic one,
you're probably looking at around 150 to
[SPEAKER_00]: $200, which I think that's some tests in
the States are like that expensive,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it certainly seems very expensive
here, especially considering, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in like an illegal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something I did want to ask you guys
about was just the interesting range of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil additives you have in that excuse me,
the cocoa, that's the one which the cocoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one which grabs my interest the
most, you know, cause it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see alfalfa, you see, you see a lot of
stuff being used by a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that you guys use all of that
stuff in a really interesting way,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the cocoa, the cocoa was the one which
really grabbed my interest because you
[SPEAKER_00]: just, you don't see it outside of your
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did you come up with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was kind of the rationale behind
it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the rationale is when you look at a
plant and you see a plant through its
[SPEAKER_05]: whole cycle, it starts out as a sprout.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, it starts out as a seed and
the seed has all the vast nutrients that
[SPEAKER_05]: are available.
[SPEAKER_05]: It almost becomes like a micro superfood,
a seed does, because it contains
[SPEAKER_05]: everything that that plant should contain
in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once it grows out, then it starts
to have other different kinds of
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrients, like say nitrogen and calcium.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as the plant starts growing out
even more, it's up taking different
[SPEAKER_05]: minerals and different nutrients from the
soil throughout its entire life cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know that for cannabis,
you know, we add a lot of nitrogen at the
[SPEAKER_05]: beginning and then we move to their
phosphorus and potassium and phosphorus
[SPEAKER_05]: and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, plants are no different in,
in the wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're up taking, you know,
basic nutrients at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when they turn into a seed form,
like the cacao, then it starts to become a
[SPEAKER_05]: very nutrient dense product or,
or, you know, in this case, it was a
[SPEAKER_05]: product, but you know, nutrient dense part
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: A cacao mines a tremendous amount of
magnesium and manganese and copper out of
[SPEAKER_05]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a million other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we utilize the raw cacao because when
you test raw cacao, it has a tremendous
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of nutrients that helps a plant
finish because it's the finishing part of
[SPEAKER_05]: the cacao tree.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's no different than say, you know,
you're utilizing maybe sesame seeds are
[SPEAKER_05]: going to contain a lot more finishing
compounds and minerals and nutrients in it
[SPEAKER_05]: than the first sprout of that particular
sesame.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we use spirulina in our
radiant green and in the vegetative one,
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, nothing's more
nutritive than one celled organisms and
[SPEAKER_02]: algaes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the raw cacao has a wide
variety of trace minerals and nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: and vitamins at the very end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, and also the wild yam is one
that you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you want us to talk about more of the
ingredients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially what I wanted to hear was what
organic ingredients you look to for
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause phosphorus is one of those ones
where it's a little less common to come
[SPEAKER_00]: by.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Phosphorus can definitely be mined up in a
plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's lots of different plants that are
going to contain phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I was saying before, it's going
to be the ending part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to have the most phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_05]: So tubers, wild yam has, you know,
phosphorus as well as like yams that you
[SPEAKER_05]: eat out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: Potatoes have a lot of phosphorus in our
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: We utilize burdock root.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why we utilize burdock root
is just 5,000 years of ancient Chinese
[SPEAKER_05]: history, you know, of, of, of healing of
the body.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like I had said before, we always look
at the healing of the body, the same as
[SPEAKER_05]: healing of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And burdock has so many healing modalities
because of the tremendous amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the nutrients in there that's
so rich is phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_05]: So rather than getting mined phosphorus or
phosphorus that really leeches out into
[SPEAKER_05]: the soil, you know, you can add rock
phosphate and you're going to lose about
[SPEAKER_05]: 80% of that rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas if you feed phosphorus rich
plants, tubers, seeds, finishing parts of
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant and you feed it to the
microbiology, then it becomes immediately
[SPEAKER_05]: available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And phosphorus is one of those ones that,
you know, can be found, like I said,
[SPEAKER_05]: in the finishing parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also a big, a big part of our,
you know, practices that we, that we
[SPEAKER_02]: promote is, is having a, you know,
a type of soil that has a lot of compost
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's composting and living and the
breakdown of, of, of leaf mold,
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf matter and different stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That produces phosphorus in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really believe that, you know,
having an active soil that's being,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's breaking down is producing enough
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't actually, we never use more
phosphorus ever on our property than
[SPEAKER_02]: what's produced just by our soils and
these plants and the seeds and the roots
[SPEAKER_02]: that we use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the last 20 years we've been
growing, you know, in a way that we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: utilize any of those bat guano
phosphoresces.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like this thing, which is rock
phosphate anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, actually it's not in the bat guano.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just having a really active soil and
then using roots and seeds, which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: ending product of the plant, provides the
phosphorus, potassium, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: manganese and all that stuff that we need
to create the flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Josh has touched on something that we feel
is like incredibly important is the use of
[SPEAKER_05]: trees.
[SPEAKER_05]: The use of tree leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trees, the ultimate miners.
[SPEAKER_05]: They send down their roots as tall as they
are.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're mining all kinds of
things in the soil and then they bring
[SPEAKER_05]: them up into their leaves and then they
drop their leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm talking about deciduous trees in
this particular instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not eucalyptus, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't use any eucalyptus, anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they, they take all of the
nutrients up into the tree and then they
[SPEAKER_05]: drop all of those and then the cycle
continues again.
[SPEAKER_05]: So utilizing tree leaves, you know,
contain an incredible amount of minerals
[SPEAKER_05]: and phosphorus is definitely one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that something, when you say the
tree leaves, you're referring to like a
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf mold type of thing, or just a direct
top dressing type of a situation?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you can direct top dress because
it's going to turn into leaf mold
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: We now look at our beds like these living
beings, like we had opened up the
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation to begin with, you know,
so we're always layering things on top of
[SPEAKER_05]: our beds, making sure that we're not
layering anything that would turn it hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we don't want necessarily hot
composting to be happening in the beds,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we certainly want cold composting to
be happening in the beds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the beautiful thing about nature is
that especially when you're in an area
[SPEAKER_05]: that has seasons, everything is available
all at the right time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when the seasons come,
it provides the nutrients that your
[SPEAKER_05]: gardens need at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, all of the flowers start coming
out and the seeds and the tubers start
[SPEAKER_05]: coming out right at the same time that
your plants are needing phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_05]: that your tomatoes are needing phosphorus
to produce juicy tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some kind of a beauty in the
cycles of nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we just pay attention, then it's
all there for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, permaculture did come
out of Tasmania in so many ways and in
[SPEAKER_02]: Australia and there's, there's plenty of
examples, you know, across the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, across the country there and
the, and the continent that, that show as
[SPEAKER_02]: really similar to what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of really good gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Steve Solomon in Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, he's a big guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I wanted to ask you is I had
noticed that over say the past three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four years, there had been this kind of
unspoken trend within the no tool scene,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak, that there'd been,
there'd been a move away from animal
[SPEAKER_00]: products and especially, you know,
in terms of like amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the question which I was wondering
is, do you think that it's the case that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've just found better replacements or
it's more a case that there's also an
[SPEAKER_00]: underlying objection to, you know,
like the raising and the slaughtering?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, all of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to answer that question, I always say
to people, okay, so what does it look like
[SPEAKER_05]: on a hot summer day when you throw a steak
out on the lawn?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's raw.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you leave it there for a week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you throw an apple out on the lawn
and then you leave it there for a week,
[SPEAKER_05]: what kind of different bacteria and fungi
are going to overtake that to be able to
[SPEAKER_05]: digest it down and basically turn it into
soil?
[SPEAKER_05]: The meat is going to have incredibly
aggressive anaerobic fungi and bacteria,
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs and worms and maggots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it could be fun to watch it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to draw a tremendous amount of
pathogens in order for it to become
[SPEAKER_05]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas the apple that's, you know,
being digested on the lawn there on the
[SPEAKER_05]: hot summer day is going to just start
drawing all of these beautiful things that
[SPEAKER_05]: turn white.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could, you know, things meaning
microbiology, it's great fungi and
[SPEAKER_05]: different bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could almost take that rotting
apple and, you know, put it right into
[SPEAKER_05]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't necessarily suggest
this, but then that would become,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, a beneficial colony.
[SPEAKER_05]: You really couldn't take the steak and put
it into there at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we haven't used animal products ever.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not, we've been growing for
almost three decades and we haven't
[SPEAKER_05]: utilized any animal products other than
manure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, you know, from our own farm here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's all grass fed,
no grain.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we feel like the pathogens that
break down that animal matter is just not
[SPEAKER_05]: something that we want to bring into our
gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And nor do we like to support something
that is unkind or harmful to the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through soil testing, I mean,
you, when you're doing no tiller,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing something that's,
that's continuous, you know, where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: using the same stuff for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you do have to be mindful of
what you put in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like Kelly said, you know,
certain animal products just don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: the same kind of longevity that you're
going for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why the forest is so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so beautiful because, you know,
it really shows the power of, of plant
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine and, and how well it can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, you know, organic farmers here
in, in North America to be certified
[SPEAKER_05]: organic on a vegetable farm, they use a
tremendous amount of blood and bone meal,
[SPEAKER_05]: like a tremendous amount.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you test that blood and bone
meal, the glyphosate levels are really
[SPEAKER_05]: high because the cows are eating the grain
that's glyphosate laden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also they're eating the grass that's
glyphosate laden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's bringing all of that into,
so you're not only bringing possible
[SPEAKER_05]: pathogenic nutrients into your property,
but you're also bringing a tremendous
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of glyphosate and who knows what
else.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, really supporting the
slaughterhouses is not something that we
[SPEAKER_05]: feel like we want to touch at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't want to support those
slaughterhouses and we really don't want
[SPEAKER_05]: to support the microbiology that it takes
to break down those slaughterhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also really careful with plants like
neem and caranja and different,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, seed meals that haven't also
lasted very well in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys are not big fans of neem?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, you know, there's neat,
the neem tree is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so of course, you know, we love the
neem tree and, you know, to take neem,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's neem teas and neem
medicine is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just also, you know, it's not
something that promotes, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiology in the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a volatile oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, anything that has any plants
that have large aromatics, you have to be
[SPEAKER_05]: really careful about what those aromatics
are.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you're going to break down a
ton of geranium, you know, you might
[SPEAKER_05]: really want to think of putting a ton of
geranium into your soils because it
[SPEAKER_05]: contains a high geranyl.
[SPEAKER_05]: And geranyl is great to get rid of pests
and, you know, pathogens possibly on the
[SPEAKER_05]: leaf source or maybe in the soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're utilizing it over a long
period of time, then your beneficials
[SPEAKER_05]: aren't going to be like, yay, this is an
awesome soil to be in because there's just
[SPEAKER_05]: such a vast amount of volatile oils.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really stay away from, you know,
eucalyptus or black walnut or even neem in
[SPEAKER_05]: large amounts or caranja or any of these
like super volatile oil plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a way that we want to deal with
the pathogens that those are trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: kill so that we'll use predators for that
instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't need to top dress with neem
and those kind of things because we know
[SPEAKER_02]: that the neem is going to kill other
microbiology because we work with,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a lot of people that,
you know, do soil testing all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've shown that, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's not a thing that we use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've always felt like that kind of
weary about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in general, do you veer more
towards wanting to have, say, a bacterial
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant soil, a fungal dominant soil,
or just a kind of a one-to-one type of
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio?
[SPEAKER_05]: Always a blend.
[SPEAKER_05]: Always a blend.
[SPEAKER_05]: You definitely want to have your bacteria
is just going to last in there for a short
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's awesome that your bacteria,
that your teas are super bacteria rich and
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're soils are really fun fungi
rich so that the bacteria is going to stay
[SPEAKER_05]: in there long enough just to break down
that green material, the leaf material,
[SPEAKER_05]: light material, and then be able to give
it to the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, the prolonged breakdown of
the soil is definitely, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: our fungi friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost easy to get the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not, you know, it's it's you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We with Hugo culture and with,
you know, carbon sequestration and carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: farming is really to attract fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really kind of doing all we can
to get more fungi into our soils because
[SPEAKER_02]: through a lot of soil testing,
you know, you'd find that there's lower
[SPEAKER_02]: fungal mass and there is bacterial,
you know, mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, you know, that's why we're adding
biomass so much to our soils is the fungi
[SPEAKER_02]: really interact with the roots and
directly feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're feeding a lot of soil fungi by
feeding it bacteria.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a whole lot of really awesome
fungi that eats bacteria directly that
[SPEAKER_05]: have, you know, this beautiful
relationship with the top layer is totally
[SPEAKER_05]: bacteria rich.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as you go down lower,
you've got more fungi.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why adding more, you know,
bacteria rich compounds throughout the
[SPEAKER_05]: time to make sort of a calm cold
composting in your in your soil beds is a
[SPEAKER_05]: great idea because then in time that
bacteria top layer is going to turn into a
[SPEAKER_05]: fungi rich lower layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can add anything hard and
you're going to get more carbon,
[SPEAKER_02]: more sticks, you know, a little stick,
maybe stocks from your previous harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could work into the top part of your
soil or even adding for, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: pre-made soil of people that have indoor
adding sawdust to your, to your soil is
[SPEAKER_05]: great as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when you're having a premixed
soil or some wood chips, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: deciduous, because then you're not dealing
with the acidity, but it, but if it's
[SPEAKER_05]: really old and the acidity, you know,
goes away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's a whole other conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, something which kind of,
I think is an overall topic of this whole
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thread is, and I've seen you
reference it on a few different YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: videos is kind of this conundrum of
organic certification, organic labels,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just that the whole,
the whole, I think it's like, it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: minefield these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, are you happy to
use something which is not strictly
[SPEAKER_00]: organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: So long as you're confident, it's kind of
beneficial in some way or another.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of people and a lot of
farmers out there in the world that don't
[SPEAKER_05]: want to have anything to do with a
certification, even if they're an alfalfa
[SPEAKER_05]: farmer, because they don't feel like their
regenerative practices are representative
[SPEAKER_05]: of that certification.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately it's like, there's not
many certifications.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the reason why we came up with
the peer certification is because we just
[SPEAKER_05]: felt really sort of angry, really upset
with what the commonality of what people
[SPEAKER_05]: saw as organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it had that label on it,
then, oh, that's good enough for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you start reading into it,
you know, 30% of your inputs can be
[SPEAKER_05]: non-organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's a whole list of
pesticides you can add and a whole list of
[SPEAKER_05]: herbicides and all different kinds of
things that are underneath that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like you said, yeah, it started out
like in, in the U S with the Oregon tilth
[SPEAKER_05]: and they did a really good job,
but now they can't utilize that term
[SPEAKER_05]: organic unless it's along with the USDA
organic or the Canadian organic standards
[SPEAKER_05]: and certifications.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I say it depends because it's
kind of a know your farmer situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you find yourself in the
countryside and, and you've got in your
[SPEAKER_02]: area, someone who's been farming,
you know, the certain way their whole
[SPEAKER_02]: time, and they just didn't want to go
bother going through and buying the
[SPEAKER_02]: certification and getting that kind of,
you know, validation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, I mean, we would say use that
because that farmer is probably just more
[SPEAKER_02]: radical to keep it natural than someone
who's part of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like when you're part of the
system is that you have to question it
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of really knowing your
source, you know, of where it's coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now there's been this incredible
movement of power in the peer
[SPEAKER_05]: certification because pure farmers are now
joining together and going out onto
[SPEAKER_05]: farmers plots and saying, Hey,
we'll buy all of your hay or your straw
[SPEAKER_05]: every single bit of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't spray it, and you add these
things to it, and you let all of the weeds
[SPEAKER_05]: grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now the farmer is getting a higher
price from pure farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just like sacred commerce that
creates knowing your source, you're
[SPEAKER_02]: actually creating knowing your power is
your alfalfa farmer and empowers your
[SPEAKER_02]: field farmer who may not have had a reason
to care.
[SPEAKER_02]: That person might have just been like,
Oh, you know what, the farmers,
[SPEAKER_02]: these bigger companies are just they just
pay me and then I just do it and they give
[SPEAKER_02]: me seed, I don't have to think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you might have farmers that,
you know, if they were, if they had a
[SPEAKER_02]: community of people that were like,
listen, we value you not using any
[SPEAKER_02]: chemicals on your products or on your
field, you know, we'll pay this specific
[SPEAKER_02]: price.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then farmers now have an incentive to
grow, you know, their, their, their,
[SPEAKER_02]: their alfalfa in a good way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why the pure farmers are making
an impact, not just on their farm,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, but even way farther.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we encourage the listeners to look up
DEM pure farms.com, which is a website
[SPEAKER_02]: that we've created, which highlights
closed the closed loop practices that we
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about and the farms that that do
those practices and shows those farms in
[SPEAKER_02]: the different states.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you say, is it just us on our
farm?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can see, you know, close to 80
different examples of other people doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it and in different places in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's mostly in the U S and Canada at
this moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and this certification, you know,
that we're talking about is a movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an activist movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something you can even buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't cost anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's free and it's in its community run in
that we don't decide the final,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, if somebody is looking to be
pure certified, we set the standards and
[SPEAKER_05]: we, and we sort of set it out,
but it becomes a community brain and a
[SPEAKER_05]: mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that say somebody in Humboldt is
wanting to be certified, well,
[SPEAKER_05]: all of the pure farmers in Humboldt are
the ones that go to that farm and make a
[SPEAKER_05]: decision on whether it is matching their
farm and whether they feel like it's the
[SPEAKER_05]: same standard as their farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in that it creates community and more
of a conversation so that we can all get
[SPEAKER_05]: better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that goes into your conversation about
sourcing, just right back at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's more people trying to source
the same thing, then we know exactly where
[SPEAKER_05]: we're getting it from and we know exactly
what it contains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'll just, I'll just make
the point that, you know, we, we,
[SPEAKER_02]: we love ganja and when we smoke it,
we, we feel like in harmony with nature
[SPEAKER_02]: and we have that connection of naturalness
and to be a naturalist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we, we really, it is an activist
movement to just make the impact as
[SPEAKER_02]: widespread as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that that's really what this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is really exciting and it's nice to
have something exciting in a time when,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's a lot of doom and gloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the thing which you touched
on and which appeals to me the most about
[SPEAKER_00]: the pure certification is that,
yeah, there's, there's the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: community responsibility slash aspect to
it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that that same kind of
philosophy needs to be extended to more
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the movement?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the thing which jumps to mind
to me the most is kind of the activism
[SPEAKER_00]: within say the legal sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do you think there needs to be
that same kind of onus on ourselves to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of take responsibility for the things
we want to see happen in a way?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis is not just a plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a culture and it doesn't matter where
you are on the planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, so many listeners out there and
I'm sure you would feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you could go anywhere in the
world and you're seeing somebody that's
[SPEAKER_05]: totally different from a totally different
place, from a totally different,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, whatever different age group or
different socioeconomic group or,
[SPEAKER_05]: or possibly a different race or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you have cannabis in, in common,
all of a sudden that they're a dude,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's like great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you're just like all of a sudden
friends with that person.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that that comradery and that
family energy and culture of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely needs to be in the forefront.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having a rightful voice for this plant
that has given us so much, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: when we ingest it, it gives us a,
you know, a higher understanding of nature
[SPEAKER_05]: and, and more of a community mindset.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that that community mindset is
everything that we need to be able to move
[SPEAKER_05]: forward, both in the political sector and
also all the way down to the cultivation
[SPEAKER_05]: sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and, and I will, and I will say
that this, this movement has gone,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, political and, and we do have
friends and family that are working in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to say the word politics,
but influencing laws and, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, give thanks, give thanks to
them and regulations and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and, and it's also just in,
in cafes and, and even beyond like,
[SPEAKER_02]: and midwifery is something that's really
important to us, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's just a lot of things that see
this kind of movement, this pure kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: movement as more of a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why regenerative is a word that
that's being used a lot by us in the
[SPEAKER_02]: community is because it makes sense to,
to use a regenerative lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we really do need to regenerate,
you know, we can't sustain, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: where we are in this world or in this,
in this path, we have to go beyond
[SPEAKER_02]: sustaining and regenerate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the peer certification is,
it's, it is cannabis and food based,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it goes way beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're in an international,
you know, community now.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, as perfect example, we're talking
to you in Australia is if you're here in
[SPEAKER_05]: our front room and what a wonderful
opportunity to be able to reach out to the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that cannabis needs to be seen
as, as an international now, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we all need to join together.
[SPEAKER_05]: We all need to be on the same page.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the way that we're going to be
able to have the rightful voice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I was saying before for the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that, you know, so many
investors, we call them outvestors,
[SPEAKER_05]: but just for fun, so many investors and so
many different, you know, corporations out
[SPEAKER_05]: there trying to own it, but nobody brought
a seat up for the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: In that conversation or in that conference
call, nobody is having a conversation,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, if they're in that corporate
mindset.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that as we move forward into
the rules and the regulations and into our
[SPEAKER_05]: own use and, you know, into the health and
wellbeing of, of introducing our cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: culture to the whole world, we have an
incredible responsibility to have a
[SPEAKER_05]: rightful voice for the plant and that
she's always part of our conversations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how we move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can definitely agree with all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had one question, which I was
actually struggling to think of how I was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to slide it in, but you guys just
gave me the perfect segue when you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned that midwifery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you guys have been toying
slash, you know, a hundred percent doing
[SPEAKER_00]: like a kind of pregnancy brew for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was interested in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how did that start?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, can you just give us a bit more
information about it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm a midwife and I have been in the
national health field, naturopathic
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine, herbology, Chinese medicine
since my early twenties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was, you know, mid to early
nineties.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Early, early nineties.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're still learning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the veterans are really around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to give like a lot of respect to
the veterans.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The elders.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I, I've always utilized, you know,
a beautiful tea blend and I've thought
[SPEAKER_05]: that herbs and steeping and brewing herbs
were just a really good way to get
[SPEAKER_05]: immediate results in a human condition.
[SPEAKER_05]: So any maladies that anybody had,
you know, whether it was a body wash,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is like a foliar spray, or whether
it's like in, you know, drinking it and
[SPEAKER_05]: you're drinking it for your kidneys or
whatever different things that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, utilizing herbs for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And pregnancy tea is really close to my
heart because I feel like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can take pregnancy supplements and
because it's like mined minerals and it's
[SPEAKER_05]: very difficult for your digestive tract to
understand herbs in the same way,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like pills in the form of
capsules or something like that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, like a supplement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a good whole food capsule wouldn't be
the same as a whole food, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out of your garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and then we know if you steep those
teas, then it starts to extract the
[SPEAKER_05]: minerals like overnight and you can grow a
beautiful, healthy, you know, mama and
[SPEAKER_05]: baby with, with great breast milk after
the baby is born just off of herbs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where we took that whole
ideology and started putting it into soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I had a, an old tea brew blend,
you know, I could let, I grow all of my
[SPEAKER_05]: own herbs and then give them out to all of
my friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of the ladies that I work with had one
that was a year old and the new crop was
[SPEAKER_05]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just thought, Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm, I'm just going to steep this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've always just steeped nettles and
horsetail before I'm getting a steep,
[SPEAKER_05]: this entire pregnancy brew and see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was like, as if the plants were
just screaming out the next day,
[SPEAKER_05]: like this is it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's, it's herbology for plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can help us and treat us and help us
grow and help stimulate our immune
[SPEAKER_05]: response.
[SPEAKER_05]: Through other plants, because it's
something that they understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've always had a really spiritual
connection with our gardens and with our
[SPEAKER_02]: gardening and with our wild crafting and
foraging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've always had a, you know,
a spiritual connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we, we definitely
recognized, of course, that we're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: a female plant and the female cannabis
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a natural connection to using
herbology for women to using herbology for
[SPEAKER_02]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like wild yam, which is a
feminine, you know, hormone herb,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is in our fat flowers blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why people we feel get such a
great response in their flowers and in
[SPEAKER_02]: their terpene response by using,
you know, the products in our,
[SPEAKER_02]: in our blends that we put together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or also utilizing even flowers,
you know, when you see things that are
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering, it's a great thing to utilize
in your flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a, you know, a feminine quality
to a feminine quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we utilize a lot of flowers
on our property and we suggest for people
[SPEAKER_05]: to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just been an intertwined,
you know, let's say work of life that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've intertwined, you know, the gardening
with the human health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been extremely beneficial and we
feel like it's timeless.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that doesn't go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, it's almost like it awakens
something primal inside people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they learn about it, you know,
they just want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just makes so much sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can relate to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you say you use say things like
even flowers from other plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: teas, is that kind of like the more
terpene rich, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I asked this is because
I've got this frangipani tree in my
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard and it smells so much and it
drops so many flowers on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been looking at it for so long
going, I need to make a ferment out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I think it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just taking all of those terpenes
and then making them totally usable for
[SPEAKER_05]: your microbiology and then uptake into
your plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And frangipani.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a big whiff of it go through my
body when you said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing is as far as, you know,
fermenting it and extracting that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: really kind of two ways to ferment
biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's good to touch on it,
which is, you know, using sugar to extract
[SPEAKER_02]: it and make a concentrate with the biomass
or using, let's say, water and doing more
[SPEAKER_02]: of an herbal juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've we've touched on this in this
in this in this discussion already.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we really we really prefer the juice,
the water version as opposed to the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does depend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you may live in like in your area
near sugar cane or some kind of like sweet
[SPEAKER_02]: crop or something that you can use sugar
really easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might be a crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might make a lot of sense in your area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once again, you know, farming is a bio
regional thing and it really you can't say
[SPEAKER_02]: one thing for all areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in a lot of our areas in the northern
hemisphere, you know, sugar doesn't do
[SPEAKER_02]: well, you know, up here doesn't grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in our bodies, it's it's like a hot
it's a hot thing that goes through our
[SPEAKER_02]: body and it burns out quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't really want to use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not good for our health.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when extracting with sugar,
and when it doesn't come from our area,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really want to try and make a tea
that's from our area, which empowers us to
[SPEAKER_02]: not have to bring something from far away
and using water and just chopping up your
[SPEAKER_02]: herbs and putting herbs in water and
letting them ferment and juice,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, with the lactic acid bacteria,
mother culture and fermenting it and juice
[SPEAKER_02]: and then straining it out and activating
it is our favorite way to extract biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what Josh means by juice is the
natural plant sugars that are already
[SPEAKER_05]: present in the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, also the reference to hot,
you know, sugar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sugar is something that when you eat it in
your body, it creates immediate energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The energy is quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fast.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, as we all know, that's why
people call it a sugar high, because
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a downside to the sugar high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And microbiology has that same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you add a whole bunch of sugar to
your tea brews, it's going to spark an
[SPEAKER_05]: immediate microbiological like effect that
then burns out very quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe sugars are okay to add tiny,
teeny tiny bit to maybe start spark that
[SPEAKER_05]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you want your microbiology to be
subsisting off of the plant material and
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant sugars and the plant extracts
that are already within there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we don't use utilize sugars
in our tea brews because we really don't
[SPEAKER_05]: eat sugar in our home either.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people utilize some of these as
an extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that maybe it is a good idea if
you have an opportunity to buy a product
[SPEAKER_05]: at a store or you have an opportunity to
make your own extract and concentrate from
[SPEAKER_05]: plants that are, say, seasonal and then
you bring it to your indoor, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: operation, then that makes a lot of sense
because the more homemade things,
[SPEAKER_05]: the better.
[SPEAKER_05]: But fresh is always going to be best.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we feel like utilizing the plant
sugars over any type of processed sugar is
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also to interject here really quickly,
sugars are very different.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, evaporated cane juice is very
different than beet sugar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, you have to be very careful
what you're eating and also what you're
[SPEAKER_05]: putting in your tea brews.
[SPEAKER_05]: A beet sugar is a monosaccharide.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, your microbiology doesn't
recognize it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just starts killing things.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same within your body.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you look at a label that just says
sugar, it's mostly going to be beet sugar
[SPEAKER_05]: because that's a GMO crop that they're
producing on a mass level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it just produces a lot of candida and
yeast things within our body and also
[SPEAKER_05]: within our soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So looking up what a polysaccharide is and
the more saccharides that are in within a
[SPEAKER_05]: sugar is definitely what you're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's going to be a prebiotic to
certain types of organisms that are
[SPEAKER_05]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, cone is one thing that's coming
to our life, which is from South America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a watery tuber.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really, really sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a really, really good companion
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It aerates your soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a really good thing to use for
tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a great prebiotic and also
polysaccharide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's high in inulin as opposed to
insulin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a prebiotic for tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's all really interesting stuff,
especially with that inulin common.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking into that a little more
myself recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I wanted to ask about the
evaporated cane sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may feel like a little bit of a
redundant question, but I noticed it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: some of your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess the question is,
do you find like that's the one you would
[SPEAKER_00]: pick if you had to use one or is there
something maybe a little better?
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, for whatever reason,
you don't put that in the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, where do you sit on the sugars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, which is your personal favorite?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we put that in our product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we know the source of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the source is always really
important.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that that farm that makes that
sugar is of upstanding value.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a smaller, you know, farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good product.
[SPEAKER_05]: It contains a lot of polysaccharides.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is from cane sugar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we put a tiny bit in there just to
spark the microbiology to wake them up to
[SPEAKER_05]: then have them start eating the herbs.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's exactly what we do within our
tea brews as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you've got fresh plants,
then you're going to be having a lot more
[SPEAKER_05]: sugars that there's no need to add any
other extra sugar, because we noticed the
[SPEAKER_05]: microbiology is sparked up right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in our product, there's dried,
you know, herbs in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to spark the microbiology immediately
is a good idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you don't want them to sustain off of
the sugars, because then that's just
[SPEAKER_05]: creating yeast and fungi that's
pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The herbology that you put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The herbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we just loop back to one or two
questions ago when I was talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the onus on the community to be,
you know, more solidified in a legal
[SPEAKER_00]: sense, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to ask a few quick legal
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I guess the most kind of relevant
one to me is if you could kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: change one law or maybe a few,
which ultimately just kind of change one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing ultimately, what's the one thing
that you feel is most pertinent to get
[SPEAKER_00]: fixed or changed or whatever, you know,
set right, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, right off the bat, I would love to
see cannabis decriminalized and not
[SPEAKER_05]: legalized, because legalized means that
you're immediately going to have rules and
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations and all different kinds of
conference calls and people and money and
[SPEAKER_05]: investors and corporations and big bucks
and everything is coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really has a negative connotation.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you decriminalize something that
allows people to go on about their
[SPEAKER_05]: business and lots of herbs or,
you know, decriminalized, you can't really
[SPEAKER_05]: like go and make a whole bunch of them or
whatever, you know, say like poppy or
[SPEAKER_05]: something, you can grow them in your
garden and it's up to you as to what you
[SPEAKER_05]: want to do with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just right off the bat, that's really,
you know, radical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you mean agriculture laws?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like anything really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe maybe a better example would
be maybe something a little smaller than
[SPEAKER_00]: like a, you know, broad scale
decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, because I hear a lot of people
complain about lots of the smaller like
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of sublegalities of the legalization,
like whether it be limits on how much
[SPEAKER_00]: small producers can grow or just,
you know, like financial hurdles for
[SPEAKER_00]: certain people to get into the game,
you know, all of those types of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, capping, capping,
you know, the your farm, your canopy is I
[SPEAKER_02]: think is a great way, a great law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you don't cap, when you have
a legalization structure and you don't cap
[SPEAKER_02]: what farms can do, then you just get crazy
farms like in Canada and different places
[SPEAKER_02]: in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get these farms that are like 20 acres
and they're a million square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden, it's like,
how many million square feet companies do
[SPEAKER_02]: you need in a country or in a legalized
area?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think capping it and having more
farms is going to give more, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: ability for more farms to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really what we need is, and I think
this is a problem in a lot of agriculture,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the corporatization of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mass scale of it all, I think we
need a lot of smaller farms producing more
[SPEAKER_02]: intentional products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that capping it would be
one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing with with as far as
agriculture laws and organics goes,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would like to see organic mean
absolutely no chemicals used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another one, plastic mulch not allowed
plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not allowed with organic farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, every single year you're going to
throw away your plastic mulch because you
[SPEAKER_02]: can get your zucchini out two weeks
earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your strawberries out a month earlier.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you say that, are you
referring to kind of like that shredded
[SPEAKER_00]: poly pipe stuff or more of like just a
general plastic cover type of thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a poly pod we don't agree with
either.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a sheet of plastic that goes over the
ground that people utilize for weed
[SPEAKER_05]: control.
[SPEAKER_05]: It burns out any kind of weeds and seeds
that are there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, of course, it's going to burn
out a tremendous amount of microbiology.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also it makes the soil warmer in a lot
of regions so that you can push a crop
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier, earlier, earlier harvest out of
it and it keeps the moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's tractors that have, you know,
giant rolls of plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I know people have to acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their organic farmers have acres of earth
covered in black plastic that's covering
[SPEAKER_02]: their mounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every year they throw it away.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is like this is the majority of
the U.S.'s, you know, 88 percent of the
[SPEAKER_05]: organic market in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: comes from California alone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then like over 90 percent of that
comes from like the Salinas County and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, all of that area and region.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of that is covered in black
plastic and they can still put an organic
[SPEAKER_05]: standard on it and they can use glyphosate
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I remember you specifically
referencing, Kelly, was in one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: talks I saw on YouTube, you mentioned that
there's an increasing amount in terms of,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, your percentage or composition of
your products, which can like be kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: ambiguously labeled or just blatantly not
organic, but still gets that label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that that, for example,
is kind of like the ultimate nail in the
[SPEAKER_00]: coffin for organic certifications and
labeling?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because you'll get farms that use
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Omri is something in America that
people use in North America.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they will use a product that's
registered and then they'll find out that
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't even what was on the label.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was something that was a carrier in the
product, in the liquid that maybe makes
[SPEAKER_02]: their product fail in a test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that's kind of your big problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, you know, the fine print,
you know, will say that this product is
[SPEAKER_05]: registered for use in organic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not saying that it is organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: The language that is utilized is utilized
and geared towards big ag, no matter what
[SPEAKER_05]: country that you're on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Department of Ag, the EPA, whatever your
standardization names are, they're all
[SPEAKER_05]: under the same umbrella.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's big agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big agriculture makes up those rules and
regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're the ones that have all the way
down to the labeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you would not believe we need to
change our labels for every single state,
[SPEAKER_02]: like practically every other month because
because they can see toxicity levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and they continue changing the
labels.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's a big problem for us.
And that's why we need to change our
labels.
We need to change our language.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can no longer utilize the term healthy
on any of our labels because the term
[SPEAKER_05]: healthy implies that you have used a
pesticide on the pesticide list.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have a pesticide, then you can
say this pesticide will bring health to
[SPEAKER_05]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've taken away that ability for us
to be able to use language in a way that
[SPEAKER_05]: is actually educational.
[SPEAKER_05]: Labels are not education.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to look further than labels to be
able to get our education because they're
[SPEAKER_05]: out there trying to trick us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of looking further is,
you know, when you get organic liquid
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizers of any kind, liquid itself is
a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have some type of stabilizer
within that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a preservative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that preserves it in order for it to
not explode on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's not exploding on the shelves,
then how much is it really doing for your
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiology to begin with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because microbiology has to live or it
dies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So different things that preserve liquid
are a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Phosphoric acids and different things that
can be in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to be you have to be a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be aware of of the companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's even different things and
sprays and foliar sprays that that are in
[SPEAKER_02]: the in there that are not on the label
that can be a toxic residue on your plants
[SPEAKER_02]: later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we use only powders in our
products, because then we put the power in
[SPEAKER_02]: the farmer's hand to make liquid out of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're not and then we have
everything in glass and not in plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no plastic garbage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we encourage people, you know,
to grow your own biomass and not buy our
[SPEAKER_05]: products.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the ultimate goal is that
everybody is closed loop and that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: creating your own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: And wow, that is just like the best middle
finger in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: To Big Ag, there's no more power than we
have than to grow our own seeds and
[SPEAKER_05]: propagate our own vegetables and our own
medicine on our farm with the nutrients
[SPEAKER_05]: that we grow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we just kind of reference the
comments you made about encouraging people
[SPEAKER_00]: to close the loop, where do you ultimately
see Dragonfly Earth medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: If that were to happen, for example,
let's just say, you know, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: substantial number of pure farms and,
you know, we had reached that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you would you kind of launch
Dragonfly as, you know, like a slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different direction at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think there would still be a
need for it in the way it currently
[SPEAKER_00]: operates, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, Dragonfly, I guess a lot
like the species, we're just all over the
[SPEAKER_05]: place.
[SPEAKER_05]: We feel like education is number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, we're farmers first.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we came up with our products after we
were farmers for 20 years, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then then the education started
sparking out because we came out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: closet and we realized wow, we're doing
things really different than everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: else because we had to hike, you know,
seven hours out into the bush or a two
[SPEAKER_05]: hour hike straight up the mountain,
you know, from our property.
[SPEAKER_05]: We weren't able to bring anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because we didn't share with other
community cannabis members or anything,
[SPEAKER_05]: we didn't know that we were that
different.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we came out of the closet,
we started thinking, wow, this is actually
[SPEAKER_05]: really unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we maybe have something to share with
the rest of the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it turns out that people all over the
world are hungry for this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not even really that we're
teaching people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just reminding our basic human
instinct of our relationship to the Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as Dragonfly and Dragonfly
Earth medicine in the world, and as we're
[SPEAKER_02]: really proud of our products and they do,
we feel like they'll always have a place
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's always going to be someone
on Earth or in a place that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't live near biomass or even farms
that we work with will use, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the products because it makes a really
quick and nice and easy tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's safe and it's easy and the plants
respond to it right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see our products as timeless.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have human health products as well,
you know, our Roca-Cal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that part of our and we've never
taken, you know, we've never done
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing with any of our business either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've taken this unique stance of
showing a lifestyle and having,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, products as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will always be connecting with
farmers in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, I think, our true love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our true love is homesteading and working
with raw materials and building and doing
[SPEAKER_02]: timber framing or midwifery.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's home birth or gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on that level, we always want to
expand with that kind of direct contact
[SPEAKER_02]: with farmers.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end of the day, you know,
if the business fails and, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it all goes to hell in a hand basket,
we're just going to be humble farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: because that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll be helping catch babies and we'll
be humble farmers because that's our true
[SPEAKER_05]: love.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everything else is sparked off of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that'll happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing I did want to specifically
inquire into is will there ever be a point
[SPEAKER_00]: where, you know, dragonflies seeds will be
commercially available for people to buy?
[SPEAKER_05]: An interesting question about seeds is
that the answer is we don't know because
[SPEAKER_05]: we've been giving away our seeds and we
give them away to people that we see.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we never felt like you could put a
monetary number on a seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really interesting that it
involves ethics.
[SPEAKER_05]: It involves, you know, getting it out
there to the public.
[SPEAKER_05]: It involves exchange between two people.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much, you know, with seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's sort of the essence of all of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've always just given them away.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't really know what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've just been breeders because that's
part of our closed loop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're breeders because we didn't have
tests, you know, and facilities to be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to tell us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we went off of smell.
[SPEAKER_05]: We went off of how it made you feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we've been breeding for almost 25
years now off of what it means made us
[SPEAKER_05]: feel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now those genetics are being tested
and they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a really beautiful, you know,
focus on intuition than matching science.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe the intuition was always right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I'm going off of subjects here with
the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've definitely, you know, like we've
seen our seeds grow in a lot of different
[SPEAKER_02]: environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've gotten a lot of feedback from
people that have gotten our seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there really is a really strong vigor
that goes through the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like the first ones to pop and
they'll be, you know, big leaves and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, what we can say is we will
always breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always will be making seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it does become available to the world,
it's because all of a sudden there's this
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy world demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for now, it's just a labor of love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyone who comes in contact with us,
we are pretty damn generous about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it just feels good to exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we kind of look at your specific
situation, I know that you guys do all
[SPEAKER_00]: your breeding outdoors and you don't use
clones or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our viewers had submitted the
question of wanting to know, do you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like that makes your breeding a little
harder in the, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: sorry, I keep saying, you know,
it's such a pet peeve of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically they were wondering,
do you feel like it limits you in that
[SPEAKER_00]: because you've got a male outside there's,
say, you wanted to do a few different
[SPEAKER_00]: projects, you may not be able to do as
many as you wanted because you have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: mindful of, you know, the pollen may carry
and we only want to do so many and not
[SPEAKER_00]: risk having too many males around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something which ever goes through
your mind or is it's just not actually
[SPEAKER_00]: like that in reality?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we feel like the best breeding is done
in nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just been proven, you know,
to do fast cycle breeding is not something
[SPEAKER_05]: that we want to do because we want to see
the full expression of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to see it from seed all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do take cuttings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes we do take a cutting off of like
if we have a bunch of plants and we're
[SPEAKER_05]: growing them out long season and we've got
one that's like, oh, my goodness,
[SPEAKER_05]: this one is so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have to keep it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We won't even think about keeping it until
the very end, maybe when we're harvesting
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so that will be like an
extenuating circumstance.
[SPEAKER_05]: But some of our breeding has come off of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But long season, you know, when we call it
an F1, it's a true F1.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a full year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, for sure, you know,
if you're going to start a genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: company, you know, I wouldn't I wouldn't
necessarily do it the way we did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're doing it because,
yeah, you could get, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could stabilize a strain, you know,
technically, you know, by, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it five or seven, you know,
generations, which no one does.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but, you know, so, yeah, we've gotten
to 12 and it's still not stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to start a genetics
company, you know, you can get a lot more
[SPEAKER_02]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will say this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, our breeding is a labor of love
and it's an expression of ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and we think that there is
an incredible amount of strength that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes from breeding underneath the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and we've we've grown seeds from other
people that grow underneath the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've seen that within other people's
genetics as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we feel like there's an
incredible vigor that comes from growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: from creating seeds outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we we put a lot of intention into,
you know, choosing the right male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we grow that male outside,
you know, all the way out until the very
[SPEAKER_02]: end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we bring it inside like the room
of our house in order to keep the pollen
[SPEAKER_02]: from going all over the property.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, we we we think that it's a good
way to breed because we've seen a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: good results from it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when you get our seeds and our
genetics, it's a full expression of our
[SPEAKER_05]: microbiome here on our farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a full expression of the flowers and
the plants that we grow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's probably why the
seeds are so healthy, because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly an increasing demand,
I should say, for seeds produced by
[SPEAKER_00]: growers slash breeders who are breeding
in, you know, as much of an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: environment as possible, because you can
kind of see, you know, the seeds come out
[SPEAKER_00]: really healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to ask one other quick
question about in regards to you said if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's if it's a keeper, you know,
you want to hang on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that I mean, I guess the implication
is you re-vege it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that that re-veging process is
detrimental at all or not not after you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got it back to where it needs to be?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we haven't seen that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a really, really beautiful,
healthy plant can definitely produce a
[SPEAKER_05]: healthy clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zellie's Gift is a plant that we cloned in
2014, and it's still going really strong
[SPEAKER_02]: for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the initial stages of cloning,
you know, a flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the Zellie's Gift, we cloned it
the day we harvested it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then these were big plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were like, you know, 10,
10, 12 foot plants that we're that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the inside part of the plants,
there's a lot of, you know, inner branches
[SPEAKER_02]: that will leave some of those inner
branches on the inside part of the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: during the flowering phase and not we
won't clear out everything in there just
[SPEAKER_02]: in case we do find a plant that's just
like amazing and then we can clone it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like you're cloning like a
bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're cloning like an inner
branch that has less of a bud head on it
[SPEAKER_02]: and has a little bit more leaf matter on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be, you know,
way more likely to re-vegetate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to have a little bit more
patience with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not going to be like a
typical clone that you're getting off the
[SPEAKER_02]: end of the meristem, you know,
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, you know, you can get a clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've noticed we've gotten clones before.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if we put them in a full outdoor
cycle, then it really rejuvenates the
[SPEAKER_05]: clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so many of our our genetics are
getting either watered out or we're losing
[SPEAKER_05]: the vitality of the genetics, both at the
inner breeding and also just over
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have an amazing clone that you
just love to bring it outside and let it
[SPEAKER_05]: go full season and then re-clone it,
you're really going to reinvigorate that
[SPEAKER_05]: strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've done it over and over again.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've even taken like a clone that tests
out something and then put it into the
[SPEAKER_05]: ground and had a full season and then it
tests out something totally different.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that's where we were talking
at the very beginning that microbiology
[SPEAKER_05]: does have a tremendous amount to do with
the health and vitality cannabinoid ratio,
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoid profile, terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing is, you know,
we would never grow a feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just don't believe in feminizing seeds
and we don't smoke tobacco around our
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a problem with tobacco and
people smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not healthy to have tobacco smoke
around, you know, cannabis plants in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you have to be careful
with, you know, just breeding and breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: and knowing your breeders and knowing,
you know, what kind of environment it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, being grown in because the plant
is uptaking like information as it's
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it's growing in a totally healthy
environment, the information that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: uptaking is just full happiness,
full expression, no barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a question that we kind of normally
start the interview off, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were having so much fun talking about
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your guys first introduction to
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, mine was in the formation of my seed
and creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my very creation on earth has been me
being surrounded by cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my connection was being born into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really have always felt really a
beautiful connection to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been, you know, good quality
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's always something I felt really
called to and connected with in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Josh is from Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, one of the weed capitals of
the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I need to add that so we don't forget it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, it's been, you know,
a huge part of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel really blessed to be able to
have such a, you know, to still have such
[SPEAKER_02]: a connection with it and stuff and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's multi-generational and even for,
you know, our kid too and his partner,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Snodgrass family.
[SPEAKER_05]: And my connection to it was I was
definitely not born into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Quite the opposite.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, family that believed in the Just
Say No campaign, you know, was real.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, anything outside of,
you know, copious amounts of alcohol,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, shouldn't be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I was raised in a very conservative
family, Catholic, you know, just all of
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of the pointing fingers at what to do
and what not to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I tried my very first, first joint
that worked.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I had to try it a couple of times,
but the first joint that worked was
[SPEAKER_05]: actually up on top of a mountain top
skiing back country with eight of my
[SPEAKER_05]: really good friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got high for the very first time
when I was 16 and it was a whiteout and I
[SPEAKER_05]: had to get down the mountain with all of
these amazing hotshots.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just thought, had I not been totally
baked, I would have never gotten down the
[SPEAKER_05]: mountain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So immediately I had a relationship with
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then from there, I worked in 1988 up
in Alaska and I was blessed to work with a
[SPEAKER_05]: man called Johnny Appleseed who literally
during festivals and midsummer would drop
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis seeds out of his airplane and all
of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the Matanuska Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was the original Alaskan bushed weed
that was awesome and super flavorful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he did a lot of his, you know,
cultivation practices were then what I
[SPEAKER_05]: took on later on in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was my initial introduction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just started working there almost
full time around the clock in a big
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis field when I had just turned 18.
[SPEAKER_05]: And luckily, then it's never ended.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, luckily, Kelly and I we've been
together for 25 years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got together when we were really young.
[SPEAKER_05]: 27 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we have a 21 year old son
now and we've, you know, it's just been a
[SPEAKER_02]: part of our whole entire life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's given us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we have so much respect for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel like it's given us, you know,
everything that we have essentially.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I feel like, you know, just first
being introduced to cannabis, then it
[SPEAKER_05]: opened up my eyes to the whole cannabis
culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the first time, I felt a bit of
belonging.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt like, you know, I went to my first
Grateful Dead show when I was 17 years old
[SPEAKER_05]: in 1986, Alpine Valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was immediately around all of that
culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the first time, I felt family.
[SPEAKER_05]: So not only has cannabis given me a
tremendous amount of education and health,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's also given me family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an amazing answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a quick little side point that may
upset some of my close friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you agree that the dead fell off in
like 90, 90 onwards, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_05]: The dead fell off when Jerry died.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's just that's when we moved up
to Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you say the dead, the dead off in
90, that means that you love Brent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, really, you should love Brent
because there was like a fire that
[SPEAKER_02]: happened within the band when Brent was
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just a real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had a lot to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a lot to do with crosstops and
really strong LSD as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, as as the drugs changed,
things changed as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as the culture of traveling and
being like what the dead represented,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was more than music.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for sure, that did nothing happen
to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It only got, you know, more more strong
and all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would have never moved to British
Columbia if it wasn't for Jerry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, I was able I made my way
through university.
[SPEAKER_05]: By swinging kind buds at dead shows.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's how it all happened for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I have a double major in university and
almost a master's because, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis gave me that at a very young age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you have any of the kind of how
should I say, like deeply meaningful
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences, which so many people say they
have had at the dead shows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it, as you said, more of just like
a welcoming community and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's no other church.
[SPEAKER_05]: And having Jerry just going off and the
whole crowd elevating a foot off of where
[SPEAKER_05]: they're standing and every single person
having an unbelievable group experience of
[SPEAKER_05]: total oneness.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I have yet to experience that at
any other place.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, that goes into all of our
psychedelic use that we have taken on
[SPEAKER_05]: throughout our adult life as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, all of them very important,
but there was something about sharing that
[SPEAKER_05]: experience and that high with the same
like minded people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's nothing more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had the most mind blowing,
you know, transforming experiences at
[SPEAKER_02]: Grateful Dead shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just goes into the parking lot
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was camping afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and there was no Internet at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people weren't just like buried into
their their phones and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, they were buried.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buried into like their each other and
hacky sacks and guitars and drums and drum
[SPEAKER_02]: circles and disco buses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you would get to like know
people and you would hear about people,
[SPEAKER_02]: communes and people living a certain way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would you know, is the most
amazing thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the Grateful Dead family are
still really, really close with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're really blessed to have a close
relationship with a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They live in Eugene and in Oakland and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a lot of respect for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge amount of love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big love to the Mary Pranksters and and
Mountain Girl and every everything that
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole family has done and still they
still rock our community with love.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are our elders.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are our elders.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when we were saying at the
beginning, you know, we really don't feel
[SPEAKER_05]: like we're elders in this community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the real elders.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are the ones in their mid 70s that,
you know, helped bring this plant forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Mountain Girl, she wrote one of
the first cannabis books out there that
[SPEAKER_05]: are totally relevant, you know,
the primo plant today.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those are our real, you know,
teachers and guides that have helped us
[SPEAKER_05]: catapult forward to then catapult into the
next generation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to say, wow, it's been a
minute since I've heard of the Mary
[SPEAKER_00]: Pranksters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess with that all being said,
at what point did you kind of have the
[SPEAKER_00]: initial thoughts to start Dragonfly and
what was the ultimate catalyst?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we we moved to another country in 98
and lived the way that we lived for a
[SPEAKER_02]: really long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got we became citizens of this
country through doing imports from
[SPEAKER_02]: Indonesia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that we started transforming out
of that after, you know, a while and
[SPEAKER_02]: started feeling like we really wanted to
do a service, you know, to the earth and a
[SPEAKER_02]: service that really represented our
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it became, you know, and by 2007,
we we formed Dragonfly Earth Medicine as a
[SPEAKER_02]: representation of our lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that also is a representation
of our direct, you know, of our recipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was the first time that we were able
to share our recipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it didn't start out that we just had
Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: It started out that we were just making a
ton of stuff for all of our friends.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they were getting it from us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And oh, my God, you guys, that was so
amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, teaching them how to grow
it and then them drying it out and then,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, taking all of the different
herbal concoctions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it really became about sharing
our recipes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're working on a book now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been several years working on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just getting bigger and bigger and
bigger because there's so much
[SPEAKER_05]: information.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is it's really that same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's sharing the recipes of our life
and of our cultivation practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so something which a lot of people
have asked us questions about is your
[SPEAKER_00]: recent trip to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you referenced it earlier,
but I wanted to do a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured we'd kind of dedicate a little
block to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, what was the I guess,
you know, the inspiration to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica trip?
[SPEAKER_02]: The inspiration was we had been reached
out to by certain parts of the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they took to come to
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: To come out and to to collaborate with
them and work with them on their project.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they were needing, you know,
some help and some some ideas and some
[SPEAKER_05]: changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wanted to make changes to become,
you know, more closed loop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had been asking us for,
you know, maybe a whole year to come out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we finally said, yeah, OK,
we'll do it now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just sort of how it all began.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was an opportunity for us to bring
together our community and theirs and for
[SPEAKER_02]: us to learn from their community and from
us to and for us to teach them,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, from our community, you know,
things that we had learned and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was we felt like it was a really
beautiful information exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you got there, what were kind
of the first or I shouldn't say what the
[SPEAKER_00]: first like what were some of the initial
styles of gardening slash principles slash
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies, however you want to
classify it, what were the main tools you
[SPEAKER_00]: used when you were kind of revitalizing
the land?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from from a third from like an
outside of point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like you were using kind of,
you know, the use of IMO, some kind of KNF
[SPEAKER_00]: style principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how you would describe it or how
would you describe what you did
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, it's the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just go into an area and you just try
to figure out doing a lot of really good
[SPEAKER_02]: practices on the property and building
soils and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we got there, we were able to,
you know, continue the work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and connect more with the surroundings
and, you know, using a chipper was a big
[SPEAKER_02]: part of it, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just seeing what was available in and
around the property and what it is that
[SPEAKER_05]: they had available.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we had talked to them at the
beginning and they had gotten a chipper,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and we just started,
you know, talking about, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: what type of ratios of chipping that you
can utilize.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, within two to three days,
we had massive piles of soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: That we just planted directly into.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's amazing how when you just utilize
what is there around you, it's great to go
[SPEAKER_05]: to the tropics, too, because it's a whole
different like reality of what we deal
[SPEAKER_05]: with up here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But really, it's the same in that you just
look at the biomass that's available.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's not like a lot of earthworms
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when you go to tropical
climates, you're you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_05]: massive amounts of microbiology.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, tropical regions, you know,
rejuvenate themselves so quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, jungles are just eating
themselves and regrowing themselves,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, so quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in Jamaica really has like that jungle
feeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the microbiology is so much,
you know, finding indigenous
[SPEAKER_05]: microorganisms is like they're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: You put something down on the ground,
you add a little bit of water to it,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's going to disintegrate within a
day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what kind of things could you lay out
on top of the ground that could become
[SPEAKER_05]: soil really quickly?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just sort of got into the brain of
the microbiology there and went.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I mean, for example,
I think a regular bale of peat moss like a
[SPEAKER_02]: four cubic yard bale of peat moss is like
seventy dollars or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like some crazy amount of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really can't take the mentality of,
oh, I'm going to make soil for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a ganja garden or something or
buy from the store type thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you could get a bale or have
a couple of bales and then you might maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: want to like, you know, extend that as
much as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing is that we started digging
around on the property and saw other areas
[SPEAKER_02]: on the property that were dug out from
greenhouses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started realizing, you know,
on the on the property, what parts of it
[SPEAKER_02]: had really good deposits of earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was, I mean, I mean, like soil
usable soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it was kind of like clayish and
and and had like a tendency to want to
[SPEAKER_02]: bind together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so what we did is we just would take
wheelbarrows of that and just start mixing
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you know, with the biomass that we
were collecting from different places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were basically aerating it,
aerating it with biomass and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was it was a hands on collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we walked around with, you know,
with the people from the friends from the
[SPEAKER_02]: village.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and we really connected with white
vegetation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, was good to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would reach our hands into the
ground and see what kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: dirt there was on earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would see how we could bring that
up and propagate it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that that was our you know,
that was how it started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we first got there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an example of really a lot of the
island being full of a lot of clay,
[SPEAKER_05]: very hard stuff to be able to work with
and just getting out of the mindset that
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to go in the ground, you know,
that you can come up and out of the ground
[SPEAKER_05]: and that soil is available everywhere you
look, because things grow so voraciously
[SPEAKER_05]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the same as in Australia,
there's so many northern regions and areas
[SPEAKER_05]: that things are just growing so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is your soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we start looking at what is above
is below, then it just makes it really
[SPEAKER_05]: easy to adapt a garden very quickly,
even if you don't understand the
[SPEAKER_05]: surroundings or you don't even know the
vegetation.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some really pertinent points there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I personally noticed from the
images that I saw on your Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, was that the soil itself
didn't look all that aesthetically
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasing, especially if you come from like
an indoor setting where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks all nice and homogeneous.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you couldn't deny it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what you said, you know, they're
planning straight into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no issues, all that type of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I ultimately am interested in though,
is how do you think that soil would have
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately compared?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you think that it was kind of
like you are making the situation work,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the same time, there's kind of,
you know, a bit of a honest truth that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe it's not going to perform
as well as the peak, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: given the situation, the cost,
all the rest, it's clearly the superior
[SPEAKER_00]: option.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's definitely clearly the superior
option, no matter what, even if I had
[SPEAKER_02]: available soil to be buying from the
store, what we were making on that land
[SPEAKER_02]: was absolutely superior.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, if you look at the whole
island of Jamaica, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of different kinds of soil
on the island.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's red soil, there's black soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's hard soil and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is extremely dependent on where you
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is amazing, you know, when you go
to even Hawaii and different places,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, there's the red dirt is an
incredible dirt that grows, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: plants amazingly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, you can't really go on visual.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you really need to have in there once
we, what we say all the time is just
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that's how we're aerating the
soils and that's how we're attracting more
[SPEAKER_02]: worms.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't, there was worms around,
but there wasn't a ton.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were trying to like just gather them
from wherever we found it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you find that they're not the big
digesters, you know, of soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: The big digesters is the microbiology in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the soil that we were digging up and
the soil that we made, we made a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: batch of soil, you know, within the first
week that we were there and planted seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: that we brought in that soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we had gone on some other
farm tours and went around and,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we got to see those seeds germinate
out of the soil that we made and got to
[SPEAKER_02]: see the health of the seeds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do believe that, you know,
the soil was really, really powerful and
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you just tapped on the
genetics point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question I have is because I've seen
other other people go to Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_00]: most notably Sonic Seeds UK based breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been there and done a bit of a land
race hunt type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously you would have been exposed
to different genetics on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you see when you were there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of what people say is like,
it's a lot of really a climatized Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff from years gone by and that the
general consensus is there's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: any pure land race anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as like climatized, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, we didn't really see too many
climatized patches, you know, they're all
[SPEAKER_05]: really short.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's even an eight week can be
flowering out in five weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It forms the tiniest little bud on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's not something that's,
yeah, it's all hybrids that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: have a lot of maybe the high Himalayan
cold climate, Northern Cali or European
[SPEAKER_05]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of California
influence in there for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's, you know, I'm not,
I have no idea about percentage wise and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but I would say that we found with
the Jamaican farmers that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were very similar to any one of us
who really want the best flavor and the
[SPEAKER_02]: newest genetic and the newest,
you know, best crystals and hash making
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So over the years they've met people and
people have come to the island and they,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, would be gifted or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what you find when you go to the
farms is a lot of small plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are mostly hybrid from a lot of
years of people you know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding from other places in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really, you know, there is that
farm or that place that has land race and
[SPEAKER_02]: if they're off the beaten track and,
you know, it's really not a sought after
[SPEAKER_02]: thing on the island really because of,
you know, what they feel like they can
[SPEAKER_02]: grow now, let's say.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we felt like it was really important,
you know, that the genetics that we
[SPEAKER_05]: brought there were very thought out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we brought genetics, you know,
from Bodhi and from coastal seeds and Bob
[SPEAKER_05]: Henpil, you know, that were climatized
that were more like Thai varieties that we
[SPEAKER_05]: know that maybe they could start
interbreeding and trying to find,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, a biologically intelligent,
tall, long flowering because anywhere
[SPEAKER_05]: around the tropics, you know, it's a 1212.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the genetics that we,
you know, search for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in our realms is that, you know,
two month, eight week plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you're there, you know,
you put out a really small plant and
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately just starts flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not going to be able to,
number one, it's not going to reach the
[SPEAKER_05]: full potential.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, waste if you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_05]: We saw, you know, whole fields of just
like knee high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's because these these plants don't
have the intelligence of a 1212 cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have the intelligence of an
equatorial you know, region either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So get a really sweet producing sativa
that does take longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes their plants, you know,
bigger and nice and really expressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, that's so that was a big
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we went and talked a lot about
breeding and went and talked to a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of open breeding happening
by a lot of farmers where, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just let, you know, a few males,
you know, pollinate gardens in certain
[SPEAKER_02]: areas and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that is a really good way of
breeding from from their point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it gets a lot of different flavors and
their flavors are all, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they get through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sell them and do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's so it works in that
climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when on the island itself,
if you had to take a guess, does kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana make up a large part of the
economy or it's relatively a smaller part
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is it a big thing for them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, back in the 80s, it was huge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, they were cutting out
swaths of jungle and landing, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: big airplanes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of that, you know,
ganja was brought out all over Europe,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially UK and Holland and all of that,
and then turned into hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so there was a really huge economy
for, you know, weed growers on that
[SPEAKER_05]: island, because not only did they have the
culture of weed, but they also had the
[SPEAKER_05]: know how how to grow it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were already growing,
you know, pretty large amounts of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for them to be able to expand was
really easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now they're seeing the same thing as
the whole cannabis industry, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: anywhere that it's been legalized.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, with legalization comes
regulations that then make it really
[SPEAKER_05]: difficult to be able to have an economy
off of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now all of a sudden through
legalization, you know, they're keeping
[SPEAKER_05]: all of their weed into her island and
there's not enough people.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, well, and they're looking to be
able to get it out for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's a whole other conversation with
pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, every for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people grow, I mean, smoke cannabis
on the island.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's it's everyone's smoke
and ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not a thing at all to worry
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's definitely a huge part of
the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not valuable on the island.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's it's valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying, you know, there's there's
farmers and they and they sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's it's it's inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, on the island type thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, you know, to make a lot of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd say it seems like cannabis is is
definitely in a really big transformation
[SPEAKER_02]: in on Jamaica because of of legalization,
like Kelly said.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with legalization is becoming
international.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, farming is what you're starting
to see on Jamaica and other countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Jamaica's big, you know,
goal around or thing in life is,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they've helped bring cannabis
culture to the world through their
[SPEAKER_02]: practices and through their love of
Rastafari and reggae music.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they want to still save their
culture and save their farms and their way
[SPEAKER_02]: of life and growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they they do want to see legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to see legalization, meaning a bunch
of international companies coming in and
[SPEAKER_02]: using their island to grow a bunch of
weed, like, say, for example, Canadian
[SPEAKER_02]: companies could potentially are are,
you know, working in Jamaica right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of weed on Jamaica really to be
valuable has been exported over the years,
[SPEAKER_02]: even in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that export market is now
transforming to a legalization market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think that there's a
there's a cultural thing at stake there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they really want to save their
culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's also a health stake there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so these large can't corporate
cannabis are coming to the island.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, not to spread doom and gloom,
but to give people an education out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We think that it's totally imperative once
it becomes federally legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there's a play in the international
market with all other federally legal
[SPEAKER_05]: countries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden now it becomes
pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be really easy for large
pharmaceutical companies to to to partner
[SPEAKER_05]: with large cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those large cannabis companies not
even grow the cannabis because they'll get
[SPEAKER_05]: cheap.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheaper cannabis with the labor and also,
you know, the dollar exchange in Jamaica
[SPEAKER_05]: or say in Colombia, you know, the cut
flour market is a huge industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now the cannabis big corporate
cannabis is starting to have massive
[SPEAKER_05]: takeovers in Colombia and in Brazil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, most of the farms we visited in
Jamaica, even, you know, ones that were
[SPEAKER_02]: like roots farms that have been growing
for a long time, had been visited by these
[SPEAKER_02]: international companies that we're
talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this is happening now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go there this winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as of us going there this winter,
all the farmers have been visited by
[SPEAKER_02]: international companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's that's a that's kind of a
generalized statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's that's what we found is that
they've been and they want to make deals
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they and they say that, you know,
they don't care how it's grown and other
[SPEAKER_05]: countries don't have the same restrictions
with pesticides and with fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_05]: with herbicides and fungicides and on and
on so that it opens up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it opens that they either irradiate it
or they say they're going to wash it with
[SPEAKER_05]: petrochemical solvents.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they think that they're washing
out all of, you know, any pathogens or
[SPEAKER_05]: purities that are on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really big conversation.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this could be a whole other
podcast that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, the exact same thing is
happening in Australia in regards to the
[SPEAKER_00]: international, you know, kind of companies
moving in and doing their bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something I would love to ask first,
though, is do you think part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: problem arises from the increasing demand
from the consumer market for concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: or products which derive from concentrates
and thus, you know, there's maybe not
[SPEAKER_00]: demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for example, the stat I heard was that
something like 50 percent of all cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: sales in the States are related to like
vape pens or cartridges or like something
[SPEAKER_00]: along that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's true, it just goes to show,
yeah, like there's just an exponential
[SPEAKER_00]: growth in the demand for these cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you think that's a problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it facilitates, you know,
like just these kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: shady concentrate deals going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's that's a whole other
conversation, too, as far as like
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrates and the cleanliness of
concentrates and the importance of the
[SPEAKER_05]: cleanliness of concentrates, because it's
not just a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually has the name of what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're literally concentrating everything
that's in that flower, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So utmost respect for cultivation
practices all the way through is
[SPEAKER_05]: imperative.
[SPEAKER_05]: For concentrates and then to look at your
other question about taking over the large
[SPEAKER_05]: market is that, you know, now that
pharmaceutical companies are going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: entering into the cannabis market,
of course, they're going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrating it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to be getting a product that
has the same exact cannabinoid ratio,
[SPEAKER_05]: no matter how or where they put it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is a way of dosaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something that they understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not, you know, it's taking it out
of sort of the organic, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: world that we know of looking at flowers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's going to be, you know,
going into different types of supplements
[SPEAKER_05]: and in all different types of,
you know, pills and caps worldwide.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's definitely going to take up the
majority of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that you're right to say that,
you know, the demand of the people to buy
[SPEAKER_02]: oils is is part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's driven, you know,
farms to make concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a convenience thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not as smoky and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you find when you talk to
dispensaries and you talk to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's the, you know, the people that are
buying in the dispensaries, they want
[SPEAKER_02]: something super easy that they can drive
around in their car with and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is an ease that comes to,
you know, having a pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre rolls is another thing that sells,
you know, really, really well in
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries, which I think is another
thing of ease.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just easy to get pre rolls
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's always a better high,
I think, in a lot of ways to have like the
[SPEAKER_02]: full flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that from a farmer's point of
view, I think it's almost good with the
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates in a way because you don't
have to grow all clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow, you know, a bunch of seeds,
seed plants and have different varieties
[SPEAKER_02]: and then do batches of your flower and
make a good oil batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be all of that,
you know, number and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So number of cannabinoids and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, it's, it's kind of an amazing
question, you know, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: on which one came first, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what do you think then is the
necessary steps for us as either a
[SPEAKER_00]: community or just as a scene, so to speak,
to get things back on track.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think that it's a knee jerk
reaction to say, just try to push people
[SPEAKER_00]: to go back to flower?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the most important thing that we
can push people to is know your farmer.
[SPEAKER_05]: The most important thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Understand where your flowers are coming
from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Understand where, you know, what
dispensary that you want to go to,
[SPEAKER_05]: what breeder that you're working with,
you know, really finding out and
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding their practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And extraction company you're using,
you know, and what, so I know we're not
[SPEAKER_02]: saying everyone should only smoke flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we only smoke flower and we have
some, you know, really amazing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, extract companies that we work
with ice water hash too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, there's some really,
really good, good companies out there that
[SPEAKER_02]: do extracting and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so what we want to say is,
you know, yeah, it's totally, it's totally
[SPEAKER_02]: fine to use, but we don't, we,
as a, as a, as a certification and as,
[SPEAKER_02]: as a, as a community, we don't use any
petrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we extract our, our materials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what's really, really important
to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that customers and people that
are out there that are consumers should
[SPEAKER_02]: ask, you know, what did it come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it made from propane or butane and
then, or hexane, even that white powder
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD that you're talking about as a hexane
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are just coming from
petrochemical companies and they're just
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from, from sources that we just
don't want to be involved in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which goes back to what you were talking
about with animal products.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same reason it's the source of
what happens within the animal product
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, the source of what happens
within the petrochemical industry as well
[SPEAKER_05]: as the final product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, all things need to be looked
at.
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, you know, education is
paramount.
[SPEAKER_05]: How are we going to share education with
each other and the importance of being
[SPEAKER_05]: really open?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that hopefully dispensaries are
getting more on their game and that,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, more growers are getting more on
their game because it's really important
[SPEAKER_05]: because so many of the people that are
going to be listening to this podcast and
[SPEAKER_05]: us having this conversation, you know,
we're a different group of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: enthusiasts, of cannabis cultivators,
of cannabis, you know, business people
[SPEAKER_05]: than the other side that I'm talking about
with this massive cannabis corporate model
[SPEAKER_05]: that is the other side of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's so important to have education on
this side so that we can share and really
[SPEAKER_05]: get the message out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a bit of a doom and gloom
question, but what's your prediction for
[SPEAKER_00]: what would happen to the high end market,
so to speak, if all of the small producers
[SPEAKER_00]: were kind of pushed out, phased out,
whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what you're going to get is a bunch
of irradiated weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're going to get is you're going
to get, you're going to get basically the
[SPEAKER_02]: same thing as going and buying packaged
processed food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by pushing out the small farmer,
you're pushing out the intention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll never happen anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: There will be a reassurgence no matter
what.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now is a hard time, but a lot of the
truth soul growers, you know, already had
[SPEAKER_02]: their properties and are trying to
navigate their way through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that you're going to just like
craft beer and craft wine and craft food,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you're going to find,
you know, regions where it still works to
[SPEAKER_02]: have small farms and the small farms are
just going to have such unique flavors and
[SPEAKER_02]: such unique strains that, you know,
those, those mass produced farms will,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll never be able to produce that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the large automated farms that are
happening up in Canada are talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: being no people, there are no people grow
the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all automated.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole entire thing, the, all the
watering, all the spraying, all even the
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting is it's done like robotically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to think, I'd like to think
that, you know, the cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, has her own intelligence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why I say she is,
it's just a feminine energy plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't mean that there aren't males
and females, but you know, she will
[SPEAKER_05]: probably, I hope have the last laugh
because we're learning that the happier
[SPEAKER_05]: she is and the more grown with better
intention and in, you know, beautiful
[SPEAKER_05]: soils, she's going to produce the
well-rounded cannabinoid profile that
[SPEAKER_05]: really puts out the medicine that science
is going to soon come to.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what we as old school growers already
understand.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know what strains made you feel good.
[SPEAKER_05]: We knew what was going on already before.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we can just keep that intention
moving forward, then the voice of the
[SPEAKER_05]: plant will continue to be moving forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I just hope that the same thing
won't happen to this sentient being that
[SPEAKER_05]: has happened to tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, tobacco is a plant and it's been
taken over by corporate tobacco,
[SPEAKER_05]: but in everybody wants to maybe deem it
and say that it's bad, but it has such a
[SPEAKER_05]: sacred, amazing, special plant medicine
for the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just am hoping that through science
and through our intuitive processes,
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing it forward, that the plant will
have the last laugh and she will demand to
[SPEAKER_05]: be grown in a way that is respectful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a soulful living soil, you're going
to find more diverse cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll never be able to produce that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with all of that being said though,
do you ever foresee maybe a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: facility or operation adopting approach
similar, or maybe even the complete pure
[SPEAKER_00]: certification?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, we have this large dispense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, large facilities, you know,
green life productions in Nevada is an
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor operation that does fully no till
soils and has been expanded in a hard
[SPEAKER_02]: market and a market that's, you know,
they're one of the only organic
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators in all of Nevada.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's a lot of examples
in Colorado and Oregon, California that we
[SPEAKER_02]: work with that have adopted it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we work with really large facilities
and turning over that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the idea of just all bottled nutrients and
NPK ratios and sort of dead soil and
[SPEAKER_05]: growing plants that really don't have the
liveliness that the market is going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also we're going to be becoming
smarter as consumers.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're going to start having an
idea, you know, as a larger group of
[SPEAKER_05]: consumers of what makes us feel good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, that made me feel really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had a great day on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, oh, what was that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to start, you know,
more and more conversations for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're working behind the scenes with,
you know, facilities all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really over the last 10 years,
I mean, we've talked to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: seems like, you know, a whole hell of a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's more, you know, coming and
different states are still opening up and
[SPEAKER_02]: different places in the world are still
opening up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've always offered ourselves,
you know, for information and how to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, whether they're a pure
farmer or not, you know, they may have
[SPEAKER_02]: taken on some of the practices that we're
working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's maybe more of a
realistic end goal anyway, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If everyone could adopt most of it rather
than expecting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, you know, yeah, I mean,
once again, you know, we, we, we never
[SPEAKER_02]: claimed, you know, there's a lot of the
people make it what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all the farms are so unique and
stuff and everyone brings something unique
[SPEAKER_02]: to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's the regenerative
farm award and permaculture Institute,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, high tide permaculture,
different people that are doing amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: work on farms and, and helping people
adapt their farm to a natural cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's, it's, it's really an
amazing expansion of consciousness right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it's really amazing to be a part of
and to watch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get people, you know, emailing us
all the time that talk about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: us and this changing their life and,
and just us talking about the things that
[SPEAKER_02]: we talk about them, you know, opening
their eyes to like making changes on so
[SPEAKER_02]: many different levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been amazing, you know,
positive feedback from it and just the
[SPEAKER_05]: each one teach one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when you go out and educate a
group of people and those whole group of
[SPEAKER_05]: people are then going to educate other
groups of people that can then educate
[SPEAKER_05]: other groups of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just feel like free it up,
free up the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're never going to be those people
that are like, this is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the only way to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many different ways to do it to
where you're practicing conscious
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that, you know, any,
any way that works for you and your
[SPEAKER_05]: environment, whether it be indoor,
whether it be outdoor, how, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether you're up in Antarctica or whether
you're in the tropics or wherever you are
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivating your cannabis, just do it in a
conscious way that is going to get out
[SPEAKER_05]: better education to the people that then
utilize your product.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're the shamans of, of this
medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're affecting somebody's day.
[SPEAKER_05]: You affect their life.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could be affecting their health.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're affecting their family.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so important to have that feeling of
every single flower that you touch and
[SPEAKER_05]: every single plant that you grow,
that that is going to have an effect on
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody else's life.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what real conscious cultivation
is about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we just loop back for just two
seconds to how we were talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: automation that's going on in Canada,
kind of, you know, on that same train of
[SPEAKER_00]: thought, how do you feel about certain
types of automation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the one I'm most noticed,
most interested in is like the automated
[SPEAKER_00]: watering systems, like, you know,
the blue mat or the flora flex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if those are the brands in
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the major ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, is this a type of
technology you advocate for, or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like it's kind of removing a certain
level of connection with the plant when
[SPEAKER_00]: you say hand water?
[SPEAKER_02]: We advocate for more mulch and hand
watering.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I'm not going to say
that, you know, having one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: systems doesn't, doesn't work because it
does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can't be there and you really
want to have a garden, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: use one, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just involving more plastic into your
garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your gardens as well and how your teas and
what they're running through and all of
[SPEAKER_05]: that stuff breaks down over time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then really you think that you might
be helping yourself, but how many times do
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to fix that system and then order
out parts for that system?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, Oh God, there's a lot of
pathogens that build up in the hoses too,
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have to be careful of.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's taking away that human
interaction with the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And anyone who is out there and is a
cultivator totally understands what that
[SPEAKER_05]: is.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you can have an ailing plant or
a garden and all you do is just give it
[SPEAKER_05]: some attention by giving it good energy
and it turns everything around.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, sometimes that's not
enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course you have to go, you know,
into the deep dredges of education and try
[SPEAKER_05]: to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But oftentimes just giving good,
good energy is enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we're going to become, you know,
automated, the more and more automated
[SPEAKER_05]: that we become, the less and less that
we're having an interaction with the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is why we choose to build.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, soil the way we do, you know,
like whether it's an indoor bed and you
[SPEAKER_02]: keep, you know, wood chips in the bottom
of it to keep soil down there or you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cover the sides to keep the
humidity in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether you're outside and you use rocks
like thin rocks across the top where you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: use like a rock mulch, you know,
there's a lot of ways to keep the water in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just using, we've never used one of
those systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the reasons is it's kind of a
shallow watering, you know, water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does keep biology nice when it's
always wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, you know, there's a lot of
reasons why it can make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from our point of view, you know,
deep watering, you know, gets it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to the lower parts of the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really gives a true watering to
the root system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you start getting down into the
sub layers of your soil, that's a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: where the clay is and the minerals are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then your plant has the ability to
sort of break down those, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: when you have really long tap roots and
you're, you know, planting them into the
[SPEAKER_05]: earth, you're going to want a deep water
because you don't want your plants just to
[SPEAKER_05]: have shallow roots and then a big wind
comes along and then you're done with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, deep watering has a lot of
values more than just, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: a system or whether it's easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't use a lot of trellis,
you know, systems on our plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't, we let them blow around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the wind and having, you know,
a more saturated root system that has,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, more ability to to give its,
you know, stock strength and to give,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the lateral capillaries and the
branches, you know, more strength and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe that's why we to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have to think of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we we look at our soils and we build
our soils in a way that that we is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to enhance our watering for the season,
you know, it's it's kind of it's not just
[SPEAKER_02]: putting a soil mixture together and hoping
it's going to like hold water for the
[SPEAKER_02]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got way off track on your question,
but that's good because I got another one
[SPEAKER_00]: related to exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I wanted to know was, you know,
if you could kind of choose, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you prefer your soil to be like more of
a water retaining soil or would you prefer
[SPEAKER_00]: to water more frequently because it kind
of, you know, it's it's dries out a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: quicker.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, less frequently is better because
you're microbiology is giving a chance to
[SPEAKER_05]: be able to colonize.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you have soil that doesn't hold
any water, then when you water it,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's you're actually losing your
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're out of the bottom of your pot or
into your subsoils.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, it's really good to have
good water retention.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we believe in layers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's different layers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them are water retention layers
and some of them aren't.
[SPEAKER_05]: And another one may be rocky and another
one may be this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then the roots can make a decision,
you know, on where they are and maybe if
[SPEAKER_05]: they want some dryness that they're going
to be able to find it in a layer that has
[SPEAKER_05]: more aeration.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they want more water, then they're
going to be able to find it in an area
[SPEAKER_05]: that has more moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, your soil has to drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be a good, you know,
cation exchange and there has to be good,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, aeration in there and aerobic,
you know, qualities and breath,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in the soil and hydrogen and
carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we we we do build our soils,
though, to retain water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we think that's important because
water is a huge commodity on Earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a ton of areas that are in
drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just to react.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think anything that we can do to
build, you know, soils to save water,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if it's indoors, I think it makes all
the sense in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do think it saves your microbiology
to stay wet, but dry out all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your biology has to like wake up and go to
sleep all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't truly serve the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's your thoughts on rock dust?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering, and do you believe
there is vital to the soil as some people
[SPEAKER_00]: make them out to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know that Steve Solomon has talked
about rock dust over the years a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said that he's not seen a good
balance out of a true glacial rock dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a true balance in the stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we've always used different
rock dust that were available,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe the paramagnetic rock
dust, basalt or, you know, glacial rock
[SPEAKER_02]: dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can use a little bit of,
you know, those powders.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, you know, our our main mission
in life is to try and get the minerals
[SPEAKER_02]: from our plant life in our in our area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's so our big thing is once again,
it goes back to building soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our big thing is to try and is to think
about the trees and the different stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that we do, the ways that we can build the
soil to get minerals in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in each different, you know,
different plant species uptake different
[SPEAKER_05]: types of minerals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know that certain plants are rich
in certain types of minerals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're looking for that in your
garden, why not feed your biomass all of
[SPEAKER_05]: those minerals and then cut your biomass
down and then feed that to your garden?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because then your biomass has a long time
to be able to uptake it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the bio microbiology in the soil has
more time to uptake it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really believe in if you're going to
bring in rock dust or if you're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: bring in, you know, ocean salts or
different things that might make sense and
[SPEAKER_05]: have a lot of mineral content feed it to
your biomass rather than feeding it
[SPEAKER_05]: directly to your plants and your soil,
because then it just makes an easier
[SPEAKER_05]: exchange into your soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can get dehydrated ocean water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it has, you know, 84 trace
minerals in it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the oceans are really toxic
in the world right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd have to have a toxicity report,
you know, if you're going to use any of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And mines are are so sketchy, you know,
we really again, you need to look at from
[SPEAKER_05]: where all of the inputs are coming from.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know that we're reaching a phosphorus
ceiling right now because of rock
[SPEAKER_05]: phosphate on the planet and all of those
mines that they've totally depleted.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now all of the big ag that's totally
dependent on it, you know, and people are
[SPEAKER_05]: feeling like, oh, without it, what the
heck are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the only way that we know how to
get phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a really shitty way to get
phosphorus, truthfully, because it's being
[SPEAKER_05]: mined.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all of the people that worked out of
the mines, what kind of health problems
[SPEAKER_05]: are they having?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you just start looking at all
of it, it's like we've over thought
[SPEAKER_05]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Humans do that consistently.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just have like this big, you know,
ability to mess up stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is just a perfect example of that
we have to go and get mined material from
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere else to be able to get our
mineral content.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're building an indoor soil
from, you know, cocoa, coir and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you have to have something for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might as well get, you know,
as many different kinds of dusts as you
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that are consciously, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like glacial rock dust in our area.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's tons of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's there's tons of volcanic
ash and there's tons of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: basalt, you know, coir and, you know,
basalt that doesn't take, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: very much to create powder out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are areas where it can make
sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we and we really encourage people when
they're making these soils.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do work with people that have to
make soils from scratch as to what kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: native soil in their area can you mix into
that that's going to have all of those,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, minerals already there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it doesn't mean, you know,
you can make a soil that's intelligent
[SPEAKER_05]: enough that it will be able to unlock
that, you know, all of those minerals
[SPEAKER_05]: pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, just being conscious about where
all your dusts and things are coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be a bit of a weird
question, but it's just kind of when we
[SPEAKER_00]: were mentioning Steve Solomon,
it jumped to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Steve's got this idea that he he
thinks that you can use nutrient density
[SPEAKER_00]: as kind of like an overall parameter to
quantifiably test things on their quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think I'm right when I say
this, but I think if you asked him,
[SPEAKER_00]: he would say something like, if you got
two different bits of cannabis and you
[SPEAKER_00]: tested the nutrient density between them,
he regards nutrient density as that
[SPEAKER_00]: quantifiable kind of a parameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he says, you know, if you just
tested a whole bunch of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the one with the highest nutrient density
is going to be like the most enjoyable,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak, put aside maybe personal
preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts along those lines
or would you maybe disagree with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess maybe overall, do you think
there is like a one quantifiable parameter
[SPEAKER_00]: we can use for testing?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I think you could utilize a
lot of things, you know, as much little
[SPEAKER_05]: things that you have in your basket to
help you out along the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Little tidbits of information or little
testing things that you have along the way
[SPEAKER_05]: is great, but absolutely believe in that
idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the healthier your plant is,
the better it's going to taste as far as
[SPEAKER_05]: food is concerned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your medicine is definitely going to be
better, more terpene rich.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plant was able to fully express itself
in health.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the BRICS reading is something
that I know that he utilizes.
[SPEAKER_05]: We utilize BRICS testing here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Refractometer.
[SPEAKER_05]: A refractometer to test the sugars and
stuff in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we analyze our plants in as many ways
as possible under microscopes and leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we analyze it through pests,
you know, knowing whether your plants
[SPEAKER_02]: getting eaten by a pest is one way of
seeing whether it's healthy or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and some pests we're finding like
aphids and stuff have been attracted to
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's always an exception.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, a lot of times,
you know, a healthy plant repels pests and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the goal of it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, definitely health, health and
well-being of the plant is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at the plant and seeing it vibrate
and seeing its its leaves extended out and
[SPEAKER_02]: not constricted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, there's that's the the
the emotional touch that goes into looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of on the same topic, we
referenced it earlier and I was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it up, but I forgot to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was talking to Jeremy from Build a
Soil and he said that one thing he was
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in is that there's the
development of new organic IPM based
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them have microbes in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could look at one, say, EM5,
perfect example, you know, microbial based
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting thing about it was he was
mentioning that when people undergo
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, these same probiotics like the
CFUs, the colony forming units get counted
[SPEAKER_00]: all the same and you can fail tests
because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something which kind of is a bit
concerning to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the fact that I guess maybe we're not
able to use microbial products in an IPM
[SPEAKER_00]: remedy in that way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that there's a way around
it?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's concerning about it is the testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The testing is what's failing us.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not it's not the problem of what
we're spraying on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we're utilizing an IPFM,
we always add the F in there because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: integrated pest and fungal management
protocol.
[SPEAKER_05]: The testing is that they're not testing
the differentiation between the DNA.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they can, but it's a very expensive
test to be able to find out if it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: bacteriospore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a bacteriospore that's healthy for
you or is it a bacteriospore that's
unhealthy for you?
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're just doing a full round
spectrum of just like putting it all
[SPEAKER_05]: together in one basket.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're just saying it's all fruit,
even if it could have like 50 different
[SPEAKER_05]: species of fruit and some of them could
even be poisonous to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just saying it's all fruit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's any fruit in the basket,
then it's no good.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's any type of microbiology,
even dust spores that are perfectly fine
[SPEAKER_05]: and healthy, we breathe them in all the
time that it's gonna fail a test.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the problem is really the testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is not, so we're trying to get
smarter to the test, but this is a huge
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation in the industry right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Several states have let go of the
microbiology, the microbe counts.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what it's called, microbe counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would talk about testing a lot because
that's what the recreational scene brings
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's what farmers have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the answer is if you have a microbial
test that you have to pass, then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: fail that microbial test from using
healthy, beneficial probiotic organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the answer is you can fail your test
with those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you live in an area where you have
to basically pass the test, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to do what you have to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of people will stop spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: But is it healthy for you to use bacillus
strains and even trichoderma and other
[SPEAKER_02]: things on your plant?
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: For foliar, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: EM5, is it beneficial for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it make a better flower?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think that we've touched on
this already, but I'll say it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, our body needs to be able to
process dust and probiotics without having
[SPEAKER_02]: a sterilized product for our body.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does our immune system no good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does our health no good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those laws are prohibitive laws put in
place to make it damn near impossible for
[SPEAKER_02]: an organic farmer to do what they have to
do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it puts out the differentiation of
what is the word clean to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is clean hospital clean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it a sterile clean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because some of the worst, most horrific
diseases come out of that parentheses
[SPEAKER_05]: clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just a really interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Clean, the way that we see it,
is beneficial microbiology everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: That you're dealing with beneficial
microbiology that if a pathogen is even
[SPEAKER_05]: coming in the door at all, it can't come
in because there's totally so many
[SPEAKER_05]: beneficials that are holding it back.
[SPEAKER_05]: To us, that's clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even taunt the pathogen because
you're so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're so strong with good microbiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could taunt it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it would never be a part or come
in as a pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's a great way to kind
of, I don't know, visualize the situation
[SPEAKER_00]: or approach the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed on the site, it says you have
had a really extensive range of trialing
[SPEAKER_00]: various different mycorrhizae and
microbial products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any kind of little tips or tricks
you've learned throughout that process
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd be willing to share with us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like certain things which maybe indicate
you've got a good microbe product beyond
[SPEAKER_00]: the obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there certain things you can share
from both trial and error with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different microbial products?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's really fun to get a microscope.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really encourage people to get a
microscope.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you just learn so much when you
start to enter that world of little
[SPEAKER_05]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to be a professor or
anything like that in order to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just learn after you get the
microscope and just start seeing things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and you don't have to buy an
expensive microscope.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can buy one that is used for high
school or finishing school science class
[SPEAKER_05]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much out there and you can
actually look at the teas that you make.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can look at the soil that you're
making and also looking at the plant and
[SPEAKER_05]: what kind of reaction.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, that you said, except the
obvious, that's the most obvious is how
[SPEAKER_05]: does your plant react?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because unfortunately, these Department of
Agriculture regulations and big ag are
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be giving so much different
information.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you go on threads out there in the
cannabis world, whoa, the crazy stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: that's flying around is just difficult for
people to determine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do your own science.
[SPEAKER_05]: Learn your own ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well define your intuition in your own
gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be the best way to find
out if products are working for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can trust good companies like ours and
others that have been tried and tested
[SPEAKER_02]: through the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: The community does not stick with
companies that don't have integrity.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the companies that have been
around for a long time are around because
[SPEAKER_02]: our products have been tested by a million
different people.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many other companies out there
with beautiful integrity.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really want to highlight those farms
that are making good products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also those companies that are making good
products for the farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're out there and there's lots of us and
we're all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I so strongly agree with that final point
about the community doesn't trust brands
[SPEAKER_00]: without integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can look at that, especially
if you look at the people who are using
[SPEAKER_00]: your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's some of the most like the leaders of
the industry, but also not just the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaders, but the ones who are viewed with
integrity themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like a twofold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a big part of this culture to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just word of mouth and everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: And trusting in each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I wanted to run by you is
what's your thoughts on throwing
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae into a tea specifically before
you brew it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, I refer to it as the
Bible of organic gardening, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: teaming with microbes by Jeff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says very, very clearly in the book,
you know, if mycorrhizae doesn't come in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with a root within 24 hours,
it dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I always see people throwing
mycorrhizae into their teas and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to bubble it for presumably
at least 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, does that not all just die?
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them will become dormant and
they'll just sit in there until they reach
[SPEAKER_05]: a root if they do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really doesn't make any sense at
all.
[SPEAKER_05]: You definitely want direct contact onto
that root.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the best ways to get direct
contact is because so many of our gardens
[SPEAKER_05]: were growing fast plants and we're having
fast turnover.
[SPEAKER_05]: With cannabis plants is that your cover
crop can grow the endo mycorrhizae on it
[SPEAKER_05]: and it can propagate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you're feeding your soils,
different types of mycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure that you put, you know,
great cover crops like clover is an
[SPEAKER_05]: awesome one for so many cover crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could go on and on and they're going to
help propagate it for your cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one of the beauties of really
utilizing a lot of different species in
[SPEAKER_05]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can put mycorrhizal spores in water
and drench it into your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is an application that does work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be as good as direct
contact.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's direct contact that really,
you know, propagates the spore to come to
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we always suggest to people that if
they're going to do a tea brew,
[SPEAKER_02]: do the tea brew and then just put the
mycorrhizae in like right at the last
[SPEAKER_02]: second, right before you're about ready to
drench your gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a good application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely what I always thought
was like kind of the optimal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not grow in an aeration setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another little point I wanted to swing
by that Jeff made in one of his Verde
[SPEAKER_00]: natural talks was that he said that
there'd been some kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: newer discovery around how it was just
kind of one of the subspecies of myco that
[SPEAKER_00]: was responsible for the bulk of the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he said it was the glomerous
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know anything about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, like if so, would we not
expect all myco to switch to that one
[SPEAKER_00]: subtype essentially?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Glomocentrodysseus is the one
that's been known to be the supposedly the
[SPEAKER_02]: one that, you know, communicates and bonds
with the cannabis roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do from our point of view, I mean,
fungi is made to break the rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there are no rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the most adaptogenic thing on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to, you know, petri dishes
and science and maybe like soilless
[SPEAKER_02]: mediums and different things like that,
you know, if you're in a soilless endarm
[SPEAKER_02]: medium and you're just getting like two
months cycle or something, you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get a lot out of a two month
cycle with mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of has to live longer than that to
be truly beneficial to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, diverse microorganisms
communicate with each other in garden
[SPEAKER_02]: settings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we have four different ones
that we work with right now and we just
[SPEAKER_02]: always enhance that type of mycorrhizal
growth in our gardens just because we know
[SPEAKER_02]: that all the answers are not there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And biodiversity is so incredibly
important in your garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, being able to have,
you know, the classic endomycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, that's out there in the market
that's grown organically and consciously.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is really important, can also speak
to the other root zones that's going on in
[SPEAKER_05]: your gardens, which is just like your
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know, you know, the whole
thing of just that it's singular species.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not really sure of that yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just doesn't make sense of nature at
all.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes against all of nature's rules
where she's just like so full of
[SPEAKER_05]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is it that we're separating out and
concentrating and isolating and the more
[SPEAKER_05]: that we do that, we bring it away from its
nature, which really doesn't involve the
[SPEAKER_05]: entourage effect of everything that's
going on in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it's been proven that,
you know, that species of different types
[SPEAKER_02]: communicate with each other and share
food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a pine tree can share food with a
birch tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no like law in there that says
that they can do that, but they do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So enhancing, you know, biodiversity in
your gardens is a big part of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would want to enhance as much
different species as possible so they can
[SPEAKER_02]: communicate with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, you can just get agglomus
interdices and put it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you could just be off to the
races with that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think in life we should try and get,
you know, more dynamics happening than
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I mean, I guess the thing I'm
interested in is overall, you would kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of say that you don't think that you would
get better results from just exclusively
[SPEAKER_00]: using the one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We think that diversity is key in all
aspects.
[SPEAKER_05]: Diversity in microbiology and diversity in
nutrients is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you guys hear my cat meowing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had to make sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise I was going to go tell it to go
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, she's got a mouth on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I saw on your site,
which I was super interested in,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I am a self-professed coffee
addict.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys say that, you know, it's a bit
taxing on the adrenal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not so into it for that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys think, you know, like that
there are actually some long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: negatives, if you know, kind of bludgeon
your body with coffee over a long period
[SPEAKER_00]: of time?
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it stimulates the parasympathetic
nervous system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if your parasympathetic nervous system
is stimulated all the time, which
[SPEAKER_05]: unfortunately, you know, everything that
we do is stimulating that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: nervous system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it starts to drain the adrenals.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you give your body a full sense
of stimulant, then it starts to kick into
[SPEAKER_05]: action, you know, that all of those
different systems, which makes a
[SPEAKER_05]: depression in the immune system.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have things over a long
period of time that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: just start breaking down.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing about coffee is that it's
incredibly acidic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, if you're drinking it
often, then it's really changing the
[SPEAKER_05]: acidity of your body.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, more alkalinity,
you know, contains more beneficial
[SPEAKER_05]: microbiology than acidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're constantly acidifying your
body, then you're not only killing
[SPEAKER_05]: beneficial microbiology, but you're also
breeding pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the solution to this, well,
maybe not the direct solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, you know, instead you guys have the
cacao and mushroom kind of tea you make.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you stumble across that one?
[SPEAKER_05]: We just, you know, we work really long.
[SPEAKER_05]: By studying the ecology.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ecology has been a really important
thing in our lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been mushroom collecting for a long
time and health and wellbeing has been,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, a big part of what we do and
also incredibly long hours of work.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put a lot into, you know, our property
here on our farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put a lot into the education that we
put out to other people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put a lot into our business and we need
something that is going to work for us
[SPEAKER_05]: long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Josh and I have always been joking that
we're just in training to be 90 year olds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just want to make sure that,
you know, everything that we're putting
[SPEAKER_05]: into our body is going to have incredible
longevity.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be adaptogenic and it's
going to decide what our body needs rather
[SPEAKER_05]: than depressing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we recognize, you know, the first
thing that you drink in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, really kind of sets the tone for
your body for the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, you know, have been really wanting
to drink something really powerful and
[SPEAKER_02]: potent for our bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every morning, you know, we're drinking
the raw cacao with, you know, the
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal mushrooms in there and we're
just slowly building up our immune system
[SPEAKER_02]: with the mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day and it doesn't drop us,
you know, in, in energy levels later in
[SPEAKER_02]: the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like our secret seer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like our secret recipe and like our
secret life force is just to smoke doobies
[SPEAKER_02]: and drink cocoa all day and work on the
farm and then have a good meal in the
[SPEAKER_02]: afternoon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's like, it's like a good
way to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently we've been, you know,
making new recipes with our essential six,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is six medicinal mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And making a golden milk, which has the
turmeric, cinnamon, ginger, black pepper,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we've also fallen in love with
Moringa over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my, my kind of big secret thing,
not secret, my big, like a thing that I
[SPEAKER_02]: love lately is just Moringa, our golden
milk, the dragon fly earth medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: gold milk and the cacao together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's, oh, and maca.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and we drink nettle tea all the
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: We drink it all day too, during the season
that it's nettles.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll drink comfrey tea during
the season that it's comfrey.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're drinking super foods all day long,
essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we love the antioxidants.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad died of cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kelly's mom battled cancer her whole,
a long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she beat it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but we, so we've been, you know,
propelled on health through that and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, also our way of life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's again, now it's a
representation of our lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's so awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you guys kind of advocate for
people to look into, say, maybe taking
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal mushrooms on like a regular kind
of schedule thing, or do you think maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: not that broadly applicable to everyone?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that it's important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're adaptogens, which means that
they go into your body and they decide
[SPEAKER_05]: what it is that you need, you know,
there's sort of like a higher intelligent
[SPEAKER_05]: being.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mycology breaks all the rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fungi breaks all the rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, fruiting bodies, you know,
are here to help us.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they, they exudate a CO2 and
intake oxygen just like we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're just sort of an interesting
anomaly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we, we know that prolonged use of
mushrooms is what's the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're not going to really notice a
difference if you start doing mushrooms
[SPEAKER_05]: for a week, you'll definitely notice an
energy increase.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll notice a more mental increase.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, your words will come to you
quicker.
[SPEAKER_05]: You, you'll have sort of like,
you know, a better memory base
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately, but the long-term effects
are, you know, over a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we feel like years of mushroom use is
what people need to be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's, let's, let's get more specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, chaga is, you know, one of the
most powerful, if not the most powerful
[SPEAKER_02]: antioxidant of any herb on earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we know it, it has more SODs in it,
which is superoxide dismutase,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a longevity enzyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got one of the most, you know,
highest amounts of longevity enzymes in
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the Siberian shamans, you know,
I've done a tremendous amount of work in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in teaching the world about it and the
Russian and, and Korean, um, Chinese,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, have done a ton of work on
medicinal mushrooms, um, cordyceps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It builds, um, your blood and,
and builds, uh, oxygen in your blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, there's, they've been used
by Olympic athletes for years,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, to enhance their performance,
you know, in their daily routines of
[SPEAKER_02]: working out and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, there's a lot of, you know,
the Agaricon works with the lungs and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and also nootropic medicine is,
is, is part of what mushrooms are in
[SPEAKER_02]: nootropic means that it generates,
um, cell lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it helps you, it's a smart drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: Particularly in the brain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it helps generate brain cells.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and also, yeah, helps generate the,
for the cell to be able to propagate
[SPEAKER_05]: itself in a memory of a healthy cell
rather than in a memory of a non-healthy
[SPEAKER_05]: cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that's, that's the goal is that,
you know, in cancer or any kind of malaise
[SPEAKER_05]: or people that have ailments, it's that
the cell is reproducing and it will
[SPEAKER_05]: reproduce a, an ailing cell or it will
reproduce a healthy cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what is it that you're going to be able
to give your body the memory of
[SPEAKER_05]: reproducing a healthy cell?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we feel like mushrooms really help
give that much higher intelligent
[SPEAKER_05]: intelligence of the body to be able to
produce the healthier cell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause we know that nothing fights cancer
other than the immune system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, cancer can be diminished along
with everything else through chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_05]: and radiation, but the immune system is
the only thing that transforms cancer
[SPEAKER_05]: cells into healthy cells again.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something across the board.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also went into, you know,
we were talking about the intelligence of
[SPEAKER_05]: trees and a lot of these medicinal
mushrooms come from trees and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: taking all of the minerals and all of the
intelligence and they're growing directly
[SPEAKER_05]: off the tree and we can't eat the entire
tree, but we can eat the mushroom that's
[SPEAKER_05]: coming off of that tree and it has all of
the nutrients that that tree has.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like chaga comes off of the tree and
agaricon comes off the tree and the lion's
[SPEAKER_05]: mane and the turkey tail.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many are wood loving mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we live in a toxic environment in
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're just, it's just the way it
is and it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we do, we have toxins around us,
so we should be ingesting things that rid
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves of those path, you know,
of the free radicals and that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We raised our son like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a professional athlete, you know,
so, you know, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I definitely believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I wanted to touch on though,
Bodhi made a comment about how he loves to
[SPEAKER_00]: do both gardening as well as breeding
while under the influence of psychedelic
[SPEAKER_00]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something you guys have
experimented with at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you find it was productive or
maybe counterproductive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Extremely productive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the most important information
that we've gotten from the plants,
[SPEAKER_05]: some of the, one of the most life-changing
experiences that have ever happened to me
[SPEAKER_05]: and have been in my greenhouse with my
plants on psychedelics, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it cuts through stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: It leads you, it breaks the veils and it
gets you to the point of importance.
[SPEAKER_05]: It puts aside the ego and what you think
is happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it really allows you to see what is
happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like responsible use of
psychedelics is absolutely imperative.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, a lot of people say that,
you know, that kind of use could be
[SPEAKER_05]: checking out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call it checking in and checking in is
so important, especially when it comes to
[SPEAKER_05]: nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, these mushrooms have a higher
intelligence that they're there to teach
[SPEAKER_05]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've helped transform our whole entire
evolution as we know it to begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and psychedelics for some is
like, Oh, a big scary thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And psychedelics really shouldn't be,
they should be thought of as insight and
[SPEAKER_02]: spirituality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, nothing in this world is easy to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: To explain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So having insight, you know, makes a lot
of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And microdosing is something that,
you know, a lot of people are doing
[SPEAKER_02]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's a lot, it's not something that
people are really checking in on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you can create medicine
where you're just microdosing and having a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of a check-in and it can be
extremely, not only positive for
[SPEAKER_02]: gardening, it can be extremely positive on
your wellbeing and your, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some people have problems with depression
or anxiety or attention deficit disorder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it's just a neurological
connection that they need.
PTSD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we highly suggest that once again,
know your source.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mushrooms in particular, take up a lot of
toxins from the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So know your source in that area,
but yeah, it's a good check-in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dig it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you kind of answered it,
but just to get a final clarification,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had someone talking to me saying that
like they were mixing in like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I'm just going to say cube S and C's or
whatever, like just, cause you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just jumps to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a micro dose of that with say like
their regular dose of lines main thing
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they said was that it was,
they felt like it was acting as like a
[SPEAKER_00]: potentiator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe it was like, they were just maybe
feeling some of the effects of the cubes
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever it was they mixed in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, mushrooms are a
catalyst.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a catalyst for all different types
of wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a catalyst for mineral uptake in
our body.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a catalyst for so many things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Cubensis is, is one that, you know,
is sort of a master of the mushrooms in,
[SPEAKER_05]: in the way that when we take it and how we
perceive the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that wouldn't surprise me at all that
it's a catalyst for the uptake of the
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrients as well as a cognitive
understanding of it biologically,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, and when you sit with Chinese
herbs, and you mix it with other different
[SPEAKER_05]: adaptogenic herbs, then you're going to
get full spectrum uptake.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't, you know, we, we do do lipid
extraction concentrates with our CBD and
[SPEAKER_05]: we would never do that without a huge
array of mushrooms and different
[SPEAKER_05]: adaptogenic roots and herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-psychedelic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Non-psychedelic for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as the psychedelic ones go,
it makes sense to use them with other
[SPEAKER_02]: herbs for sure that support your,
your system while you're in that state.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do know that that's hard on your
liver.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to have things that are
supportive of, you know, the uptake of the
[SPEAKER_05]: toxins as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So question is a little off topic,
but I remember, I think you've even said
[SPEAKER_00]: it a few times in a few different little
talks that you kind of wanted to remain
[SPEAKER_00]: like, kind of like a mom and pop type of
company where you were still really hands
[SPEAKER_00]: on with things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that still the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you foresee that, you know,
like a point where you ever might expand
[SPEAKER_00]: your network beyond say what you could
physically deal with, or is it very core
[SPEAKER_00]: to you to, to remain kind of that hands on
approach?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome because we are expanding and
we're expanding through other farms and
[SPEAKER_05]: they're expanding through us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the knowledge is being passed on from
one farm to the next.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just becoming like, we're able to
almost be everywhere and the information
[SPEAKER_05]: is able to be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the real power.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, hands on experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just totally important to us to have
relationships with people and community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we feel like this is a way that we can
have relationship with a greater,
[SPEAKER_05]: wider international community is through
like-minded and like practicing
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivators and extractors and business
people and everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've not taken on major distributors or
major investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: In any way with our company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, no, it's not a goal for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a goal for us to sell our company
to, you know, say a global distributor
[SPEAKER_02]: type thing and, you know, get it into
every grow store worldwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do we, you know, would,
do we want a successful company?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know if it happened to where it all
went into all the growth stores and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: somehow a magical and organic,
you know, expansion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we want that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is what it is now.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like Josh had mentioned really,
you know, briefly, we don't do any
[SPEAKER_05]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like at all, we haven't spent any money
ever on marketing because we just feel
[SPEAKER_05]: like pass the information on and then the
good information will rise to the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it's more important for us
to be walking forward with integrity than
[SPEAKER_05]: walking forward with anything else and
having the voice of the plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, always in our mind and being
able to share that voice so that other
[SPEAKER_05]: people can also have it within their
integrity and their intention as they,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, grow their flowers in their
gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of a, an interesting one
because we've been talking a lot about the
[SPEAKER_00]: immune system, about the plant's immune
system, the human immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really interested in, you know,
I call them the immunomodulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of, I guess, more of like a
human term for these types of molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: but things which activate the SAR
response, systemic acquired resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: like your chitin, salicylate, salicylic
acid, jasmineic acid, these types of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on these ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you kind of play around with insect
frass or chitin or any of these kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: immunoboosters for the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you advocate for them?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, interestingly enough, one of the
highest forms of natural chitin that comes
[SPEAKER_05]: through the plant form is in a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we utilize lots of mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_05]: We utilize mushrooms as biomass.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we chop up some of the tree
mushrooms that we have here that we would
[SPEAKER_05]: use in a medicinal lipid compound,
you know, that we make here and also put
[SPEAKER_05]: it into our teas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So chitin is definitely something that we
utilize.
[SPEAKER_05]: We utilize white willow bark.
[SPEAKER_05]: We make it here on the property.
[SPEAKER_05]: We put that in our teas for the salicylic
acid.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we always look for the plants
yet again for growing on the property.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're always looking towards the
plants to give that information to us
[SPEAKER_05]: because if we're feeding plants,
we feed them and we feel like plants
[SPEAKER_05]: understand plants the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: They communicate the best with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're looking for the plant version of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we don't get the other part of
it like the powderized version.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's interesting is all the
pharmaceutical companies that have had
[SPEAKER_05]: like hexane extraction on a lot of these,
you know, say aspirin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it originally came from a plant or
all of these different compounds that we
[SPEAKER_05]: see in pharmacies and also, you know,
vitamin supplements.
[SPEAKER_05]: They originally came from plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've also, we've, we've made them
like synthetic to where our body can't
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily break it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why, you know, plants and teas
and these things are just so incredibly
[SPEAKER_05]: powerful for boosting the immune in the
immune response.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can definitely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you actually done any like toying
around yourself, so to speak with like
[SPEAKER_00]: chitin and its effects on the immune
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know it was used in traditional
Chinese medicine for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I couldn't really find any clear
evidence of whether it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cause it's not, it's not offered
as like a supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of was thinking, I don't know
how effective it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, right now it is being offered as a
supplement.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot more things coming out now
with cricket powder.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can, you can buy cricket powder and
they're taking crickets and that are
[SPEAKER_05]: problems in areas and they're turning it
into a supplement.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that that's great.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that we know for certain is
that, you know, there's been some test
[SPEAKER_05]: studies done in India and they couldn't
really figure out why is it that certain
[SPEAKER_05]: Jane regions, you know, that only eat
certain vegetables and certain types of
[SPEAKER_05]: beans and this sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is it that their B12 rates were still
pretty high in their blood counts?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, where is it that they were
getting that B12 to be able to uptake it?
[SPEAKER_05]: And after, you know, several years of
research and study, it was all of the
[SPEAKER_05]: small bugs that are in the grains and in
the lentils that they're eating every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a perfect example of,
you know, that sort of like bug and
[SPEAKER_05]: insect, we call those microbes,
you know, can be a part of our diet as
[SPEAKER_05]: well as our, as our plant's diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the holistic approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you feel free to,
you know, we can cut this one out if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to answer it because it's,
I don't know, it's maybe not in your
[SPEAKER_00]: style, but I've noticed that there's kind
of like this cyclical wave of like fad
[SPEAKER_00]: products on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the one that jumps to mind to me
is like fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, fulvic acid has always been
around, but recently we had like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Shilajit surge and you know, it kind of
came back with a force and then it's died
[SPEAKER_00]: off again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your experience with the fad
products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are there any ones where you see it
just like, so my example was the fulvic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid where it's like, you know,
it's just a basic product, but it just
[SPEAKER_00]: keeps getting recycled and rebranded and,
you know, kind of, I guess, maybe tricking
[SPEAKER_00]: some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who aren't familiar that most of
the time it's just fulvic acid in that,
[SPEAKER_00]: in that example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any kind of products which
jumped to mind, which are like this for
[SPEAKER_00]: you where, you know, like they get this
surge of popularity and it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just the same thing that's always
been there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we, I think they will probably pass
on that question because we wouldn't want
[SPEAKER_05]: to, you know, point out, you know,
a name of a product and then maybe put
[SPEAKER_05]: that down or make a fad of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that it's important that,
you know, in, in the way, yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's about the evolution.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, the community gets to decide.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're going to be lots of things
thrown at the community.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how is it that the community is going
to sift through it is more important than
[SPEAKER_05]: focusing on the company that put out some
kind of a fad product.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will be up to the community to decide
on what's going to have the longevity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so are you familiar with tricantinol
or tricontinol, however you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: pronounce it, like the natural growth
hormone?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean alfalfa?
[SPEAKER_05]: You mean alfalfa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what my question is basically there's
now like more refined versions of it
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out and it's kind of slowly getting
some traction in the market as far as I
[SPEAKER_00]: can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you looked into those more purified
versions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause obviously a lot of people maybe
knowingly or not engage in it through
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa top dresses, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what about a really kind of purified
version?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be in favor of that if it worked
similarly or is it kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: down that same school of thought we don't
engage in?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the idea of it really would be is
how is it purified?
[SPEAKER_05]: How is it concentrated?
[SPEAKER_05]: And really you get such high levels in
super healthy, really awesome alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're only going to use it once,
you know, you know, one time a cycle or
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to use it two times for a
whole cycle where you can use alfalfa in
[SPEAKER_05]: every one of your feedings.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just going to be prolonged over
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really goes back to, you know,
sometimes we overthink ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes the basic raw whole food is
really what's best for us more often
[SPEAKER_05]: rather than less often and a bunch of,
you know, pre-packaged stuff in between.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people are going to want
gibberellic acid because it makes their
[SPEAKER_02]: plants grow, you know, super tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you might just find out
that you can just use your urine with
[SPEAKER_02]: water and you'd be like, Oh my God,
this works a hundred times.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred times better than anything I've
gotten from the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, seriously, it feels like we could
go right back to the basics on almost
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really works better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, we're not really down with all the
new and improved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not saying that there's not a place for
evolution and not saying that there's not
[SPEAKER_02]: a place for all things and all good times.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, um, we constantly look towards
nature to be our mentor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe what we'll find is a new biomass
bush to grow, you know, maybe we'll find a
[SPEAKER_02]: new, you know, tree that, that blooms all
summer for the bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, now I'm talking, now we're talking
about a product, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A grass that propagates mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like now, now let's talk, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a bit of a weird one,
but a lot of people commonly will say that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't do kind of like a no-till type
of philosophy unless you're in a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: size pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the commonly referenced number is
about 30 liters or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, do you drive with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you think people using small pots
can successfully under do kind of nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling and the concepts of what no-till
is advocating?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think there is that requirement
for a certain size pot?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to limit people, you know,
but, you know, it's going to work better
[SPEAKER_02]: in a bigger pot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a plant's going to grow better,
a plant's going to grow better in a bigger
[SPEAKER_05]: pot and a plant's going to grow better in
a bigger bed, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's easier to keep your biology
happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's options, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: But some people only have small pots and
if that's, and if this is the introduction
[SPEAKER_05]: that they're getting for them to be able
to grow really awesome medicine to share
[SPEAKER_05]: with your friends or, you know,
if they're needing it, then that's
[SPEAKER_05]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like Josh said, we just really don't
want to limit, you just do your very best.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so much conversation out there
right now on what the word regenerative
[SPEAKER_05]: is, you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: For us, it's like if you're creating more
balances than checks, you're doing good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all can't just automatically have
some closed loop regenerative farm where
[SPEAKER_05]: everything is just running perfectly,
you know?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of us have to start in a closet with
a couple of, you know, one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do your best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do your best there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have to have really small plants for
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you were going to do,
you know, a small pot, you'd have to have
[SPEAKER_02]: really small plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise the roots would colonize the
root zone too much and it would just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would choke out the life that you're
trying to do in a prolonged environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the smaller pot you have,
the more, you know, thought out intention
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have to put into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a little bit of room,
you know, within a bed, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a safety net in a way,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's a huge safety net.
[SPEAKER_05]: We always say that, you know, a soilless
medium is like the plant uptaking through
[SPEAKER_05]: an IV.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then a plant, a soil that just has a
little teeny tiny bit in it is somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: who, you know, a person that may have,
you know, not a very good digestive tract.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you have big heaping soil piles
and you've been working on it for a really
[SPEAKER_05]: long time, it's the same as that person
that you would call that has an iron gut
[SPEAKER_05]: that they can take.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything and you can throw anything at
that person and they're not allergic to
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got nothing because they have such
a tremendous amount of microbiology.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the more you build your
microbiology, the more you're going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to throw at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The least amount of microbiology to be
very careful what you throw at it because
[SPEAKER_05]: your plant can't understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can definitely see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a lot of your products they use for
teas and for top dressings.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I have seen the odd person just
using it as a straight soil amendment,
[SPEAKER_00]: just mixing it in, or like kind of like a
revitalization thing after a cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find you get pretty much the same
results doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you kind of, you know, if possible,
advocate for them to be used as teas or
[SPEAKER_00]: like the way maybe you marketed it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just valuable, you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an absolutely amazing soil additive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just phenomenal what the roots do
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even just in the transplant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really not just, you know,
our products, it's the idea of just
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing in green material into your
soils, you know, making sure that you've
[SPEAKER_05]: got some herbal compounds and some plant
material in there more than just kelp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like take all your sun leaves from your
previous harvest and put them in your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that just really helps increase the
bacteria, you know, breakdown.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the bacteria then starts to feed
the fungi.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, when you up it all,
it's best.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in nature, you know, when you go to
the most beautiful pristine forest,
[SPEAKER_05]: it has varying amounts of decomposition
from the leaves all around it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that's really easy to
mimic in your garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's easy to mimic even in your first
soil mixes.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could mimic that by adding more leaf
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's actually something people
are a little scared of, at least mixing it
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm a bit, I don't mind top
dressing, but yeah, I think there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of, yeah, I don't know what the
word is better than yeah, like really
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We utilize all of it, our hash leftovers,
you know, all of the green material from
[SPEAKER_05]: our hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: We make sure to make it at a time that
we're mixing our soil for our nurseries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we make sure that that's all
like cyclical and all that green fresh
[SPEAKER_05]: material just goes right in and it's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even carrot pulp.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be making carrot juice and we'll put
carrot pulp in there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can be really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just the idea that you can utilize so much
different vegetation to help spark your
[SPEAKER_05]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of indirectly touched on this
question, but I just wanted to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: final ruling on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of IPM or sorry, IPFM methods do
you guys use throughout kind of the more
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering phases?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had an infestation, let's just say
a mite, you know, a lot of people kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the types of things you'd be
looking to use or to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of philosophies to utilize?
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're in flowering cycle, which is
always the most difficult, definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: bring in your rooms up to 120 degrees
Fahrenheit, 50 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kills all thin exoskeleton mites as well
as aphids.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll literally explode.
[SPEAKER_05]: So utilizing heat treatment is fantastic,
but making sure that your root zone is
[SPEAKER_05]: damp and well fed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because your roots need to stay very moist
and they need to stay cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not heating up your indoor rooms
through lights.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't have your lights on high and
heat it up that much because the pores of
[SPEAKER_05]: the leaves are gonna open.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the pores of the leaves are open,
they're very susceptible to light UV
[SPEAKER_05]: light.
[SPEAKER_05]: In greenhouses, you can get it up to 120,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can watch the buds actually swell.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll get more yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really noticing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The resin is really coming out and you're
being able to kill off really the thin
[SPEAKER_05]: exoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be killing off your predators as
well, but you put your predators on
[SPEAKER_05]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_05]: It certainly doesn't kill things like
wasps, you know, and plants love 50
[SPEAKER_05]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, people say, oh, is that so hot?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you look at where the plants
actually come from and the season that
[SPEAKER_05]: they grow in.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just love heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not something that is gonna bother
you, but it's something that you should
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely stay in your room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a glass of water for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're sort of like taking a sauna
either in your greenhouse or in your room
[SPEAKER_05]: or wherever you are to try to reach that
50 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use Swirsky and Cucumeras together
for broad mites and russet mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, a persimilus or
californicus or andersoni for the spider
[SPEAKER_02]: mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to have a good predator colony on your
plants allows you to not have to use the
[SPEAKER_02]: sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually use like two to three times
the amount that they suggest to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: But not two to three times as often.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just two to three times the amount.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you do the heat treatment.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're infested in later flower,
you do the heat treatment and then you
[SPEAKER_05]: just bombard your room with predators.
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully, you know, you've got enough
time that the predators will eat all of
[SPEAKER_05]: the rest that's there and then they just
leave.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not interested in staying on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't colonize on the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't breed on cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just going in and they're eating.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of people worry about,
oh geez, am I smoking predators?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, they're eating and then they're
leaving.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just really helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we love the use of predators.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in vegetative times, if there's an
outbreak, we love botanical washes and not
[SPEAKER_05]: utilizing, you know, essential oils or
volatile oils in heavy amounts.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't really like my skin
covered in heavy oil.
[SPEAKER_05]: Neither do the leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you want to, you know, wash them,
you can take fresh neem leaf and fresh
[SPEAKER_05]: rosemary or fresh, you know, eucalyptus or
fresh lavender and make a nice tea brew
[SPEAKER_05]: and steep it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It with horsetail or with another herb
that you want and make it a botanical wash
[SPEAKER_05]: that isn't good for pathogens.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's healthy for beneficials and it's also
healthy for the flowers and literally like
[SPEAKER_05]: washing the plants down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's they just love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a really good preventative as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also to help get rid of an
infestation.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to follow that up then with
predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sounds like a pretty good little IPM
regime there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last question before we hit the little
short fire ones at the end, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to forgive me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to mispronounce the name,
but I have a feeling you guys will know
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of our viewers wanted to know,
what are your thoughts on the sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: Wallopini greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how you say it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wallopini?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wallopini.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we have on our property.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say sealed, you know,
you know, we like to have a flow through
[SPEAKER_05]: design because the humidity stays nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's stable.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the temperatures are more
stable.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plants love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything just grows.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a huge biological sink.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have them now all over.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been working with Wallopinis for
a long time and inspire other people to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have lots of designs that we've
just freed up and given out to people.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been working on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anytime we do consultations, we always
talk to people about, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: Wallopinis and bringing that in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you're utilizing all beneficial
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're utilizing the geothermal from the
earth and then you're utilizing the heat,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, from the sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's just awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great way to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're on to the last little quick fire
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one, we'll probably get two
answers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm going to have to say the home
stutter because that's what we're doing
[SPEAKER_05]: right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's been really amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been only wanting to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to go with the homesteader.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's got its roots in, let's see,
a Jack.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really love that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is like a purple tie times the God,
but times a really awesome Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sally's gift will say I'll say Sally's
gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll say homesteader.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're so uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That Jack Harrow that was used in the
Zellies, is that that famous one that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: around or just a different one?
[SPEAKER_02]: It absolutely is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a well-known clone that came from
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it came from Eugene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really special.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the best ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was really special.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's in a lot of our genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was a really wonderful mother that
we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Harrow and Super Lemonade are a big
part of our genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we like that lemon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's great because those are like
two cuts or two strains, I should say,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically where if you get that cut
that's on the money, it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: unbeatable, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or when you find that one seed,
too, that you're just like, whoa,
[SPEAKER_04]: this plant is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just want to be able to propagate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, finished outdoors for us really
nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a slightly derivative question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of favorite strain, what's your
favorite land race?
[SPEAKER_05]: Acapulco Gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go with Acapulco Gold,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which has fruits in the Jack Harrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although the chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go with chocolate tie since she went
with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I could go with chocolate tie
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should just both switch to chocolate
tie now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, I was going to say, did you guys
see any of the pearl tie that Bodhi had?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I hadn't seen it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we had brought down some of his tie
strains to Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, he would have seen them there anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Pakistani Chitral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's another good one,
which probably would have done well in
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica as well, wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they flower a little later,
don't they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we brought that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that's going down there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see how they go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brought down so many different types of
varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see what what comes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're excited to see what happens out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So excluding your own work, who's the
breeders work who you're most excited to
[SPEAKER_00]: pop next?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's so hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to list the top 10.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we really like the people that
we've already mentioned, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Mr. Bob Hemphill, you know,
but the two of them, Graham and Darcy are
[SPEAKER_02]: both, you know, they're amazing people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a connection with the plant,
you know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's always like such a higher level of
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And absolutely, Tommy, big ups.
[SPEAKER_05]: The connection that he has with the plant
is so kind and true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green source garden source gardens,
amazing seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse from Bio Vortex makes making really,
really beautiful, intentional seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush Kirk, our friend, our family down in
the southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're not they're not selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not selling seeds actively,
but it's the people that have the really
[SPEAKER_02]: intelligent garden beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the pure farm, not grass family
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a top one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's going to be something to look for.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone should look for intention there,
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many breeders out there that
are just now stepping in.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we've been trading seeds for
three decades now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've all been working together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we weren't working directly with
the person and indirectly, we were working
[SPEAKER_05]: with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's like all of everybody's work
that they're able to put forward and
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mean amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we keep talking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep going.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already said split.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has some really amazing streams.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I know that, yeah,
evolved, evolved Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's been some amazing lion tree,
lion tree farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really doing awesome stuff with
THCB lion paw.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's also working with like CBG.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are starting to specialize in
different like cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you want to make sure to get
those so then you can interbreed because
[SPEAKER_05]: they've got like really super high CBG or
THCV.
[SPEAKER_05]: House of Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_05]: House of Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wade Laughter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Big ups to Wade Laughter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Wade, for bringing forth all
the Harlequin.
[SPEAKER_05]: What an amazing, humble, beautiful person.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, he is of the earth.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if anybody gets to grow some of
his strains, we're only lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what a testament.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on to the next little question,
though, kind of similar to the first one,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you get a few choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Desert Island strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll let you take two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find two is a good number because
everyone wants three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes it that little bit harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only take two strains with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, two strains with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you got forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would probably take the healer as a
strain that we've created.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I would go with the healer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, you know, the half CBD half.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they're beautiful one to one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would do that because it's really good
if you don't feel good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that one to one is super awesome if
you're having a hard day on the island,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, if you're feeling like,
wow, this day is hard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got sunburn.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go for the one to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take like a golden pineapple.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I think I would go with the goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I would go with an Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I'm going to go with a healer and
an Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one to one, which is an AC DC cross
with like a really awesome 840 ask you
[SPEAKER_05]: type super high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take the homesteader because
that's the reason why we created it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to take the homesteader in
the healer because after I'm done
[SPEAKER_02]: homesteading, I need to do some healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Telling a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next one is, as long as there's
lots of it, there has to be lots of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, infinite, infinite.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quantity probably was the first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flavor of the month, so to speak,
tends to be very much a cyclical thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your prediction for the next big
flavor of the month?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it might be the hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the flavor of the month is going
to be a super high.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cherries are coming on strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that not just cherry wine,
like there's a lot of cherry sherbards and
[SPEAKER_02]: puffs and cherry diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sour diesel and the chem dog and and
the OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's so gnarly and so good
still.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like you can like have all the
new varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, the cookies have taken over,
you know, in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a certain spice that you get
from that that people like a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I think that people are
going to go for the more lemony uplifting
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff personally coming up here in the
future.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we're seeing an uprise in the
grapefruits, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the grapefruit strains are
going to start going through the roof.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also think they're going to see a
huge surge and really low THC and super
[SPEAKER_05]: high CBD, full spectrum cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will be in like the hemp work
that has been done in Colorado and beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those predictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: One other thing is there's there's
definitely going to be like new
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids that we learn about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be a lot about learning
those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the strains, there's going to
be a lot of specific strains for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one I kind of thought about myself,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lucky last one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could go back to one place in time
anywhere, where would you go and what
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds would you collect?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I would have gone back to 1982 in
South Africa and I would have gotten the
[SPEAKER_05]: Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_05]: Darn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I missed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried a good Durban that like,
you know, and it's won you over type of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we've we've got somebody in South
Africa that has sent us seeds that he's
[SPEAKER_05]: saying is definitely the best.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I've yet to see the Durban that I
smoked in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_05]: That to me, what I had seen was a
beautiful Durban poison.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have not seen that since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I think I would definitely like
to go back like pre-industrial revolution,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably mid, you know, anything before,
you know, eighteen hundreds, maybe let's
[SPEAKER_02]: say a thousand years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd like to go into the pygmies,
pygmy tribes and smoke pygmy weed and
[SPEAKER_02]: build like pygmy bridges and and villages.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'd want to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And their rhythms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd want to play drums and sing with
pygmies and grow weed in the jungle in the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle of Africa.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good answer, Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say that's the best answer I've ever
heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that one's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that one might bring us to
the end of all the knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: information we've been able to get from
you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any comments or shout outs you
wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, shout out to all the people that
are working really hard to bring this
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine forward to the masses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to you for putting this type of
intention into the community and
[SPEAKER_02]: education.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shout out to all the pure farmers out
there and all those people that are still
[SPEAKER_05]: working within within integrity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and the biggest shout out thanks to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: The biggest shout out to the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for bringing us together and
helping us.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, I know that she's made
my life so much better and all of the
[SPEAKER_05]: people that we have, you know,
been a part of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to give a shout out to the earth
for for giving us a place to do all this
[SPEAKER_02]: magic on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stars and the sun for giving us a
cosmic connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks so much again, Josh and Kelly
for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, take care.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: What a great fun this was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have it, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A huge thank you again to Josh and Kelly
for taking the time to talk to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: A huge thank you to you guys for listening
through the end and a huge thank you to
[SPEAKER_00]: our Patreon gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are the MVP's.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, thank you to Organic Gardening
Solutions, 420 Australia and SEEDS here
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best sponsors in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you guys next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you.
[SPEAKER_04]: La, la, la, la, la.
[SPEAKER_04]: La, la, la.
