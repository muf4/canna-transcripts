[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome back for part two of our epic
episode with Doobie of AC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you enjoyed the first episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was full of knowledge, and if you
haven't heard it, go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we've got a whole nother half for
you to get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you enjoyed part two as much as we
enjoyed part one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without further delay, let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great answer because my next
question was gonna be exactly about that,
[SPEAKER_01]: the killer A5 haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been reading about this because it
looks like it could be the holy grail for
[SPEAKER_01]: sativa heads like myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you recommend this cross for people
who like the really sort of racy,
[SPEAKER_01]: uplifting high?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are looking for extremely powerful
and intense haze hybrid that combines the
[SPEAKER_04]: Neville's world with us, with extreme
potency, it's killer A5, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's killer A5.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how would you describe that one for
people in terms of the smells and the type
[SPEAKER_01]: of high and the flower time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the original A5 clone is a long
flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can go over 100 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we harvest in my city, in the coast,
last week of August.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sorry, last week of November,
early December.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although they are half northern light,
they are very haze dominant and very long
[SPEAKER_04]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: The A5 haze is the only plant I have found
that can compete with the extreme potency
[SPEAKER_04]: of the Malawi.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was when I experienced also the A5
haze the first time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I say one, this has the type of incense
and the low incense I'm looking from the
[SPEAKER_04]: Neville's clones because the others don't
have.
[SPEAKER_04]: The C5 is not so intense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember it?
[SPEAKER_04]: That is not so intense.
[SPEAKER_04]: The taste is quite lemony type.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say, wow, the A5 is the one for
incense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's also the one for the most extreme
potency from the Neville world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I want to keep this extreme potency,
from A5, and I want to even make it
[SPEAKER_04]: stronger, the only way is Malawi.
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought the A5 to the lab and it tested
25%, but it hits like 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought the new Malawi killer to the
same lab and it was 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by crossing A5 with my killer Malawi
parental plants, I can increase even more
[SPEAKER_04]: the tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: The type of effects are similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Super trippy, but with narcosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very profound.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm super long-lasting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very heavy in the head and in the body.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both have this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was very natural for me to blend
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Malawi contributes, increasing
even more the the THC, making it more
[SPEAKER_04]: reasonous.
[SPEAKER_04]: My killer Malawis are on the 80 plus
flowering range.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the flowering time of the A5 is
shortened down also.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the A5 contributes with the signature
loading fence hayseed terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's killer A5.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's extremely potent, intense,
very high yielding, and a bit easier to
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivate than A5.
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably a bit stronger if you do
proper selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great information there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's going to be the one that
I'm probably going to jump on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The photos of it look great as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last answer, you mentioned the hash
plant haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is an interesting one because I
don't know if many people have heard about
[SPEAKER_01]: it, maybe unlike the C5 or the A5,
which they might have heard about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember I got to smell it and I tried a
little bit of it, but I think it was
[SPEAKER_01]: seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it smelled a bit like the C5 to me in
the similar terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was interesting about it was it felt
like a real hybrid, like it was kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the hash plant brought some
indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: The C5 was sort of sativary.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think it's going to breed well
with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you want to pair it with a sativa,
with an indica?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you describe the hash plant
haze to people who haven't tried it?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you know both.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you say, both the hash plant haze seed
from Nebula and the C5 haze, which is
[SPEAKER_04]: Northern Life 5 haze seed, are very
similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have the same dad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the finished product is also very
similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Northern Life 5, the C5, sorry,
has the lemony terps a bit more alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hash plant haze is a bit, you can
detect the same tie-like terps from the
[SPEAKER_04]: haze seed dad, but it's more dark,
more dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes more like, the hash plant I
think is more like Moroccan palm taste,
[SPEAKER_04]: the yellow Moroccan hash taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more earthy, hashy, Moroccan kind of
terpenes, the hash plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they are quite similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you say, the CML adds these
tie-like terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We brought to the lab for terpenes
analysis both.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we saw that they were very similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for cannabinoid, they are also very
similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both are very similar.
[SPEAKER_04]: In chemotapes and in terpenes profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: The effect of the hash plant is slightly
more funny, both very similar,
[SPEAKER_04]: while the C5 smoke is more tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely, definitely feel like I
picked up on some of those things you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our listeners was wondering if you
had any tips to help them grow long
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering sativas indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things they wanted to know
is if they had maybe an ace strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: that said it was going to go, you know,
say 16 or more weeks, would you recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: putting it in 12, 12 from seed or does
that have negative effects on the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends because it depends a lot on
flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think anything or 10 weeks or more,
people consider it long flowering,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the same like trying to grow
indoors a tider or thimer haze that
[SPEAKER_04]: flowers four to six months indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sativa dominant hybrid that has
already refined, that takes three months
[SPEAKER_04]: of flowering indoors and performs well
indoors like golden tiger.
[SPEAKER_04]: It requires different approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but considering that you are growing
a long flowering sativa, okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the problem is just the long flowering
and the size.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all this indoors, the typical failure
that growers do with sativa is to provide
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of pot size and a lot of growing
time.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: The tropical, the sativas and the tropical
sativas take longer to reach sexual
[SPEAKER_04]: maturity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually seven, eight, nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: This means that the plant will grow,
will grow, will grow from seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And until reaching the sexual maturity
before the plant is not able to flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter the photoperiod you're using,
it's not going to flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to keep the, if the grower
wants to keep the plants small and under
[SPEAKER_04]: control during these two months that the
plant is reaching sexual maturity,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's better to use a small pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, three liter pot just to let
it grow until the plant shows sex,
[SPEAKER_04]: for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: You say, in that way you can keep many
plants in a small pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if you only want to grow females,
you say, okay, I discard the females.
[SPEAKER_04]: I discard the males, sorry, but this
didn't take much space, only three liter
[SPEAKER_04]: potage.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you have the females in a small pots
and then you switch to flower,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you keep them in the small pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the sativas and especially
tropical sativas, the early flowering and
[SPEAKER_04]: stretching is very strong, very,
very strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can double, triple or even more
multiply their size just in early
[SPEAKER_04]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the best way to control their size
without topping is with rod bound.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're using a small pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, if you let the female in the
three liter pot after sexing and you
[SPEAKER_04]: switch to flower, the sativa-dominant
hybrid or the tropical sativa will start
[SPEAKER_04]: to flower, will do the early flowering and
stretching, but in a more moderate way.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: The grower will be able to tame as much as
possible the size of the tropical sativa
[SPEAKER_04]: from seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some sativa-dominant hybrids will
work well under 12-12, like could be
[SPEAKER_04]: Panama, Bangui Hayes, Malawi, Malawi Cross
Panama, Golden Tiger.
[SPEAKER_04]: This work well under classic 12-12.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other strains like pure Thai, old-timer
hares, you need to go down 11-13,
[SPEAKER_04]: 10-14 even.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously another trick is to start
from clones, from sexually mature clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once it's established in the new,
in the pot, you directly switch to flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: In that way, you can have sativa,
so one meter, less than one meter,
[SPEAKER_04]: a bit more, but very, very under control.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great advice there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering, have you ever
experimented with different day and night
[SPEAKER_01]: times?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, DJ Short famously said
that he gives 11 hours of light,
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 hours of dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he thinks that it makes the plants
express more sativa-like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you found anything like that on your
own?
[SPEAKER_04]: Every strain is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a reason that his approach was
like to start the germination of the
[SPEAKER_04]: tropical sativa under 14-10, no?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is, for example, in the
subtropical strain, we have been talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about in Canary Islands, in Hawaii,
in New Caledonia, in Reunion Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's that photo period.
[SPEAKER_04]: The longer days will be 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you grow the plants, and when you
decide, you switch to 11-13.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very tropical strains from zero to seven
from the equator.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, Thais, extreme Colombians,
extreme Jamaicans, extreme Central
[SPEAKER_04]: Africans.
[SPEAKER_04]: These plants don't flower under 12-12.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are in an everlasting, early
flowering and stretching.
[SPEAKER_04]: So indoors, they just grow longer nodes
and longer nodes, and they put a few
[SPEAKER_04]: pistils, but they continue because they
are feeling that they are in that moment,
[SPEAKER_04]: that they need to stretch and make a space
for the buds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they will only, this extreme tropical
will only go deep to the flowering process
[SPEAKER_04]: when they are 11-13.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even to make them fully ripe and avoid
more reflowerings and reflowerings,
[SPEAKER_04]: you even need to bring down the photo
period at the end, maybe to 10-14 photo
[SPEAKER_04]: period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen online that I think you had
mentioned somewhere that you felt like a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of indoor growers only really want to
do eight or nine weeks strains because
[SPEAKER_01]: they think that they're going to yield
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you said, oh, you know,
but if you grow a strain that takes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, three or four weeks longer,
it will yield more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is worth the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like not enough growers are
sort of aware of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it feels like there's not a lot of
sort of commercial people trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: sativas, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we help get the message out there
that sativas are viable?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think many people realize,
especially the young ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also the false meat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without indica, there's no yielding
hybrids, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have many, many people that ask me the
same question over the years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a seven, eight week flowering plant
that yields well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I say, oh, early flowering plants are
not the best yielders.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are good indica strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want an indica?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are good indica strains that are
good yielding with nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want even better yields,
better to grow a 50-50 hybrid,
[SPEAKER_04]: a real F1 hybrid 50-50 that has a lot of
heterosis, hybrid bigger.
[SPEAKER_04]: And wait until, for example, the Malawi
Cross PCK.
[SPEAKER_04]: It flowers nine, 10, 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the yield is the double that a plant
of eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it worth to wait two, three weeks
more and yield the double and harvest the
[SPEAKER_04]: double and harvest something that has more
sativa and probably can provide different
[SPEAKER_04]: effects?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ask me for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we talk about the whole picture,
what are the biggest cannabis yielding in
[SPEAKER_04]: the world?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is sativa dominant hybrids with just a
touch of indica?
[SPEAKER_04]: 70, 80% hybrids that can grow five to six
meters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big and yield two, three, five kilos.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have just enough indica genetics
to add the bad density to make waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the long cordless flower structure,
the big size, the super vigor,
[SPEAKER_04]: all these strains that at the end will
come on the final yield come from the
[SPEAKER_04]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: The good flower leaf ratios that is a good
trade for later, for bagapin and for
[SPEAKER_04]: trimming is the indica.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indicas have very bad flower leaf,
bad ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sativa have better.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the end, if you want a very high
yielding with very great flower leaf
[SPEAKER_04]: ratio, you must go to sativa genetics,
no indica.
[SPEAKER_04]: And wait a bit more, but it will be worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the sounds of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's the case worldwide,
but I feel like in Australia and in
[SPEAKER_01]: America at least, people prefer indicas
over sativas generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was trying to think about why that
was like, why do people seem to like
[SPEAKER_01]: indicas more?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of was thinking, Oh,
well, maybe it's got something to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: how sometimes people who sort of have
anxiety or are naturally a bit nervous
[SPEAKER_01]: will use cannabis to help with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, those people aren't going to
like sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I kind of thought, Oh,
I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's just individual biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering, do you feel like more
people like indicas than sativas?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how can we try to convert some of the
people who like indicas over to the dark
[SPEAKER_01]: side to try the sativas?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I, if you like indicas and if you
like smoke indicas, I don't think it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: dark side or it's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I think is a bad thing is the
reductionism to simplify the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: qualities of the cannabis gen pool towards
only the indica dominant strains that look
[SPEAKER_04]: good on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think the cannabis is much
more than this, has much more to offer
[SPEAKER_04]: than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that a lot of people don't
tolerate well.
[SPEAKER_04]: The sativa effects and prefer the indica
or CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's perfect for smoking sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one is better person.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not, it's not better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I think it has to do with both
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: In one side, the industry, both in America
in the eighties and in Holland,
[SPEAKER_04]: developed commercially within the growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the best strains that were developed
within the growing had a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because Northern California,
[SPEAKER_04]: they need in Northern California,
the October is already cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Holland, they don't have a good
weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, commercially it went to fast
flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indoor plants of Afghani indica genetic
background.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Afghani also, they were the most
suitable strains to adapt genetics to
[SPEAKER_04]: indoor growing, to shorten flowering
times, to make the buds denser,
[SPEAKER_04]: to increase resistance in production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at the end, the standard for commercial
quality weed after the skunk is,
[SPEAKER_04]: and now with the cool, and the cookies is
obviously, and it's a fact, is the indica
[SPEAKER_04]: dominant strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of them have a bit of sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are very complex polyhybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see that they produce sometimes
thinner leaves, but the flower is all
[SPEAKER_04]: about the refinement of the cannabis
Afghani indica.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are succeeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are the best on it in our industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: In North America, North America are the
pioneers of the modern Western marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to thank to the hippies that we
are smoking and have this cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_04]: today.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are the biggest country with the
biggest cannabis culture in the Western
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are pioneers in breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I cannot complain much about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But honestly, their style doesn't match
with my style of what I like, but it's
[SPEAKER_04]: just my taste and I don't think is better
than the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you ask me, I would like to see more
genetic diversity and more sativa strains
[SPEAKER_04]: being grown and being appreciated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a bit like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's of the industry and also what you say
a bit of the society we live now on,
[SPEAKER_04]: when the hippies started with all this,
they wanted to make the revolution and use
[SPEAKER_04]: the revolution, use the drugs for the
revolution.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we live in the days of globally side
capitalism.
[SPEAKER_04]: We deal with a lot of stress.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are very disconnected with the natural
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: We suffer a lot of depression and anxiety
increase in this modern world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's normal that people need approach
to cannabis from the medical way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they prefer something that is
more like a stone that will kill the day
[SPEAKER_04]: because they have had a note that they
just want something that will kill the day
[SPEAKER_04]: and will help them to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if they have a medical problem,
don't get high and get some medical relief
[SPEAKER_04]: from the CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you could tell us a
little bit about the Spanish scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I was interested in knowing
specifically was, is hash still a big
[SPEAKER_01]: thing over there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as a follow up, are there any
sort of differences in the culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: just even regionally from say different
areas in different parts of Spain?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being close to Morocco, the Spanish
cannabis culture was all about hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when this first century grows,
the growth shocks and the genetics start
[SPEAKER_04]: to come from, the people start to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a very thriving cannabis industry
started to consolidate here.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the seed banks, from grow source that
are the small retailer, to big wholesaler,
[SPEAKER_04]: to fertilizer companies, to magazines,
to making events, lawyers, everything,
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It started 20 years ago or a bit more,
but it met when that seed bank was going
[SPEAKER_04]: down and we were just creating our
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, of course, a few strong seed
banks in Holland still remain strong,
[SPEAKER_04]: like greenhouse, like that spaceship.
[SPEAKER_04]: And two new ones very strong appear,
like Royal Queen and Barnis, for example.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here in Spain, we were competing,
the Spanish people managed to create
[SPEAKER_04]: companies that were competing in products
and in volume of business with a Dutch
[SPEAKER_04]: company.
[SPEAKER_04]: At all levels, at all levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: In a few years, now, after 20 years,
the sector moves a lot of millions,
[SPEAKER_04]: creates a lot of employment.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are legal companies like Manda,
we pay a lot of taxes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here in Spain, the weather is extremely
good and we are one of the strongest
[SPEAKER_04]: countries in the world for tourism.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are a population of less than 50 and we
have 70, 80 million of tourists per year
[SPEAKER_04]: before COVID, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people from England, Germany,
Sweden, when they retire, they buy a house
[SPEAKER_04]: here in Spain to live because the weather,
the quality of life is cheaper than lawful
[SPEAKER_04]: culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of different culture from
the south, the Mediterranean, the north,
[SPEAKER_04]: the central, the food is completely
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are very tolerant.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of culture history.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like a lot of the party.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is the perfect place so that
tourists could come and create a
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all come here to get drunk,
to enjoy the beach, to all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's happening now with the social clubs,
especially in Barcelona, that is always
[SPEAKER_04]: the most tolerant city and that is go
ahead of the rest of Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the model is not still fully legal,
not for the seed banks, not for the
[SPEAKER_04]: producer of the clubs, not for the clubs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very incomplete model that allows
to distribute seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our company can buy and sell seeds
legally.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make products oriented for the
cannabis growing, like the fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_04]: the lamps, the soil, brands and all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But still Spain is very, very behind of
the worldwide legalization that is
[SPEAKER_04]: happening in North America, in Latin
America now, Uruguay, Colombia,
[SPEAKER_04]: Mexico just now, Ecuador also legalizing,
[SPEAKER_04]: in Thailand just legalizing, many African
countries are legalizing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Morocco just said two weeks ago they're
considering the legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here in Europe, Germany has included the
marijuana in the national health system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are buying legal marijuana from
BLPs from Canada, from Israel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, it's happening, it's happening,
but some countries, Europe is being slow
[SPEAKER_04]: compared with United States, with Latin
America.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Australia and Europe, we are very
stupid.
[SPEAKER_04]: In our cases, Jordi, it's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, yeah, I mean Australia
has got a cannabis program, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: probably not very good to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I was wondering why, because we're
kind of talking about hash, you got me
[SPEAKER_01]: interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which of your strains do you think makes
the best hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as a kind of slightly different
question, which strain has the largest
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome heads?
[SPEAKER_04]: For extraction, the best one that we have
in the case would be a Bubahash,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is Bubacus hash plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not a very land-risk hybrid,
but I like it so much, and the customer
[SPEAKER_04]: like it so much that we offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the Bubacus cross PCG is also very
nice for hash and extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hash plant, and then the Calichina
doesn't give so much return, but it gives
[SPEAKER_04]: a hash that is very, very special,
like very exotic in some say hash,
[SPEAKER_04]: the Calichina, quite different to the
Afghani hashes that are more common with
[SPEAKER_04]: the cookies, the OGs and the Bubah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then for Pakistani kind of hash and
extraction, the Pakistan Chitralcus and
[SPEAKER_04]: Violeta, because it's very nice that the
trichomes really carry the pigments.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you do the extraction and the
hash, the hash most of the time becomes
[SPEAKER_04]: purple or violet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, this with Pakistan Chitralcus,
the purple fennel, or with Violeta.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is quite interesting for Pakistani
hash and colorful hashes.
[SPEAKER_04]: For more Afghani, the Bubahash,
they already recommend you.
[SPEAKER_04]: For CBD extraction, CBD1 for sure is
extremely resinous and very good terpenes
[SPEAKER_04]: for extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to make CBD extraction,
CBD1 is excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have Sativas that are very,
very, very resinous, but usually the
[SPEAKER_04]: Sativas produce, the Indicas produce the
resin more divided also in the bracts,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nearby the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sativa concentrate much of the resin
on the bracts and not so much on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for extraction, they are not so good in
return.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have Sativa, Domina and Highbreeze
that are very resinous.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, Panama Fern works very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Panama Cross Bangi Hayes also,
Malawi Cross Panama.
[SPEAKER_04]: Killer A5, Thamaldelica Fern.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these are Sativas that are Golden
Tiger Fern that are very good for
[SPEAKER_04]: extraction with Sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some great answers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was browsing through your catalog of
strains on one of the seed banks and I
[SPEAKER_01]: noticed there was one that I'd never seen
before called Hokkaido and it says that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like a Japanese hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds very rare and unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you tell us a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was another genetic swap with a
grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: A person from Japan contacted me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did some research when trying to
get a picture of how the two land races
[SPEAKER_04]: were divided around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, I read something about Japanese
strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was not clear the information
whether they were really psychoactive
[SPEAKER_04]: Japanese cannabis strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like breathe for the psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure, it was used for fiber.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ceremonial uses for thousands of years at
least is documented in their own rituals.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also in the fabric, for the clothes,
they have a long tradition of cultivating
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have gathered, there was many,
many hemp strains all around Japan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Japan, you know, the climates are
quite different.
[SPEAKER_04]: The south, there are some islands that are
almost subtropical and Hokkaido,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is the north part, is an island on
the north, is very cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: The summers is a very natural reserve,
very beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it has short summer, but the cold
weather comes very fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: The autumn is very short and the winter is
very long.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it was difficult because it was
not properly documented.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after the Second World War,
Japan had to comply and follow the laws
[SPEAKER_04]: from the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at that time, already the United
States had the laws regarding the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: and marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think they tried, many of the old
Japanese hemp strains probably have been
[SPEAKER_04]: eradicated during these years,
the previous decades of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: And somewhat in Hokkaido, which is a
wilder place,
[SPEAKER_04]: the hemp has escaped from the eradication
programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So although they tried because they
eradicate millions of plants yearly.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, population of cannabis managed to
thrive without human help there in
[SPEAKER_04]: Hokkaido.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I contacted with one Japanese and he,
I told him, and what about Hokkaido?
[SPEAKER_04]: He told me, yeah, yeah, I have some seeds
I can send you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we did an exchange and did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was quite excited about to see what
could come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we grow, the first week was quite
exciting because it grew like a
[SPEAKER_04]: Hasplanindica, like wild leaves,
looks like quite like a Vanica.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like the indoor plants,
you see, no?
[SPEAKER_04]: It remind me a lot like the Chinese
Indica, the China Yunnan in some ways
[SPEAKER_04]: remind me a lot too, but still those
Indica Hasplan traits.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, so I have hopes that it could be
a secretive Indica strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not the first population,
the P1 plants we grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, we didn't grow it to the
best potential because the first cycle,
[SPEAKER_04]: we got a spider mite infection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we had to take clones, then we flower
them again outside, but it was extremely
[SPEAKER_04]: hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was in summertime here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they didn't like much the weather.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the samples didn't express,
we brought them to the lab and they were
[SPEAKER_04]: very similar with like a Hempest strain,
like 0.5 of THC and 0.5 of CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least it's good that the CBD was,
since that was active, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not.
[SPEAKER_04]: But very recently, then we are open
pollinated because we didn't receive many
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't have, for what we saw in the P1
generation, I didn't see any psychoactive
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: The plants were not resinous.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I smoke, they don't get you high.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cannabinoid analysis were under one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it looks, sounds and tastes like a
Hempest strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we are open pollinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we only discovered one plant that
was a Maphrodite, but all the plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: the rest of the plants that were sexually
stable, we open pollinated.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our first studies is, okay,
this is a Hempest strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we released them as a Hempest strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, it's not going to sell a lot
because our customers are more marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: type, but the ganja type that wants to get
high with the flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's interesting to, from the
pressure, from the preservation side to
[SPEAKER_04]: contribute with new hemp cultivars that no
one knows, except the Japanese.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Japanese have had a very
prohibitionist since the Second World War.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't comment anything about their
Japanese strains or they can be
[SPEAKER_04]: psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some studies, quite tall.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some land-based growers, they say,
yeah, Japanese, wow, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to buy you some plants and this and
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: More because from the preservation side
and because it's really exotic,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's psychoactive potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one grower, the P2 generation we
released, we are advertising it as a hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: with no relevant psychoactive or terpenic
value.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one grower that grew a few packs,
found a few resinous plants and a few
[SPEAKER_04]: plants that were smelling really good from
a few doses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he brought them to the lab and one of
them had 10% of CBD and 5% of THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad, not bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the others were, and the others
interesting were very low in THC,
[SPEAKER_04]: but a bit of CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the third type that was like the
one we found, like hemp, like very low THC
[SPEAKER_04]: and very low CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it really show that if we look for,
first that the strain has the potential to
[SPEAKER_04]: be more relevant for terpenes and
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with a bit of work, working to this
plant, to this kind of chemo type with
[SPEAKER_04]: more content, we can make it even
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it will need like back-crossing to
this type of plants, then inbreath.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inbreath line one, two, three generation
and then fix it to something more
[SPEAKER_04]: psychoactive or something only with CBD,
but more CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can be done, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It give a more interesting value to this
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, we chose discovery like two,
three months ago, thanks to a customer in
[SPEAKER_04]: United States that he's a legal hemp
grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he had a chance to grow a few doses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And realized that a few had a potential to
be psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in touch with him and maybe we
collaborate to hopefully increase the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoid enterpenes of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but definitely there's potential to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: How interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a future offering from the Japanese
hemp strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned preservation in there and
it kind of, got me thinking about a
[SPEAKER_01]: question I've been thinking about for
years now, which is for someone like
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself, who's looking to get pure land
race stock, what does the future of
[SPEAKER_01]: preservation look like to you in regards
to land race?
[SPEAKER_01]: Considering most people kind of say,
oh, you know, you can't find that pure
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you go to the reals, it's all
polluted now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think land race preservation
is going to be like going forward?
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing, obviously, many things has been
lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: But many things are left.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many things are left more than the indoor
cush waiting for us to, yeah, I think that
[SPEAKER_04]: is a pessimistic way to see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree that very interesting lines have
been lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you're not going to do anything to
really find out how many good ones are
[SPEAKER_04]: left and to try to preserve what is left.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to stop there only.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand this attitude.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's difficult because preservation how it
has grown up, the recreational and the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry doesn't give money.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the future will, in mid long term,
when this gets, when this industry gets
[SPEAKER_04]: more complicated, when the genetic
engineering starts, when only big
[SPEAKER_04]: companies that have this knowledge,
these machines, these qualified people,
[SPEAKER_04]: these patents, will be able, for that
profile of companies, then the different
[SPEAKER_04]: genotypes that the land races and the gen
pools that we are now looking at,
[SPEAKER_04]: these are the gen pool that will be very
important and with lot of value for these
[SPEAKER_04]: big companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in mid long term, at the moment,
and for the small companies, it has very
[SPEAKER_04]: little value because what is the big
trend?
[SPEAKER_04]: The cush, the cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is 80% of the business.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is 80% of the business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you concentrate in, if you want to
make money, you need to concentrate on
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why the seed banks are coping USA
and the Spanish seed bank allows to cope
[SPEAKER_04]: in USA because it's the next big thing in
USA is already there.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only way to, the commercial gen pool
is all has cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can call it with other name or cross
it with other name and give it another
[SPEAKER_04]: twist so it looks slightly better,
but it's a very narrow part of the gen
[SPEAKER_04]: pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the potential and the qualities of the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, preservation, I saw it since
the beginning, first as a passion for me
[SPEAKER_04]: to learn, to where is the roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the highway, we find it all mixed,
but where this, the taste of the skunk
[SPEAKER_04]: came, where the intents of the haze came,
where the color of this came.
[SPEAKER_04]: To understand all this from, from the
roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: What land races give these traits?
[SPEAKER_04]: And for me, it was passion for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was obvious that it has an immense
genetic value, something that can give you
[SPEAKER_04]: something new.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're always repeating the same,
it's very difficult that you came up with
[SPEAKER_04]: something entirely new one that can make a
new revolution on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: In science,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you are always repeating the same,
you always finish on the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to reach to new territories,
you must start from new things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for that, the land races, and
obviously it's the source of all the
[SPEAKER_04]: genetic diversity we enjoy right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the repository of the genetic
diversity, all this genetic widespread,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially in countries like India,
Nepal, Afghanistan, Pakistan, that they
[SPEAKER_04]: have such cannabis culture for hundreds,
centuries in so many parts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's incredible, the genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Stallone, India, Nepal, Afghanistan,
and Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the shorter revolution that have
been happening with the out-of-flowing
[SPEAKER_04]: revolution, the CBD revolution,
all these were traits that were very
[SPEAKER_04]: obvious and easy to get from land races,
from the out-of-flowing, from the stern
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp, for example, on the Russian hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the CBD, from the hasplant land race
cultivars, all the hasplant land race
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivars have CBD, the Moroccan,
the Afghani, the Lebanese, the Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the potential to find new things,
new cannabinoids, new terpenes,
[SPEAKER_04]: will come most probably from the example
of the land race, most probably.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rather, than the bottleneck gen pool that
the American industry is driving the gen
[SPEAKER_04]: pool nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great answer to a complex question.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're talking about genetics,
a different viewer wanted to know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was interested as well, what sort of
Lebanese stock do you work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how would you describe it to people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our listener was wondering, how often does
the red phenotype versus the blonde
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype show up in the regular seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people, I think most of our audience
knows, but I think it's good to point it
[SPEAKER_04]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually people associate or connect hash
with Indicas, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: With Afghani Pakistan, no?
[SPEAKER_04]: But many of the traditional hashes are
produced from Sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: The most excellent cases are the Chara
Sativas, the Nepalese, and the North
[SPEAKER_04]: Indians.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also, the Moroccan hash, and the
Lebanese hash that is used following the
[SPEAKER_04]: dry sieve metals used in Afghanistan,
Pakistan, are Sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: People confuse, and for some people,
it's difficult to understand that the
[SPEAKER_04]: Moroccan and the Lebanese are Sativas.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lebanese population we offer from the
United States came from a friend from
[SPEAKER_04]: Israel that in the 90s, there in Israel,
it's very easy to get Lebanese hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: But not so common to get with,
but sometimes he got with from the
[SPEAKER_04]: Bedouins that were smuggling some
products, and with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he saved the seeds, and he came
to live, to spend for a few years,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we keep in touch, and he served with
us, and with Charlie Erthia also,
[SPEAKER_04]: the seeds of these, this Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was working mainly by a friend of
mine called Raspablo, who did the first
[SPEAKER_04]: generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, it's a Sativa completely adapted
to the dry and hot climate of Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's extremely resistant against heat and
lack of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a test here outside, putting some
Lebanese plants in a pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually plants in a pot dehydrate easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here in some time, in Spain, 40 degrees,
and at the exit of the aircon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plants were receiving in the sun,
40 degrees, and the heat of the aircon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you understand?
[SPEAKER_04]: And with other plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: After one year, the indoor Afghani were,
you know, fading down.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lebanese were destroyed, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I showed you how resistant these
genetics are.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the pay, one generation, there were not
much seeds, like 30 or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my friend reproduced the line in a few
cycles, using a small population,
[SPEAKER_04]: but always removing the nephrodites,
and using a very nice female in every
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle with different females.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we came out with three lots from the
same males that were pollinated with many
[SPEAKER_04]: different males in each lot for the P2,
for the second generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we grail like 100.
[SPEAKER_04]: We put all the three lots.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where we're getting all,
and we put all the 100 plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, a lot of nephrodites.
[SPEAKER_04]: We came up throwing like 40, 50 plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and the Lebanese also has a high male
ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Lebanese usually produce quite a lot
of males.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, after removing males and
nephrodites, we left with 30, 40 females.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we managed to found sexually stable
females and males.
[SPEAKER_04]: The two main phenotypes, one more sativa
with long nodes that takes longer to
[SPEAKER_04]: flower in, 70 days, 74 indoors,
bigger yielding, more branchy type,
[SPEAKER_04]: thinner leaves, but still big,
with more tangy, fitric, mango,
[SPEAKER_04]: fruit eater pins.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's other phenome that is
smaller, more columnar, faster flowering,
[SPEAKER_04]: 55 days flowering or so, and more
colorful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Indoor, it turns purple, reddish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one, the aromas are quite
strange.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not so fruity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I prefer the taste and the effects
of the long flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the interesting thing of the Lebanese
is that most of the plants produce both
[SPEAKER_04]: TAC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are reaching both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for example, we found like balance
TAC, CBD one-to-one chemotypes,
[SPEAKER_04]: 7% TAC, 7% CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then once with very little TAC,
like 0.5 and 16 of CBD, and radius of 1 to
[SPEAKER_04]: 3, like 4% TAC to 12% CBD, radius of 1 to
TAC CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: The main interesting of the Lebanese is
it's a new source for CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has many interesting, rich CBD
chemotypes, and also some with the way
[SPEAKER_04]: with CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very resistant for outdoor places
with water restriction, with a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, people really like the effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many growers really like the effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not very strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: The potency is soft, moderate,
because it also has CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's really pleasant, very,
really happy, clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that sounds lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wanting to ask you, what land-race
genetics do you think are underrepresented
[SPEAKER_01]: within the cannabis culture, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I always think about haze and how
there's supposedly some Indian genetics in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think to myself, you never hear
about Indian.
[SPEAKER_01]: What to you do you think is really
underrepresented?
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, the main recreational gem
pool comes from genetics, the hybrids that
[SPEAKER_04]: were developed in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: The land-races that were used to develop
these hybrids depended a lot on the
[SPEAKER_04]: land-races that the people in the United
States receive, obviously.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end, in the United States,
they work mainly with Mexican,
[SPEAKER_04]: with Colombian, and Thai, a bit lesser,
and with Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the main gem pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the land-races that are more
prevalent in today's modern Western
[SPEAKER_04]: recreational gem pool, to say it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the ones that are underrated,
and that we should put more attention to,
[SPEAKER_04]: is, for example, the amazing work that
Erathening of Indian land-race chain is
[SPEAKER_04]: doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: To look at what we have discussed
previously, that India and Nepal is
[SPEAKER_04]: probably, and Afghanistan and Pakistan,
the most interesting places to look for
[SPEAKER_04]: biggest diversity, oldest land-races,
with older culture and more variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, yes, the Indian land-races,
the Nepalese land-races are not very
[SPEAKER_04]: prevalent in the gem pool that people are
smoking nowadays.
[SPEAKER_04]: And regarding Indicas, it's mainly
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe some Pakistani also made into the
North American gem pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's mostly Afghani.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Pakistan also has very interesting
Indicas to offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are other very interesting
Indicas in countries like Uzbekistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, interesting stuff, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next thing I wanted to ask you
about was something which a lot of fans
[SPEAKER_01]: asked me to follow up with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you ever plan to have any sort of
partnerships with any US seed banks?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of US growers that
really want your gear, but maybe find it
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hard to get it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's legalized on a federal level.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will try to establish there a legal
business and to look for partners there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think right now is the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have friends working there that have
helped me with selections and that I
[SPEAKER_04]: appreciate a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we never talked about making business
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we have so many retailers that see
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that the people in the United
States very used to have the product very
[SPEAKER_04]: easy to access within United States and
all this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But well, even in this globalized world,
things are not always so easy,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially regarding customs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to avoid problems that we don't
want problems at this time, we're not
[SPEAKER_04]: shipping to the United States,
but I don't think it will take much time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once they legalize federally and once we
do a few steps here to get FITO
[SPEAKER_04]: certificates for an exportation of the
seeds, I think they won't have any
[SPEAKER_04]: complaint to don't allow the importation
of the seeds there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be without any problem and
fluently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Until now, I would recommend to anyone
interested to look in the many retailers
[SPEAKER_04]: that see worldwide.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't do it because we want to be quite
the street with a law here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But many retailers are shipping everywhere
and it's very easy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having been able to get some of your seeds
myself, I'll let people know it is
[SPEAKER_01]: possible to get them via other means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of Australia, I wanted to ask
you, are you familiar with the Australian
[SPEAKER_01]: bastard cannabis plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, not much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you seen photos?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as you know, we are actually at
the other part of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Spain, we say if you make a hole,
you will appear in Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, for us, Australia is like woof.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super far, super far.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not something that we have in our
cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember when we overgrown, when some of
the Australian growers start to join us,
[SPEAKER_04]: the mulu batman, showing some mulu mimi
madness of five kilos plants that were
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I remember some very, very killer
Australian growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I knew about the mulu mimi
madness the elephant sativa, how some thai
[SPEAKER_04]: stick arrived.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of thai stick arrived in the 70s and
80s there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have very good sativa, the purple
nimbing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard and seen, but never smoked to
be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a pity.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's just because the distance
and because at the end, the Australian
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrids didn't make it into the Dutch
genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the North American genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a pity because many people say
very good things about mulu mimi madness.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't understand how after so many
years, no one came up with a good
[SPEAKER_04]: representation of a good mulu mimi madness
that could be spread around the world so
[SPEAKER_04]: people can get a touch of the fine flowers
and bread from the Australian growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really a pity, but it's obviously a
result of the prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you got a very valid point there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's really locked down the mulu mimi
madness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to ask you, I know that you
grow organically and we're very passionate
[SPEAKER_01]: about helping people to grow organically
on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: What sort of grow style do you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you just use basic amendments and you
just mix it in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do no till?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us a bit of a rundown on how you grow
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's extremely easy because for 20,
more than 20 years following the same soil
[SPEAKER_04]: mix recipe, I'm a soil grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an organic grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the outdoor buds over indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always use this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get a very high quality pit from a
cooperative here in Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have been buying this pit for 25
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's always the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, we put like 80, 90% of this
pit, then 10% of very high quality worm
[SPEAKER_04]: casting, then a bit of one of this depend
on the strain on the stage and the
[SPEAKER_04]: transplant.
[SPEAKER_04]: More for flowering, the guano.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a bit of cocoa, if it's a strain that
is slow with the roots, or if we want to
[SPEAKER_04]: speed up the first week, the first weeks,
a bit more of cocoa and this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then organic fertilizer, we use two
brands that here in Europe are very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very well known.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Kana.
[SPEAKER_04]: The organic line, the Bio Kana,
which is basically Kana Vega and Kana
[SPEAKER_04]: Flores.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Rhizotonic, which is marvelous for
transplants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like a lot the Bio Beads.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bio Grow, Bio Bloom, Bio Fish,
the fish one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I basically usually use this one for 25
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the taste and the feeling and the
vibration of how it came out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I don't need anything more.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's room for improvement regarding
yield, but I don't like to use chemical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes very neutral the taste and harsh
and gives a bad vibration that I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: like in the high, like a toxic feeling in
the high that I don't like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also I don't use much of these new era
flowering stimulators that they,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: More, more, more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just use one and a basic organic
fertilizer for flowering and that's all.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not bad bastards and all this,
no.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping it simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next question I wanted to ask,
you was, do you have any seeds in your
[SPEAKER_01]: stash that you're really excited to look
through next?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's the next thing you're excited
to look on, to look into?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah, I have a list.
[SPEAKER_04]: Somewhere there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we have a cashmere, a cashmere has
plant that one of my colleagues got from a
[SPEAKER_04]: hippie, a Spanish hippie that lives there
for decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have done a couple of generation of
this has plant from cashmere and it's very
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's job to do because there are
different chemo types.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some Hermes, but there are some
very interesting expression like very
[SPEAKER_04]: rationals, white leaf, colors,
very interesting terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's quite interesting this
cashmere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then some sativa seeds that a friend of
mine that is a scientist dealer brought me
[SPEAKER_04]: from the Caribbean, from San Martin
Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very, very small island in the
Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_04]: He told me that after going across the
whole Atlantic that he finished all the
[SPEAKER_04]: joints and they reached to San Martin
first in America.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he got in touch with a rasta
there that was growing super crazy sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like things live like needles,
my friend told me.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good enough to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: A good tropical from the Caribbean that
doesn't contain indigo, doesn't be
[SPEAKER_04]: contaminated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I have some interesting Colombian.
[SPEAKER_04]: One Chilean, old Chilean man, he used to
work for the ENCODE.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know the ENCODE?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how it's called in English.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Department of the United Nation
for Drug Studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: They make some studies in Latin America of
the drug production area and their
[SPEAKER_04]: relationship with the cultures and the
minorities.
[SPEAKER_04]: The group there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this person was part of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he was in contact with many Colombian
growers, all the school Colombian growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he brought me Punto Rojo, Santa Marta
Gold, and a Mango Viche.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the one I want to have more will to
explore is maybe the Santa Marta.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I have different seeds from Sri
Lanka.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know one that a hippie here from my
village that is half Sri Lankan,
[SPEAKER_04]: brought from Sri Lanka, very small seeds,
ultra long flowering, sativa, four,
[SPEAKER_04]: five months of flowering.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have another Sri Lanka, but these
are more fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I got others from Sri Lanka in 2017.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I traveled there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And others that I'm quite curious and that
I would like to, within the fridge is also
[SPEAKER_04]: one that Azure, one friend from my CMAG
sent me is the Papua New Guinea.
[SPEAKER_04]: This I'm very, very curious to explore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't explored the sativa from Papua.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was there in 2019 for holidays,
but I couldn't get with.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a nice list.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some projects ongoing this year,
which is to bring back the Pure China
[SPEAKER_04]: Yunnan and hopefully to bring the Pure
Taichung Mai.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there'll be a lot of demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually the Chinese, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: The long flowering plants give you to say,
you know, more reputation than sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: People, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: One more time.
[SPEAKER_04]: This and that, this and that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the truth is that very, very few
growers willing to grow sativa that take
[SPEAKER_04]: four or five months to flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very, very small market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only the hardcore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, while we're talking about long
flowering sativas, I really wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: you about how you got the old timer haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that go about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how would you describe the old timer
haze?
[SPEAKER_04]: The old timer haze is a very unique line.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the most extreme tropical
sativa I ever had the pleasure to
[SPEAKER_04]: experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how to describe it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Finnish produce is like it comes from
two centuries ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you show a bottle of old timer haze to
all these cookies guys and all this,
[SPEAKER_04]: they don't know how to take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a completely different thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 200% sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cross old timer haze with an indica
and they all come still 100% sativa.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really extreme.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very tropical.
[SPEAKER_04]: From seed, it could take six months to
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: The clones we have are really old.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are 15 years old.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they are a bit faster.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, they are very, very wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very wild.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you know to know more specifically
about old timer haze?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess something I'm interested in is how
did you get that stock from old timer?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how did the different phenotypes
differ?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it mostly just the color or are they
actually quite different?
[SPEAKER_04]: The old timer haze, there are two main
phenomes, the green and the purple haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: They grow and flower almost the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: The difference is only in the second half
of flowering and in the Finnish product.
[SPEAKER_04]: But during the whole growth, early
flowering, they look essentially green.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they are grown outdoors in a cold
weather, usually in October, with the cold
[SPEAKER_04]: nights, the colorful phenotypes start to
show.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually showing a bit of the purple veins,
reddish tones.
[SPEAKER_04]: And depending on how cold is your weather,
it just means that through the flowering,
[SPEAKER_04]: the nights are lower than 15 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this happened in tropics and
subtropical.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened in most temperate latitudes,
even with a good climate like the
[SPEAKER_04]: Mediterranean.
[SPEAKER_04]: Regarding Finnish product, the green haze
is super clean, super euphoric.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bit like the New Caledonia Just
Smoke, that you feel everything more
[SPEAKER_04]: amplified, you are more alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want to do things, you have a lot
of energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: The purple haze and the green haze smell
like ancient wood, spices, incense.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to describe it like the backpack of
a backpacker after traveling one month in
[SPEAKER_04]: India and coming back with incense and
spices and all the dirty clothes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the smell of the old thermal haze,
the green phenome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, the green haze, even with cold
temperatures, even freezing temps,
[SPEAKER_04]: is completely ripe green.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then the purple haze, with the colder
nights in October, November, December,
[SPEAKER_04]: start to show more, more, more color,
more color.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually they show a mix of red and purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, also the purple phenome have more
like red wine, brandy, kind of alcoholic
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: More berry, blackberry, strawberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could have also the incense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the smoke is also very, very cerebral.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all in the head.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's more introspective than the green
haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how did you get the seed stock
initially?
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, the seeds came from Ultamer,
which is one of the pioneer breeders in
[SPEAKER_04]: the UK.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's an old person and he was in touch
with the first marijuana movement and the
[SPEAKER_04]: first hippies traveling and exchanging
seeds that came from Asia.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he also traveled to the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, he got different haze lines that
he collected himself that are not derived
[SPEAKER_04]: from some scubmine.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least directly, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that all the original haze is the
haze that some scubmine brought in the
[SPEAKER_04]: mid-1980s to Holland.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is supposedly a pure haze line
collected by Ultamer, another person,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that has been preserved parallel to
original haze from some scumbag.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ultamer told me that he had three lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because he gave away to people to
reproduce but never, no one did.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end, he lost it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He used to breed in the UK, so he can only
breed indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Ultamer were too extreme for the
breeding goals and needs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he made a few hybrids with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he ended up losing his pure haze
population.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the end, only one person.
[SPEAKER_04]: One person that was called Pacific was one
of the persons that received the pure haze
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds from him, from Ultamer, and he did a
small reproduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: At that time, he gave away seeds to,
in cannabis world, I think it was,
[SPEAKER_04]: yes, to different people, to people like
Santibaba, to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were not many seeds left.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Ultamer appreciated us,
cherished us, and he gave us, and knew
[SPEAKER_04]: that we were really passionate with
Santibaba.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he gave us like 40 or 50 seeds from the
Pacific reproduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those were, I don't have any record or
news that anyone grew more Ultamer haze
[SPEAKER_04]: from the original channel buds,
from the original channel buds,
[SPEAKER_04]: or that anyone preserved any other haze
line from Ultamer different than this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only the world we did is what remains
alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very highly sought after strain in
terms of the cult following.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as a random side question,
did Ultamer ever talk to you about giving
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics to Sam the skunk man or being
involved in the skunk project?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I cannot say now that he say that
he work in the skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: He never say that he work.
[SPEAKER_04]: To develop the haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: He only say that he got seeds coming from
haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: What others are saying, I prefer not to
go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all polemic about things that I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are a fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I prefer not to go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just as a sort of general question,
what's your favorite offering from ace
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could only pick one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: For others or for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: How about do one for each?
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was for me, I would touch it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Touching for me is the noise.
[SPEAKER_04]: Press all my buttons and make me feel
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what I call a spiritual weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really magic weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very special and intense.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, it's magic weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for others, if you want, I wanted to
impress someone and don't know anything
[SPEAKER_04]: about or sativas and something that is
grow panamacros, bangy, haze, phem.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you will get a good introduction into
our work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two really solid offerings there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hoping I could ask you a little bit
about the Panama red line you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed obviously it's an F10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like a lot of works gone into
this project.
[SPEAKER_01]: What sort of traits were you looking for
in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you have any plans to breed with it
more in the future?
[SPEAKER_04]: The Panama strain is probably the strain
we have worked longer, more generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And probably for long term lines is
probably the best one.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the merit on this line came from
the job of Kaiki or Charlie Garcia.
[SPEAKER_04]: He did the most difficult generation and
to put it at a level that is incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Panama is a Panama hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: It started in the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was a grower, amateur breeder in the
Overgrow forums that he was a friend of
[SPEAKER_04]: mine, Charlie Garcia.
[SPEAKER_04]: His name was Green Grocer.
[SPEAKER_04]: He used to grow Panama lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: He had a hybrid of a Panama, old Panama
green.
[SPEAKER_04]: And an old Panama red line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he worked maybe one, two generations
this hybrid, Green Grocer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then he passed the genetics to Charlie
Garcia, to Kaiki from Cannabio Hem when we
[SPEAKER_04]: were working the first years of eight
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we took a third Panama hybrid
Colombian red strain from Alex Mano Negra.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we put several red males from this
third Red Estativa male into the two-way
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrid, making a three-way hybrid.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Kaiki wore the hybrid in at least
until the F6, F7.
[SPEAKER_04]: Until 2006,
[SPEAKER_04]: Kaiki did the most difficult job is the
Panama is like to capture the best traits
[SPEAKER_04]: of the best Panama reds in a strain that
can be grown with modern standards and
[SPEAKER_04]: compete with resin, terpenes, potency,
bag appeal, quality, with the modern
[SPEAKER_04]: strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an extremely good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't say likely that is the best
Peru-Sativa, Central American Sativa breed
[SPEAKER_04]: of the last 20 years, because it is
amazing quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has different phenols.
[SPEAKER_04]: The red ones, the green ones, some that
have so much resin that is white.
[SPEAKER_04]: Purple one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kaiki wore the Charlie Garcia wore the
Panama until the F6, F7.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I start to work with the line on
2006, 2007.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did like two or three generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the time that I work better,
myself, the Panama was in 2013.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I put like seven different Panama
lines from F6 to F10.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we selected among 100 different
females.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I came up with the Panama goddess
F10 elite, which is my work after Kaiki,
[SPEAKER_04]: after Charlie Garcia of a mix of his elite
Panama red, the elite Panama red we had at
[SPEAKER_04]: that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mix it with greens that I like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then work three, four, five
generations more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the line, the main parental plan
we use for Panama breeding is the Panama
[SPEAKER_04]: goddess.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an F10, sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's elite.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has everything I want.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably not the most radius,
but regarding GL type of effect,
[SPEAKER_04]: quality of the effect, terpenes is the
best female I have seen until now.
[SPEAKER_04]: After 20 years working with Panama.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was hoping to clarify.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that the Pakistani Chitrali Kush
Breeder pack, it kind of had a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different phenotypes listed in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that similar to how you were talking
about doing like the different zamels
[SPEAKER_01]: where they sort of like unreleased mothers
and you're including them in this pack
[SPEAKER_01]: that aren't normally in the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how would you describe the other
Pakistani mothers compared to the usual
[SPEAKER_01]: one you use?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: The concept of the breeder packs is more
addressed to big breeders.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a big growers that want to make a big
selection to find that really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really outstanding plan to keep as a clone
and keep for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: These people that wants to go into one of
our strain as much as deep and wide as
[SPEAKER_04]: possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the breeder pack, its strain is
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So its breeder pack is different.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I try to offer is seeds from the
different baselines that represent the
[SPEAKER_04]: strain.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, in the case of the Panama
breeder packs will be to put good that the
[SPEAKER_04]: grower can easily find good seeds from the
Panama green.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the Panama of the red, pink piece
still from the latest job we have done
[SPEAKER_04]: with the strain coming from the Panama
goddess, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have with the Cali China with
different lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are cautions.
[SPEAKER_04]: One half slightly different terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other different, slightly different
effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you, for example, want to,
oh, in the Pakistan, which is the Pakistan
[SPEAKER_04]: that has been used more in the industry to
produce colorful hybrids, whatever they
[SPEAKER_04]: want to put on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know it's PCK.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so easy to, because it's the parental
plan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been working 15 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like recognize one, one of my
daughters.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for example, if you want to breed with
Pakistan, Chitrakoos and wait in a more
[SPEAKER_04]: proper way, you take the breeder pack and
from the green line, I focus to find the
[SPEAKER_04]: best from the green.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the best purple for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the black one, very red phenotype,
even the colorful ones, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: And depending on the reproduction we have
done, and what have been the most
[SPEAKER_04]: remarkable plants, then I make a breeder
pack that provides the best from the last
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding step usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there we go, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do the big phenohunt,
you know where to look.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're now onto our final quickfire
questions, which we ask all breeders at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first question I wanted to ask you
was, if you could go back 10 years and
[SPEAKER_01]: give yourself some advice relating to
cannabis, what would you tell yourself?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's poetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next question we ask, yes,
is what is the single most memorable bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis you ever smoked, be it flower,
hash, whatever it is, what's the most
[SPEAKER_01]: memorable for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: The most memorable.
[SPEAKER_04]: The most memorable that I cherish in my
memory a lot is the Nepalese Kalmandu,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is one of the few land races I grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was flowered with purple, pinkish hues.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was such a delicate plant that followed
with its delicate colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it smelled like wild strawberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you smoke it, it was intense,
like being in Nepal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were children.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they say, my God, this weed from Nepal
is incredible, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then also with the tripe from the Pirzamas
and the first tamalweed we did,
[SPEAKER_04]: like incredible tripe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Incredible tripe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then other strengths I miss a lot are the
funny Mexican effects that make you laugh
[SPEAKER_04]: with your friends, like a bit like the New
Caledonia, just more like it makes you
[SPEAKER_04]: smile and improve your mood.
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss these kinds of effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're very seldom finding it today,
in today's weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Other strengths I smoke, very interesting
purple sativas in Northern Laos,
[SPEAKER_04]: in Van Dieng, that was very strong and
unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: I never tried anything like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I smoke when I was in Utsumatra
in Oranje.
[SPEAKER_04]: Orangutan Reserve.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to, they would like to try the
Acerol, is how we call it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Americans, I guess, they put gold to
everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was black.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was just, the truth is true,
and I haven't smoked in a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was on holidays.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I was there in the dark,
in the jungle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the, that was traveling with a
group, got some of the local weed from
[SPEAKER_04]: Northern Utsumatra, from Matsi.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were black fermented thing that
almost had no bracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was only leaf and sticks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we make one or two years,
and we said between three and four.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was extremely, extremely strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you grow these properly, we could
flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you let it rip, because the flower we
smoke wasn't ripe.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's one of the strongest land
races I have experienced in Northern
[SPEAKER_04]: Utsumatra.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another I cherish, from the commercial
strains, the first maple leaf that smell
[SPEAKER_04]: like baby shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Incredible terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the best haze hybrids from
the 90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Yagheri is a masterpiece.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Hawaiian haze, it was incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only tried once, but it was probably one
of the most trippy and terpy and best
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrids from Neville.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kalimis, the old Kalimis from Sirius
and Simon, it was spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was spectacular.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, one Philippine Kalimis from
Cordillera Centralis that tastes like a
[SPEAKER_04]: jasmine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was purple and tastes like jasmine.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are probably the land races and
commercial strains that I cherish more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And had more impact on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an awesome list you've got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next question I wanted to know was,
if you were going to get dropped off on a
[SPEAKER_01]: desert island and you could only take
three strains with you for the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: time, what three strains are you going to
take with you?
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be Thamaldelica, Panama,
Crossbunky Hayes, and Tai Chi.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just very, very sativa dominant
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have you ever had a strain where all
your friends are telling you about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting very excited to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it finally comes time to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you feel like this isn't very good at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite disappointing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens to me very frequently with all
the new strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest with the GG4, all these
cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they look good.
[SPEAKER_04]: They look very good, but it doesn't tell
me anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the kind of smoke that I like to
smoke in the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, people are crazy about all these
weeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But honestly, you put me in New Caledonia.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can only smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: The course in New Caledonia, to give you
an example, I will take the New Caledonia
[SPEAKER_04]: back.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can keep all the course you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the final question for our chat today.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could go back in time, any place,
any point in history to collect some
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, where would you go and what seeds
would you collect?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would go to Thailand in the seventies to
get the true Thai stick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombians in this life I already have.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, definitely I will go to Colombia.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will go to get the Finnish Colombians
from the sixties and seventies.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Afghani before all the mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the wars in Afghanistan from the
sixties and seventies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the most are still alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially in Asia and Africa,
where it was really old to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good news.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm still positive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the time to see people like Rathini
from India Landry exchange.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to see them so active.
[SPEAKER_04]: They should be the ones to do this and not
a westerner.
[SPEAKER_04]: The westerner, even if he goes to Thailand
or Africa or India, is not going to get
[SPEAKER_04]: the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Only the locals.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from Valencia.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're only going to eat the best paella
in the world if you are from Valencia and
[SPEAKER_04]: your grandma cook is for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot pretend to go to any place and
come back with the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally it was the moment that the people
from the traditional farmers and people
[SPEAKER_04]: from those countries start to understand
the value and the importance of the
[SPEAKER_04]: preservation of their gene pools.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they are very united with their
with many of their traditional life and
[SPEAKER_04]: lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And who can do this better than the local
people?
[SPEAKER_04]: And who should do it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethically and morally others first than
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's amazing what they are doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why the races we're trying to
support the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Indian Landry exchange are doing to to
document the land races.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the countries that have more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And showing us that there are still so
many left.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are still so many things in
cannabis to discover.
[SPEAKER_04]: That shows the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, that's why I like to support the
people I like here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm extremely excited with every project
they do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, I think the future already is
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that the legalization is coming to all
these countries that people try to empower
[SPEAKER_04]: their local strengths and try to preserve
what we have left.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then try to to develop new strengths.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something really new.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a fantastic answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end of the episode today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there any comments or shout outs you
wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many ups and downs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has been very hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have had to sacrifice many things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we did it because we love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we wanted because it was all
passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we wanted to contribute with
something.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really appreciate how.
[SPEAKER_04]: How the genetics in some growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how happy makes people.
[SPEAKER_04]: How happy this is making me feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really beautiful thing and it's
very creative.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of love involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, this industry is not easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I probably I never did all the things
always.
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently, I'm not just a human.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just try to be as much good person as I
can be and give the best of me in my work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Without you, it would never happen.
