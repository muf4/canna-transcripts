[SPEAKER_00]: Not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we just made it down to Los Angeles
down in Orange County here We've been kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of on a little trip my teacher and a few
other other venerables from His Holiness
[SPEAKER_04]: the Dalai Lama's monastery Namgyal
monastery are down here where They're here
[SPEAKER_04]: finalizing some things for a project that
my teachers heading It's a library museum
[SPEAKER_04]: project of His Holiness the Dalai Lama and
that's gonna be an Ithaca, New York,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we're starting a center down here also
in Westminster area Orange County area for
[SPEAKER_04]: His Holiness the Dalai Lama.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're gonna have a small center here
as well And they're just finalizing some
[SPEAKER_04]: things with that and also with a library
museum project that's gonna break ground
[SPEAKER_00]: in May Wow, that must be a really sort of
exciting time for you and the people
[SPEAKER_00]: around you I guess the question it brings
to mind to me is that there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people out there who Quite into Buddhism
quite into sort of Eastern spirituality.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel that interplays with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like there's overlap there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, of course, um, well for one there's
they're theorizing now that the true home
[SPEAKER_04]: of the cannabis plant is in the Tibetan
Plateau, so They're now finding source
[SPEAKER_04]: origins that that was one of the first
places that it was so and in a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: you know deeper Esoteric studies of
Buddhism Hinduism Jainism these different
[SPEAKER_04]: things there's been talk and utilization
of cannabis and in a multitude of
[SPEAKER_04]: different ways also in Taoism and Chinese
herbal pharmacophagy These kind of things
[SPEAKER_04]: that we've been utilizing this plant
medicinally and spiritually for thousands
[SPEAKER_04]: of years, you know humans on all levels,
but In Buddhism, especially there's
[SPEAKER_04]: there's certain practices and certain
Things that there was association with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis in the form of bong, which is a
basically a steeped milk drink that they
[SPEAKER_04]: use cannabis so there were some practices
that Basically, you drink the whole bottle
[SPEAKER_04]: of bong you get locked in this rock hut
You have you do this particular practice
[SPEAKER_04]: have this particular experience and then
you know, so that's it's it's been
[SPEAKER_04]: utilized in them in Buddhism and in a
multitude of other Religions for thousands
[SPEAKER_04]: of years from my understanding even I mean
when you talk about the You know with
[SPEAKER_04]: Jesus and the holy anointed oil,
you know from all of our understanding
[SPEAKER_04]: that was cannabis oil, you know,
so you know people say what they want and
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever, but when you start researching
and start studying what was being used
[SPEAKER_04]: What oil was a prized medicinal oil an
anointing oil a healing oil back then it
[SPEAKER_00]: all started pointing towards cannabis Wow,
I mean we've had past guests talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: bong such as Irizen who gave us a little
bit of a rundown of how that plays into
[SPEAKER_00]: the Indian culture but a really
interesting point you just brought up is
[SPEAKER_00]: how It the the the sort of ceremony you
just described Sort of has a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: parallels with like sort of the way people
are really getting into ayahuasca these
[SPEAKER_00]: days Have you ever seen that or notice
that yourself?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh for sure I've you know, personally,
I've drinking ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know there 30 40 times.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was part of my Preliminary studies and
practices, you know about 20 years ago I
[SPEAKER_04]: actually wanted to be a shaman,
you know I thought I was gonna be one of
[SPEAKER_04]: those guys You know till my first teacher
you know kind of laughed at my face and
[SPEAKER_04]: you know stated clearly how how stupid
that was and so I didn't do that and
[SPEAKER_04]: instead went you know utilize the plant
that I already have a deep relationship
[SPEAKER_04]: with and Went full force into that but
utilizing these plants San Pedro cactus
[SPEAKER_04]: ayahuasca salvia these different things to
kind of disentangle the egoic you know
[SPEAKER_04]: anchor to some degree soften up the You
know attachments from all your
[SPEAKER_04]: self-centeredness and give you a self
observation Format to a degree to where
[SPEAKER_04]: you can start seeing how fake you are
yourself or how you're not one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: other, you know or both So For us,
you know the ayahuasca and especially when
[SPEAKER_04]: I talk about this drink Hong it was
associated with a practice called
[SPEAKER_04]: Mahakala, which is a wrathful amination of
Buddha of compassion It's a protector,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's a it's in a wrathful form of
compassion so which The the image of this
[SPEAKER_04]: this six armed wrathful protector is
holding a skull cup of a Reddish fluid
[SPEAKER_04]: they call rock tea But you know,
we always make jokes of that's ayahuasca,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know for years, you know But that
being said When you have a full-fledged
[SPEAKER_04]: Full-blown cannabis Ingestion experience,
you know, we all under I mean anyone
[SPEAKER_04]: that's eating too much cannabis
understands that that it's it's about as
[SPEAKER_04]: strong as it gets, you know ayahuasca
obviously with the dimethyltryptamine and
[SPEAKER_04]: the MAO inhibitor from the benisteriopsis
copy, you know, basically the chacruna has
[SPEAKER_04]: the DMT alkaloid and benisteriopsis copy
the vine has the MAO inhibitor So that
[SPEAKER_04]: induces a certain experience that's unique
to those things but from my experience
[SPEAKER_04]: when you get into Say the you know the
apex of any experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of similarities there So the
apex of an ayahuasca experience versus the
[SPEAKER_04]: apex of a heavy cannabis experience and
through ingestion They're quite different
[SPEAKER_04]: But esoterically and emotionally you can
have a similar experience of you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: death experience Come, you know heavy
self-observation analytical annihilation
[SPEAKER_04]: of your You know or an empowerment of you
know Some people they don't utilize the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant in the appropriate way and it just
empowers their ego You know, we've seen
[SPEAKER_04]: these kooky wannabe shamans or Also,
you know, I mean we're really familiar
[SPEAKER_04]: with the cannabis industry so we can just
use that You know, there's never I've
[SPEAKER_04]: never seen Any other industry in the world
and any other continuum of Business that
[SPEAKER_04]: it can that a plant can promote such an
ego Such I'm the best such a you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm better than everyone else I'm what I
have is better than yours.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's I haven't seen that in any other any
other things so then I look at cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: like odds and maybe exacerbates the ego in
a lot of ways or annihilates and
[SPEAKER_04]: Disentangles the ego in a lot of ways So
it's a quite unique parallel that it has
[SPEAKER_04]: ayahuasca on the other hand you know for
me personally it was more of a You know
[SPEAKER_04]: holodeck of all my karmic experience and I
was able to see the beginning point of a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of my issues and why they were Started
why it got conditioned a certain way with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't able to see it so clearly but
more in a Undertone was there,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it happens in a way it's just
happens in a different way, but a similar
[SPEAKER_04]: result can manifest in my perspective of
Humbleness subdued subdued ego these kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of things that happen from both,
you know ayahuasca happens for me happened
[SPEAKER_04]: a little more richly you know because I
Had it to the point of death experiences
[SPEAKER_04]: shamanic death kind of style things which
that's hard to do some cannabis At least
[SPEAKER_04]: for me, I'll just go to sleep,
you know Versus ayahuasca you have a death
[SPEAKER_04]: experience and you pass out because you
think you're dying sometimes because you
[SPEAKER_04]: can't breathe you're asphyxiating through
hyperventilation and and You know panic
[SPEAKER_04]: attack kind of thing so you can pass out
through that experience So when for me
[SPEAKER_04]: personally when I've had those level of
experiences because my teacher was kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: a freak He would take we would get
ayahuasca from the shipibo and In the
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazon jungle he would take that ayahuasca
and he would reduce it by 75% So if you
[SPEAKER_04]: have a leader, then you'd put it down to a
quarter liter And then he'd give that so
[SPEAKER_04]: we you know the times I've had certain
doses They've been high doses of that kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of concentrated medicine to where you're
say taking 200 milliliters, but in all
[SPEAKER_04]: actuality, it's near a liter you're
drinking so that's that induces a
[SPEAKER_04]: different type of experience that Our our
crew is It's very integral to our crew so
[SPEAKER_04]: You know if you can't have a shamanic
death, you can't have these death
[SPEAKER_04]: experiences then Your perspective of who
you are we feel is kind of limited because
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't get to see who you are when you
have a death, you know So once you do get
[SPEAKER_04]: to see who you are when you have a death
and see who you're not It um, it opens a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of information for you opens a lot of
awareness to your own mind and how you can
[SPEAKER_04]: work with yourself, so I Mean both of
those things come from my perspective from
[SPEAKER_04]: ayahuasca and from cannabis just in
different forms different formats
[SPEAKER_04]: different message different delivery but
in the end a similar result so Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: what a great little rundown on the
comparisons and differences between the
[SPEAKER_00]: two and so much of what you said Really
resonates with things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been noticing in the community,
especially how you talk about Canada the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community Or the plant kind of
has this uncanny ability to draw in people
[SPEAKER_00]: who?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tend to be quite focused on ego and the
thing I've noticed recently is that I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's very little Consideration
given to alternative perspectives within
[SPEAKER_00]: the scene, especially when you've got say
two people who are having a disagreement
[SPEAKER_00]: There's often very little room for
considering the other person's point of
[SPEAKER_00]: view What do you think it is about
cannabis that does that compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelics you kind of reference dosage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got me thinking is it is the
problem that with when smoking cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: generally speaking You can't get a dose
big enough to really approach that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: ego death Which you can with say ayahuasca
and maybe you can approach it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean I think a lot of people with
these like thousand milligram edibles have
[SPEAKER_04]: had that experience now, you know because
they'll eat the whole candy bar,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know and from my perspective when
something's extracted with hexane or
[SPEAKER_04]: extracted with a you know a Hydrocarbon
and then made into an edible Something
[SPEAKER_04]: happens something different happens from
my perspective, you know, so there's all
[SPEAKER_04]: these different Avenues of extraction
they're gonna promote a different type of
[SPEAKER_04]: result versus if you're doing a organic
ethanol extraction or whether you're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: a you know water separation ice hash and
then taking that product and putting it
[SPEAKER_04]: into MCT oil and then Eating that you
know, there's there's all kinds of
[SPEAKER_04]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something to be considered as
well, you know and I think that a Strain
[SPEAKER_04]: specific, you know is something for me
most of the strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to smoke are gonna induce a high
mentation capacity analytical thought or
[SPEAKER_04]: hyper analytical thought or hyper critical
thought so this kind of Experience that's
[SPEAKER_04]: induced from certain strains doesn't work
for some people and maybe someone that
[SPEAKER_04]: might you know be more CBD or indica prone
they smoke a high-end sativa or a high-end
[SPEAKER_04]: hybrid Sativa and they're having a panic
attack thinking all kinds of weird
[SPEAKER_04]: thoughts, you know, like they took LSD or
something So it depends on the person,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know One of the things my first
teacher always told me is it's all you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, every person has to know their
vehicle What works best for them what
[SPEAKER_04]: foods work best for them, you know Does
drinking lots of water work for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it not does eating lots of meat work
for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it not does eating lots of veg work
for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it not you know, so really analyzing
your body and analyzing the fuels you're
[SPEAKER_04]: putting in it You know is really
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for us You know organics is a big a big
facet in our life and every aspect of food
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis all these type of things so You
know, I think cultivation methods I think
[SPEAKER_04]: environmental factors all these things are
gonna lead to a certain experience or a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain Experience with the plant,
you know certain awareness level or not,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know when we talk about people's
opinions And their inability to find
[SPEAKER_04]: balance in a conversation when there's
disagreement You know, it's obviously it's
[SPEAKER_04]: hard in the cannabis industry because I
mean it's hard in all aspects of society
[SPEAKER_04]: these days, you know People can't disagree
with each other without getting in a
[SPEAKER_04]: fight.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like it's like not cool to
disagree anymore It's not cool to think
[SPEAKER_04]: different and you know, that's I think
that's maybe a more of a societal thing
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially in Western societies where
they're taught everything they think is
[SPEAKER_04]: special They're special their view is
special their perspective is special all
[SPEAKER_04]: this kind of thing In actuality,
it's just perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not special.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not special any being is not more
special than any other being You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just not how it works and the reality
of this universe but ideologies and
[SPEAKER_04]: conditioning through Western mindsets
through other aspects of mindsets have
[SPEAKER_04]: reinforced and conditioned this type of
specialness into everyone where I think
[SPEAKER_04]: we're experiencing that especially in the
cannabis industry because this plant will
[SPEAKER_04]: exacerbate that The ego or delineate the
ego one or the other and so when two
[SPEAKER_04]: people disagree It's it's really hard
especially in our industry for them to
[SPEAKER_04]: find some type of balance and common
ground because you know Most people aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: skilled in doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most people aren't skilled in psychology
and philosophy Most people aren't skilled
[SPEAKER_04]: in these kind of esoteric studies that are
basically based on recognizing the self
[SPEAKER_04]: Recognizing the problems of that it
creates and recognizing the solutions To
[SPEAKER_04]: eliminate those problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not something that's taught openly
in the Western culture, you know in
[SPEAKER_04]: Buddhist culture and in Asian cultures It
is you know and in the philosophies it is
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's because we don't believe in
a self like Western philosophies do we
[SPEAKER_04]: don't believe in this we believe it as an
illusory thing that's created through
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions, you know, so in that context
text it can also be Destroyed through
[SPEAKER_04]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we don't because we don't believe it's
a inherent thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We believe it's based off of Dependence
through other conditions hence it being a
[SPEAKER_04]: result So we don't believe it's something
that's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we believe it's something that can be
analyzed and destroyed Versus other
[SPEAKER_04]: religions and other mindsets.
[SPEAKER_04]: They believe this self is there the soul
is special you're special and that's I
[SPEAKER_04]: think personally a big part of That why in
the Western world we can't disagree
[SPEAKER_04]: happily.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't be like no, that's what you think
Well, here's what I think and everyone be
[SPEAKER_04]: like, wow, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have different thoughts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have different views That's okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean it's another thing if
we're trying to talk about him,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Truth because a lot of Western
cultures now think that their perspective
[SPEAKER_04]: is truth and their truth, you know and And
we all know that's not true You know your
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective is your opinion based off
conditioning based off awareness Or
[SPEAKER_04]: ignorances that are developed through your
life pattern, you know So then you have
[SPEAKER_04]: this perspective and until you can
recognize that as such.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard to annihilate such a thing It's
hard to recognize such a thing as a
[SPEAKER_04]: problem, you know, so You know,
it's a it's a there's a lot of aspects to
[SPEAKER_04]: a cultural, you know, and also
Plant-based, you know and from our
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective Karma base meaning the result
of our actions, you know A lot of us make
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of actions in our younger life eat a
lot of poor food impute a lot of negative
[SPEAKER_04]: information into our brain and then Later
in life.
[SPEAKER_04]: We say hey, we want to do something
special.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to be a good person we want but we
realize our actions don't align with that
[SPEAKER_04]: all of our conditioning and all of our
study and all of our Work that we put in
[SPEAKER_04]: for the last however many decades or years
We realized was done towards the wrong
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was done towards money.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was done towards success instead of
done towards empathy done towards
[SPEAKER_04]: open-hearted It's done towards compassion
and helping others, you know the things
[SPEAKER_04]: that actually You know are gonna help this
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can see like someone like Jeff Bezos,
you know through this whole kovat endeavor
[SPEAKER_04]: He cashed out really hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is he helping anyone not a person?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so All that money all that
wealth all that success But he doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have a speck of empathy So is he
successful?
[SPEAKER_04]: He seems like a troll then, you know Seems
not even like he's worth to be alive on
[SPEAKER_04]: earth, you know because if you Have that
much money and success and you don't help
[SPEAKER_04]: and change this planet your garbage,
you know, so I think these things aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: Being promoted heavily in society or I
think they should you know And I think
[SPEAKER_04]: that's one thing a lot of us are finding
with this plant is that it kind of engages
[SPEAKER_04]: this compassionate empathetic mind in us
to where we can see this and others where
[SPEAKER_04]: we can see people need help where we can
want to help where we can see this plants
[SPEAKER_04]: going to help or You know, we can buy more
Rolexes and New car, you know show it all
[SPEAKER_04]: off on IG, you know, like or we can do it
that style You know, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: different styles, you know But I think
it's based more off of the conditions of
[SPEAKER_04]: society and where we're headed and where
we are versus, you know Versus the plants
[SPEAKER_04]: influence towards that I guess Yeah,
most certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's so much of what you said
there that I've been noticing myself
[SPEAKER_00]: recently particularly that You know a lot
of people yeah never really given a formal
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to learn about how to be
self-reflective And consider where they
[SPEAKER_00]: fit into the picture and how their actions
influence things and kind of on that line
[SPEAKER_00]: of thinking I've noticed recently that at
least from my perspective there appears to
[SPEAKER_00]: be some medicine coming from an unlikely
place kind of traditionally the sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram trolls like clout King and Stan
the man these guys who historically I just
[SPEAKER_00]: thought maybe provided a bit of a laugh
Recently, I feel like they've kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe inadvertently started helping people
realize this and I know this when clout
[SPEAKER_00]: King came out with some branded cannabis,
which he was calling turds and then
[SPEAKER_00]: another line called jade's and I was like
It kind of seems a bit like sarcastic and
[SPEAKER_00]: ironic on face value But I think he's
actually trying to like wake people up to
[SPEAKER_00]: like the sort of clout Chasing that we've
kind of spoken about already and that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, it's not exactly the greatest thing
What's your thoughts on them doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see it kind of the way I do or do
you just think it's just a troll?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I like clout King what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know Stan the man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know That reference so I'm not
familiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, I follow clout King and I I
do a similar thing I like to like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know bring awareness through me
Whatever you call it meaning You know like
[SPEAKER_04]: What we call in Buddhism, there's a type
of debate called reductio reductio ad
[SPEAKER_04]: absurdum where you pause it the absurdity
of a scenario or a position first so you
[SPEAKER_04]: you basically pause it the result of an
erroneous position in the forefront and In
[SPEAKER_04]: the in a debate standard when you do that,
you basically you take someone's position
[SPEAKER_04]: they have and you Analyze the result of
that position and you put that up in the
[SPEAKER_04]: forefront, but it's actually erroneous and
kind of absurd So they're gonna they're
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna attack it but you do that in a
format to get them To attack themselves,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know to them to negate their own idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a type of Type of a debate
positioning, you know, but the more the
[SPEAKER_04]: reductio ad absurdum is just positing the
erroneous Results of an idea in the
[SPEAKER_04]: forefront of a debate so I think a lot of
these memes are like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like kind of a not to say passive
aggressive but more a Subliminal poke,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and we're gonna they're gonna
pause it this idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's that's stupid basically You know in
a in the resultant format meaning like
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, it's like this isn't this cool Or
this is blah blah blah and everyone's like
[SPEAKER_04]: that's so stupid or that's so this you
know and so what I've experienced thing is
[SPEAKER_04]: that people You know, I'll posit these
kind of ideas as like You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is this is this is dumb It's not
cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not beneficial for self or humanity
and A lot of people will get it and a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of people get turned on by it and be like,
oh, yeah We're down with that,
[SPEAKER_04]: but then there'll be those people They're
like, you're so stupid.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're lame You know just come into the DM
start calling you names.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like wow so so I'm totally into it,
you know, I'm kind of you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I have people even be like Who is this
green body guy?
[SPEAKER_04]: He says he's a Buddhist and he like does
this, you know, it's like It makes me
[SPEAKER_04]: laugh, you know, I was just talking with
my teacher, you know Well, we went to the
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we went to Whole Foods so we can
get some coffee filters You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so and he needed some allergy medicine or
something too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went over there and we're laughing
Um, you know, we're talking about this,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know talking about how people think
once you're a Buddhist You're supposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: be enlightened, you know, he's all even
people think with monks, you know Even
[SPEAKER_04]: we're monk of His Holiness the Dalai Lama
that we're supposed to be enlightened,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know He's all that we're not supposed
to get angry or eat meat or anything like
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all so stupid Because the reality is
we're all human and if we were enlightened
[SPEAKER_04]: we wouldn't be on a spiritual path To
evolve, you know, we wouldn't have chosen
[SPEAKER_04]: a path to try to deal with all our
ignorances and our own You know lame ways
[SPEAKER_04]: of being We wouldn't have to you know,
so Yeah, so it's it's it's it's an
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting dichotomy what's happening
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think with this whole woke mentality
Spirituality, you know, you can go do
[SPEAKER_04]: ayahuasca in any city in the nation,
you know with some wacko want to be shaman
[SPEAKER_04]: or some you know shaman that some other
wacko like Brought here to make money off
[SPEAKER_04]: of and make business off of it's like it's
sad, you know But it's a societal norm
[SPEAKER_04]: right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this kind of um You know these meme
lords that are that are sharing their
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective and trying to shed light on
the The the ignorances of our industry and
[SPEAKER_04]: our scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So That's my perspective of it Yeah,
and one I can certainly understand in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain regards Something which I wanted
to loop back to because you mentioned it a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit earlier was you said you like smoking
strains that are kind of more mentally
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulating Stimulating clarity and
reflection out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the strains which for you
at least achieve that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I mean my favorite strain that I'm
smoking on right now is this purple Hindu
[SPEAKER_04]: Kush that I got from Mr. Bob Hemphill is
his IG handle his genetics company with
[SPEAKER_04]: his wife is crickets and cicada and he's
one of the More popular respected and cool
[SPEAKER_04]: Strain collectors of the last couple
decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's that's actually what I've been
I'm really enjoying right now because it
[SPEAKER_04]: offers this full range of What i'm going
for from, you know stimulating mindset to
[SPEAKER_04]: also High satisfaction kind of og subdued
kind of but it still has this very
[SPEAKER_04]: stimulating aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um So that's what i'm liking on right now,
but other than that, um this sour og from
[SPEAKER_04]: amico seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a um, it's a hell's angels og by
sourdise liby l um that when I crossed the
[SPEAKER_04]: 78 og la afi to Making the tens and kushes
Those are really I really like a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's it brings this really
high-end stimulating aspect, but then it
[SPEAKER_04]: still has this chem og kind of satisfying
You're there vibe, you know the hazy kush
[SPEAKER_04]: was is another one that Induces that but
that'll induce a type of euphoria after a
[SPEAKER_04]: half hour or so for this kind of racy Edgy
onset though, you know, some people love
[SPEAKER_04]: some people don't like it all because it
you know Make it give you that lip sweat
[SPEAKER_04]: give you that kind of You know hyper
anxiety to some degrees if that's how your
[SPEAKER_04]: chemistry is So those are those are those
are the strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've really been liking a lot For those
for those that kind of avenue personally
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not really a sativa or an indica I'm
really focused mainly on hybrids for what
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm what i'm liking personally So yeah
great answer and some good starting points
[SPEAKER_00]: for people to go look into if they're into
that sort of thing I know that I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally love Exactly what you're
talking about, you know those mentally
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulating sativas and for what it's
worth The one i've always really enjoyed
[SPEAKER_00]: which Admittedly haven't been able to have
that much access to was genius from
[SPEAKER_00]: brother's grim That was just a phenomenal
strain for sort of that mental clarity
[SPEAKER_00]: just to loop back to a point you mentioned
just before the initial one I loop back to
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned that um, there's some
current sort of debate around or
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion at least around Whether the
origin place of cannabis is sort of maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: around the himalayan region and it got me
wondering Do you or have you ever been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to smoke much sort of nepalese or
maybe even like the?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese strains we see and Either way,
do you want to work with those strands
[SPEAKER_00]: going forward or are they a bit too sort
of land racy?
[SPEAKER_04]: um, I have smoked some of them and They're
not necessarily to land racy more I mean
[SPEAKER_04]: and I do have a few things from china
right now and I have quite a few things
[SPEAKER_04]: from the Nepalese himalayan region and
then also laos the
[SPEAKER_04]: Um bode gave me some lao asian land race
years back and I popped a bunch of those
[SPEAKER_04]: and Those were very similar to hazy kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was really shocked, you know I busted
these out and I was like, whoa,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is weird smells just like hazy kush
This is true man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It grows just like a two.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is so weird, you know so of course I
crossed that the hazy into that too,
[SPEAKER_04]: but so That was um one land race from asia
that I really did like And I have some
[SPEAKER_04]: things up from northern india Closer to
you know More on the western side of the
[SPEAKER_04]: himalaya, obviously, but I don't have I
haven't really sourced a lot from the
[SPEAKER_04]: tibetan plateau or from Even siberian
plateau.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have some stuff from up in siberia But
it's it's you know, some different auto
[SPEAKER_04]: flower stuff some some other things that
i'm trying to look through chimerians
[SPEAKER_04]: chimerian stuff It's i'm just unfamiliar
um with the history on some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: things So I don't I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started some of it, but it was Wasn't
what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So um, I didn't go into work with any of
it too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I Would um, I would like to see a
little more information though on You know
[SPEAKER_04]: the history of The gene pool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know that like what there's what
they're saying from the tibetan plateau I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't even actually know what strain that
is, but they're saying the earliest
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis origins There it's pointing to
there now if you research it's pretty easy
[SPEAKER_04]: to find google searches of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But um So I thought that was quite
interesting, you know Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's kind of always been thought it
was sort of around that area near the
[SPEAKER_00]: afghan Sort of border with the himalayas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So certainly seems like there could be
some credibility in that one Just to take
[SPEAKER_00]: us back to the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We normally ask guests when we start the
episode What are you smoking on today or
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you plan on smoking on later
today?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you haven't already That purple hindu
kush that I was mentioning.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty much my right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been my go-to All day all night kind
of thing So that's kind of yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been smoking it all day and all night
if I want to mix it up a little bit I'll
[SPEAKER_04]: grind up some, you know Bubble hash in
with it and then take bong into that
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even though I have access and I
have you know 30 30 flowers to choose from
[SPEAKER_04]: I still just put one or two in my jar And
I give away all the rest and I smoke those
[SPEAKER_00]: two strains three strains usually I mean I
can certainly vouch that many of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars in bob hamphill's library are
just simply lovely What is it about this
[SPEAKER_00]: purple hindu kush that you're a fan of
because we've heard a lot of people go to
[SPEAKER_00]: Great lengths to try to differentiate this
particular cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently it's quite old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the normal purple kush that goes
around It's definitely not yaga,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of sometimes confused as
this purple kush in Oregon What's your
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it totally different to others or just
a sort of improved version of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: purple kush as we see?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's kind of interesting because you
know, the first purple kush I got was in
[SPEAKER_04]: 90 92 in in Ridgecrest, you know There
were some guys bringing some purple kush
[SPEAKER_04]: down and they're from Oregon and I was
buying a lot of it and obviously selling
[SPEAKER_04]: my three-quarters and getting a quarter
for free, you know, so And then just like
[SPEAKER_04]: stacking up as many quarters as I could so
we can all you know Me and the homies can
[SPEAKER_04]: all just puff and rage this purple kush,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So from then to now I've had quite a few
different iterations of it and this is by
[SPEAKER_04]: far You know the best makes um,
I mean in my own opinion it makes the high
[SPEAKER_04]: from Jager kind of subpar It's very
interesting this this train because it has
[SPEAKER_04]: like a orangey tangy turp in it also,
which is you know, kind of reminds me of
[SPEAKER_04]: tangy land a little bit, but It's just
more funky more kind of og fuel II more
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of even like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just has all these exotic notes that
are just on another level and The high is
[SPEAKER_04]: just untouchable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't you know, I haven't found
something I enjoyed more to this Point yet
[SPEAKER_04]: right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's it's one of my favorites and
everyone that I've smoked out with it is
[SPEAKER_04]: in the same boat They're just like whoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know So it's it's something special.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and and then like every time I keep
giving them It's Robinville props on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's always like She's a special one She's
a special one.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a special one.
[SPEAKER_06]: She said that a bunch of times now.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's a special one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's and it's like that, you know,
um, so That's kind of where I'm at with
[SPEAKER_00]: that and right now Yeah, awesome and a
good little rundown in the comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your first ever experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a long time ago I'm 46 now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was six years old and I was in
Nebraska six five or six years old and me
[SPEAKER_04]: and my neighbor friend You know that we he
lived across the alley from me in the back
[SPEAKER_04]: and so the alleyway was our kind of like
play zone and we were you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know back then in the 80s it and you
didn't really matter, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you didn't have to have someone watching
you You know, you walked home from school.
[SPEAKER_04]: You walked to the babysitter.
[SPEAKER_04]: You played all day until tonight,
you know that kind of vibe, you know You
[SPEAKER_04]: know, nobody kidnapping kids is like they
are now, you know, but well, I wasn't no
[SPEAKER_04]: No, probably is happening then too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway that being said We're we me and
my friend were playing we see these plants
[SPEAKER_04]: in the sky's backyard and they were just
like Calling us, you know, I just remember
[SPEAKER_04]: them like in the breeze moving like I'm
was like I wanted him You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so me and my friend jumped this guy's
fence And ripped these plants out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: ground and took them back to my house,
you know And then I took them to the house
[SPEAKER_04]: and I had them, you know had one of those
little blue swimming pools That's in
[SPEAKER_04]: Lincoln, Nebraska You know one of those
and I a little just little plastic pools
[SPEAKER_04]: that I mix oil in or whatever,
you know a little kiddie pool So we put
[SPEAKER_04]: all those plants in there and then filled
it with water and then we're just like
[SPEAKER_04]: tromping around like kind of like a wine
So that was my first experience with
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, you know My first experience
ingesting it I think I was I was in Eugene
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was ten years old and Two different
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember one kid middle schooler kids
like hey come here try this, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I tried a little hit of what he had
been a little pipe and and Nothing really
[SPEAKER_04]: happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the next time was right around
that time near this place called whiz tech
[SPEAKER_04]: or Cuthbert Cuthbert amphitheater and
Eugene near the uvo stadium There's
[SPEAKER_04]: there's like some canoe shoots and there's
this kid there, you know, you know a few
[SPEAKER_04]: years older than me, too He's like,
hey come here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to try this?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, yeah walked over.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: He busted out this little foil had some
hash in it with some gold like look like
[SPEAKER_04]: Asian lettering on it like stamp like Thai
probably and he rolled up a little ball
[SPEAKER_04]: popped in this Pipe and me and him smoked
this little bowl and I just went about my
[SPEAKER_04]: way, you know I don't know if I even felt
it then either, you know So those are my
[SPEAKER_04]: like around that same time I've another
friend of mine and Eugene's dad was
[SPEAKER_04]: growing a big field of weed in his
backyard hemp or something and we ripped a
[SPEAKER_04]: bunch of those plants out of the ground
and dried them on my roof and smoked it
[SPEAKER_04]: when We know I've found a found a some
bamboo down the way So I cut a you know
[SPEAKER_04]: segment of bamboo made my own little pipe
this whole thing You know, none of this is
[SPEAKER_04]: that you know, I'm just you know free free
flowing, you know I haven't learned This
[SPEAKER_04]: anywhere my parents, you know,
my dad was a military all this but so
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe it was like past life stuff,
you know, so So a lot of it came very
[SPEAKER_04]: natural, you know, so what's funny when in
the My friend's dad that had the field in
[SPEAKER_04]: Eugene and we just took the plants out the
ripped him right out fresh But he had the
[SPEAKER_04]: shed that he was drying all the stuff in
and we looked in there and I remember
[SPEAKER_04]: looking as all brown and weird looking
sort of like Alice take this fresh green
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff, you know, and so those are my those
are my first experiences with cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: then you know, it was until I was in High
school really before I started I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: experimenting, you know There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean you you brought up a great
little segue there in that I had read
[SPEAKER_00]: online that you grew up as sort of a
military child and Then as a teenager,
[SPEAKER_00]: you kind of started experimenting with
psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did all of that play into being a
military child?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only imagine it was kind of a bit
frowned on how did you get around that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of obstacle of the family?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, um, you know like so basically You
know, I wanted to was crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to be a youth pastor when I was
younger, you know, so I was like You know
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of I was going to Christian schools
training to do that and then had some
[SPEAKER_04]: really cool experiences happen in the
church I was going to didn't really um,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they didn't vibe with my
experience very well, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so whatever That being said my dad was
like very strict military.
[SPEAKER_04]: My mom's Asian So, you know, we had quite
a strict household.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when I was 18, I was Kind of allowed
to do what I wanted so You know started
[SPEAKER_04]: experimenting with everything but even if
at that time, you know We're experimenting
[SPEAKER_04]: with everything because we're out in
Ridgecrest.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's out in the Mojave Desert You know,
all the kids are boiling pods of gypsum
[SPEAKER_04]: weed, you know, like You know eatin eatin
like gypsum, you know loco weed like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, deterra, you know moonflower You
know the one the local weed that grows out
[SPEAKER_04]: in the desert.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're there They're all poisoning
themselves with this these like gypsum
[SPEAKER_04]: weed pods, you know So they're all having
those stomachs pumped having these like
[SPEAKER_04]: three days Psychedelic experiences,
you know, or you know, and the the gypsum
[SPEAKER_04]: weed experience isn't a fun psychedelic
experience It's like one where you go
[SPEAKER_04]: blind and you like to have all these crazy
scary scary trips, you know That being
[SPEAKER_04]: said so we're you know, we're kind of a
weird little town So, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we do things like drink Robitussin,
you know, I'd drink like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone drink one bottle I drink too,
you know, we'd take boxes of marazine,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is like this motion sickness pill
You eat the whole box you get psychedelic,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you actually have true
hallucinations, you know So this is like
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of what I grew up around so we're
just continually experimenting with
[SPEAKER_04]: everything then mushrooms and LSD then all
that stuff and You know just being a just
[SPEAKER_04]: being like that kind of kid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think from the time I was 18 to 23 I
wasn't I didn't have much agenda.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still wanting to you know at that point
I was wanting to go into the Special
[SPEAKER_04]: Forces Wanted to go on the Green Berets
and try to go Delta and try to be like a
[SPEAKER_04]: mercenary killer You know, that was kind
of my mindset but I was out in Georgia and
[SPEAKER_04]: You know ended up getting a 30 strip Of L
but I thought it was a 10 strip because it
[SPEAKER_04]: was given to me as a 10 strip so I cut it
in 10 rectangles instead of 30 pieces and
[SPEAKER_04]: I ate a few of those and You know had
quite the experience obviously and when I
[SPEAKER_04]: was coming down I was watching this
cartoon called spawn by Tim McFarlane and
[SPEAKER_04]: You know kind of saw my future if I was
gonna go into the Green Berets and what
[SPEAKER_04]: was you know I just it was a very trippy
it was very trippy to see that tripped out
[SPEAKER_04]: and then so that kind of changed my
Changed my trajectory and That's when I
[SPEAKER_04]: moved to Eugene and you know, just
bartending started growing herb you know
[SPEAKER_04]: and stopped a bartending only growing herb
and that's kind of the all that luckily I
[SPEAKER_04]: was in contact with quite a few good
elders of Eugene community that Saw
[SPEAKER_04]: something in me and started sharing
literature and information with me that
[SPEAKER_04]: you know set me on a different path
basically kind of opened my eyes to a
[SPEAKER_04]: different Different type of warrior ship I
guess, you know instead of being like a
[SPEAKER_04]: warrior that kills people a warrior that
like is Set out and steadfast for helping
[SPEAKER_04]: others, you know, so just different
different and even then I wanted to be a
[SPEAKER_04]: the best killer on earth to help people,
you know, so The intention was right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just the everything else wasn't you
know, so Yeah, certainly and so I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: growing up with those elders influence on
you it must have been a bit of a leg up to
[SPEAKER_00]: have To not go through exactly all the
trials and tribulations people do when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're kind of learning the ropes
themselves what were some of the strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were growing or that you were
gifted at the time and what sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: Setup were you using was it like just
basic lights indoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us a bit of a rundown on how you
first started growing Well, how I first
[SPEAKER_04]: started growing right when I moved to
Eugene in this was in 97 97 I think 90 and
[SPEAKER_04]: a 97 I instantly started growing peppers
habanero scotch scotch ball I had all
[SPEAKER_04]: these different dad to all these different
spicy peppers because I had allergies
[SPEAKER_04]: really bad in the Willamette Valley area
and I was using these peppers I was eating
[SPEAKER_04]: them just to like deal with my allergies
and Then I put a couple seeds and a spider
[SPEAKER_04]: plant in my bedroom and they sprouted and
I was like, oh man I'm gonna grow these
[SPEAKER_04]: things, you know So then I made this
little makeshift closet set up with like
[SPEAKER_04]: styrofoam walls and all that a little
light that you know hundred feet 250 watt
[SPEAKER_04]: or 250 watt light that's like a you know,
parking lot light You know that you use
[SPEAKER_04]: for like it was off of a dentist dentist
office parking parking parking lot light
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I use that and then I had
another little Light that I was using,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know And so and then I built a little
makeshift closet box after this,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know my first run actually with these
You know seeds out of the spider plant and
[SPEAKER_04]: I grew it all herm.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had seeds It was garbage,
you know, like straight garbage,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, then I was like, I'm gonna do
it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I built a little Box put this light and
then put a 400 wide wad in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had the 400 plus a 250 and built a
little box in my closet and then I had the
[SPEAKER_04]: strains that I had there obviously Eugene
was kind of a You know the hub for good
[SPEAKER_04]: weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I first started growing with a strain
called Trinity Another strain called Big
[SPEAKER_04]: Sur Holy and then blueberry and blueberry
trend and another strain called IDK Which
[SPEAKER_04]: stood for I don't know but it was you
know, Eugene chronic strain so obviously
[SPEAKER_04]: Trinity has the And the it's like legend
strain from Eugene for like, you know
[SPEAKER_04]: forever still And then the other strains
are pretty apparent But yeah, so that's
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of how it started and then the second
grow after that little closet I made my
[SPEAKER_04]: whole closet to grow and just had to trap
door and then you know went from the 650
[SPEAKER_04]: watts to a thousand watt and then we went
to two thousand watt and four thousand
[SPEAKER_04]: watt and eight thousand one, you know,
and then it's just like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you just keep leapfrogging up doubling up
That's kind of how it started Yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic Trinity is an interesting one
because it's kind of I feel like it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those strains where it's like
everyone has super fun memories of it but
[SPEAKER_00]: no one really kept it on lockdown and it
brings up this idea of like Why do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think it is there are these strains which
people revere so much?
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time seemingly no one was
able to really hang on to a cut or if
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a cut around now there's Some
people who are a bit like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really sure if it's the real one
still How do you think we got to this
[SPEAKER_00]: point?
[SPEAKER_04]: I?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was the last one in Eugene that I knew
that I had the cut and I let it go because
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was lame After a certain
point, you know, it was having these
[SPEAKER_04]: little seed pods in it, you know And it
was just having some Degradation I think
[SPEAKER_04]: but that could have just been my ignorance
at the time and me not knowing How to deal
[SPEAKER_04]: with the plant in the same way so I let it
go because I thought it was it was boring
[SPEAKER_04]: to me after you know that many years,
you know and The new the new train that's
[SPEAKER_04]: around definitely isn't that you know,
the future trend definitely wasn't that
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got a bunch of Trinity strains
since then that were almost identical,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they weren't that so You know a lot of
these strains it's like usually You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's a person that's holding a lot of
these once that person decides to let it
[SPEAKER_04]: go a lot of times it goes away because You
know people aren't that good at holding on
[SPEAKER_04]: to genetics People aren't that committed
at holding on to a hundred mothers,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we're just gonna have a space
just to keep their staple of genetics,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that's just Especially now it's
kind of rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I wish I still had that first
trim, but You know at a certain point You
[SPEAKER_04]: get over it and it's not worth keeping
anymore Yeah, that's kind of how it is for
[SPEAKER_04]: me, you know like the golden pineapple It
was it was a great one for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smoked it a lot now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even want to smoke it You know,
it's not something that I put in my jar,
[SPEAKER_04]: even though it's Everyone loves it every
you know, new smoker loves it every you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, just but It's just not my not in a
not my cup of tea anymore Yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: Understandably after having enjoyed
something for a long period of time you
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of look for the sort of new and
better things I love that you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: the golden pineapple Because it's I'm one
of those people you just referenced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not burnt out on it It's um,
it's some lovely stuff Is this what you
[SPEAKER_00]: would consider one of the sort of high
quality genetics, which has been around
[SPEAKER_00]: Eugene for a while I remember I read
something I think it might have been
[SPEAKER_00]: online it kind of said you move back to
Eugene and Found that there was all these
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of high quality genetics and clones
that were held by the community around
[SPEAKER_00]: there Was this one of them and what was
some of the other ones that you really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyed from that?
[SPEAKER_04]: scene Well, I mean like I was saying You
know, I held a lot of these things and and
[SPEAKER_04]: I was the one that actually passed the
golden pineapple around Eugene I got it
[SPEAKER_04]: from a friend There's this person that
brought the brought the golden pineapple
[SPEAKER_04]: to Eugene on Instagram his Handle is shad
glass and he's the one that actually
[SPEAKER_04]: brought that cut to Eugene and brought it
out of Hood River So yeah, that was one of
[SPEAKER_04]: them for sure, but I you know when I got
that You know At that time we had a huge
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of genetics in the town,
you know So like I had you know when you
[SPEAKER_04]: it's very interesting when you have
certain strains And you hold certain
[SPEAKER_04]: strains and everyone knows you to hold
them without giving them out You can get
[SPEAKER_04]: lots of strains and people will give you
lots of strains I mean even look at the I
[SPEAKER_04]: had a strain called the Eugene lemon
diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought it down to Santa Cruz next
thing, you know lemon tree pops out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine that, you know you bring this
strain that's the Eugene lemon diesel to
[SPEAKER_04]: town and Next thing you know all these
strains start popping out of it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and then I found out from my You
know Santa Cruz cannabis companies all
[SPEAKER_04]: dude You're the one that brought that that
to Santa Cruz because that's where the
[SPEAKER_04]: Lemontree came out of I said, oh I know
and you know but a lot of people don't
[SPEAKER_04]: want to say that you know because Doesn't
sound good for them anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean that I started selling the lemon
diesel out of a dispensary called creme de
[SPEAKER_04]: canna out of Santa Cruz and I brought the
golden pineapple down there too and the
[SPEAKER_04]: silver surfer and We started selling them
out of their dispensary next thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, all these brands start popping
up, you know, so it's funny, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal very normal Yeah, it's interesting
to hear that I I just want to quickly ask
[SPEAKER_00]: we've often heard that the lemon tree is
some sort of lemon skunk hybrid Do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's maybe just a relabeled lemon
diesel that came from you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think there's maybe some sort of
pollination and it was like a seed from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Yeah, I don't honestly I don't really
know, you know, cuz anytime I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: around those guys They're super weird to
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just assume person truth to
something, you know So I don't I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: really know you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't Say, but I do know that the lemon
tree definitely isn't the lemon diesel
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's not as good It's not even
close to as good but and it grows
[SPEAKER_04]: different to Grows a little faster a
little bushier, you know that the true
[SPEAKER_04]: lemon diesel was was straight lemon pledge
lemon rind and I mean it I couldn't I
[SPEAKER_04]: never smelled a strain more lemony than
that But the way it grew was this bare
[SPEAKER_04]: Slow stout kind of Afghani style,
but like it had very tight, you know kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of like the master Kush but a little you
know, it's just very interesting but it
[SPEAKER_04]: grew more missile II and But very tight
very slow growing very tight to the stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay, so I don't really know really
when um, he told me that I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: ah, that makes a lot of sense,
you know Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one day we'll find out the answer
Another sort of genetic that I was hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be able to give me a bit of a
rundown is I've seen you work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Best shit ever and the sour best shit ever
This is these are sort of old-school cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: where the origins are a bit cloudy You
know You've got some people in the scene
[SPEAKER_00]: who kind of try to claim ownership over
them and other people just say look,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not really And I think we know who
we're talking about Yeah, I think there's
[SPEAKER_04]: only one person claiming ownership of the
sour best shit ever and he's a complete
[SPEAKER_04]: kook, you know, so Other than that because
you can tell because this guy will steal
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know, he would he would steal
our photos You know, and he would use them
[SPEAKER_04]: on Neptune Seed Bank, you know as his own
photos trying to sell the sour best shit
[SPEAKER_04]: ever but it was tens of Kush number two,
you know, and so like Anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if someone's willing to steal and use
someone else's photos as their own I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: sure they did that with that strain to you
know what I'm saying and for my for my
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding with you know With that
person where that who I got the cut from
[SPEAKER_04]: and how they you know, there's a lot of
there's a lot of a Lot of a lot of a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of sinister stuff around that kind of
reality Yeah, definitely the thing about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, which hopefully I'd like to get some
perspective from you on is What do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think of the genetics within it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard some people say that it's a
whole range of different things We've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard more recently people express.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably just some sort of OGS one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you sit on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what I've been saying
honestly You know the person that uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Said it's a lemon tie by this
that and the other well when I tested it
[SPEAKER_04]: with phylos some years back, you know
There it wasn't related to any of those
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics and they said it was a identical
clone of og Kush It's og Kush clones what
[SPEAKER_04]: they said but they also said that was fire
og ghost og og Kush all that so We just we
[SPEAKER_04]: just say it's an s1 because you know I
don't think phylos could see if it was an
[SPEAKER_04]: s1 or not if they're saying it's an
identical clone and I talked to you know
[SPEAKER_04]: people about this and they've agreed so
You know, I don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like it seems like og Kush to me
Seems like an s1 of og That's just kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: how it seems like to me Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's definitely a gathering
pool of weight to sort of support that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of similarly I've seen that you work
with mail that you call the 78 la afi og
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is interesting Because it popped
that name sort of pops up in other places
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's the DNA release of LA con
which sort of Alludes to a similar sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: parent, but it might be different What's
this male and what does it bring to the
[SPEAKER_00]: table for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it the similar sort of one that we
saw with the Bombay Kush or it's just a
[SPEAKER_04]: similar sort of name I'm not really sure
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got the pollen from My friend he goes by
Andrew puffin on Instagram and he got the
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds from Leo from official Ado and they
were you know what they were labeled.
[SPEAKER_04]: So There's a big story and uh,
you know the history of how those seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: were acquired and how You know what
happened and all that which I don't really
[SPEAKER_04]: want to get into it's none of my business
And I don't really know what's true or
[SPEAKER_04]: not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't even want to start to project,
you know So that's kind of what's up with
[SPEAKER_04]: that the genetic pool of it I don't really
know, you know, like you could we can say
[SPEAKER_04]: it's one thing and say it's another but
anyone that's talking about it I just it's
[SPEAKER_04]: hard for me to believe Because nobody
really knows and when I do genetic tests
[SPEAKER_04]: on it, it doesn't hit the marks that
they're saying it is so You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's kind of where I've been out with it
I do like the genetic profile of what it's
[SPEAKER_04]: offered That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I'm continually I'm working
with it and that's why I got you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: my buddy got he basically did a seed
increase on it and So we got I got more of
[SPEAKER_00]: that from him Yeah, nice and so How does
this play into or maybe more better put?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us a bit of a rundown on the
backstory of the Tenzin Kush and how the
[SPEAKER_00]: genesis of that sort of came about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so basically So basically The Souro
G from Amiko is I really liked a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when I got that pollen I got that
pollen From someone from Drew and I it was
[SPEAKER_04]: handed to me in a little pill bottle,
you know, like a little just a pill You
[SPEAKER_04]: know, there's a little bit like if you
were to you know as a double odd pill and
[SPEAKER_04]: I had maybe like a half of a pea Half of a
pea size worth of pollen in there So I
[SPEAKER_04]: basically put that by the Golden Pineapple
and the Souro G and that's our best shit
[SPEAKER_04]: ever and then Just pop some seeds out of
it and then every one out of the Souro G
[SPEAKER_04]: cross was good every single one and so
that's why I kind of grabbed an affinity
[SPEAKER_04]: towards it and Started working with it is
just because I like the high so much and
[SPEAKER_04]: there's CBD potential in it But other than
that, you know, that was that was the
[SPEAKER_04]: reason I started working with it to be
honest and then The reason I had started
[SPEAKER_04]: running with it is because what was being
produced on the female end was so So
[SPEAKER_04]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just couldn't You know, I just wanted to
keep going with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Started working with some males finding
some good males throwing this by some
[SPEAKER_04]: things and Getting some good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty happy Nice and I've
noticed online that there's a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenotypes you like I think I
remember seeing the number two and the
[SPEAKER_00]: number four How would they differ in terms
of if people were gonna get one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses and they're wondering,
you know What's this one bringing to the
[SPEAKER_00]: table versus the other?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you kind of give them the
comparison?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the the Tenzin Kush number two is
more like a souped up sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it has a lot of these camp Notes
a lot of a lot of diesel II fuel notes,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's gonna be more Stimulating even
more than this hour even The richness of
[SPEAKER_04]: it and the complexity the terpene profile
is a lot more complex, you know a lot more
[SPEAKER_04]: lime notes a lot more I mean almost smells
like super glue or kind of you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: those kind of those kind of those kind of
those kind of Notes to it, but the Tenzin
[SPEAKER_04]: four has this sandalwood incense Kush
perfume kind of and and it's they look
[SPEAKER_04]: totally different the Tenzin Kush number
fours purple silver very beautiful and the
[SPEAKER_04]: Tenzin two is very lime green very like
soury looking, you know So that's that's
[SPEAKER_04]: that's that's the difference of them On
that context of the high on on the other
[SPEAKER_04]: hand is quite different the the high on
the Tenzin four is going to be more OG
[SPEAKER_04]: more, you know, Kush Kush LA Kush cake
kind of vibe high versus the high on the
[SPEAKER_04]: Tenzin Two it's going to be more
stimulating more, you know chem diesel
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of you know, maybe give someone
anxiety kind of high whoo Interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting on the other end of the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the more sort of Sativa
offerings from you being like the hazy
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush and the mystery Kush which is kind of
built off that What was the backstory on
[SPEAKER_00]: those ones and was it intentional that you
wanted to have these two sort of opposite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of flagship strains or it just kind
of came about that way Yeah, no,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's um, it just came about that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So basically the golden pineapple I
crossed the OG Kush sage from THC Into the
[SPEAKER_04]: this strain called the dawn or kid next
door is a classic Eugene strain,
[SPEAKER_04]: which was a Train wreck by purple aphi.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I crossed the OG Kush sage by that Grab
some mails out of that put it to the
[SPEAKER_04]: golden made the hazy Kush And pretty much
every single feno that came out of that
[SPEAKER_04]: cross was epic and so then I back crossed
it And then we popped this seed and we
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hence.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called the mystery But then it was
a daughter of the hazy You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so the mystery Kush was just or mystery
Hayes was just that it was just basically
[SPEAKER_04]: the daughter of the hazy Kush And that's
and that's what's up with that So just a
[SPEAKER_04]: back cross of hazy basically that we
didn't know in the beginning and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: figured it out through testing and
everything Yeah, sure So I mean talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about the back cross What sort of a male
do you want to pick when you're looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a back cross if you make an f1 hybrid
with hazy Kush and you think Alright,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use this a male from this back cross
it to the hazy Kush and we'll get our bx1
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you look for like the most hazy Kush
leaning male so to speak or how do you go
[SPEAKER_00]: about that process of creating that line
bred strain?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well a lot of times when I'm doing um,
you know, so like when I did the the tens
[SPEAKER_04]: and cross I use four males and I pick my
four best males and I use those four
[SPEAKER_04]: because I wanted to get a larger genetic
swath swath of the gene pool I was crazy
[SPEAKER_04]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It felt like I didn't get that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt like I got more You know of the
same all the progeny that I've popped
[SPEAKER_04]: they're all very similar, you know So I
always I think that's quite interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: that when I do these kind of multi-male
pollinations How similar all the strains
[SPEAKER_04]: that come out of it?
[SPEAKER_04]: How all the the the phenos that come out
of it are I thought they'd be a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: different But they're actually usually
more close to the line You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so that's kind of how I do it personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I pick my best males and I give more
options I don't really like to pick just
[SPEAKER_04]: one male.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just not how I do it personally You
know I have but that's just not generally
[SPEAKER_00]: how I do it Okay, and do you like to keep
males and when you re-release seeds you're
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of remaking it in the same way or do
you like to have like a pool of seeds pop
[SPEAKER_00]: some new ones pick a new male and sort of
like each Offering its own sort of unique
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just depends on what I'm going for
honestly You know right now like I I did a
[SPEAKER_04]: fem line I reversed the hazy and I made
some stuff with that So I'm testing that
[SPEAKER_04]: right now is one of my first reversal
lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm seeing if they're all good before I
release any Other than that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: really I'm just trying to see and find
what I am in tune with most, you know
[SPEAKER_04]: right now I'm Bodhi gave me a Larry og by
purple unicorn f3 that I'm gonna try to
[SPEAKER_04]: make some purple ogs with So I have that I
have an indigo child male that's from Mass
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinals that I might throw into some
things and then I have some other stuff at
[SPEAKER_04]: home that I'm gonna start sourcing some
things to find some males with personally,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Yeah, wow, it looks like you've
got some interesting options on the
[SPEAKER_00]: horizon Give me a little bit of a rundown
about how you first came to Befriend with
[SPEAKER_00]: Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find everyone's always really interested
in the origins of Bodhi friendships And I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess what's kind of interesting is,
you know with the very similar names
[SPEAKER_00]: people might have mistakenly thought There
was some tension there or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but I get the impression.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the opposite Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah I don't remember actually when I met
Bodhi Actually 2000 When we personally met
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was 2000 what is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: 2021 2014 maybe 13 the Emerald Cup Yeah,
no, and and and I the first I'd heard
[SPEAKER_04]: about Bodhi, which is very funny is I Was
in Santa Cruz and I was doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: work there and I was selling herb to this
spot Santa Cruz Mountain Naturals in
[SPEAKER_04]: Aptos, you know And and I went in there
and you guys like hey, do you know Bodhi
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, are you fucking kidding?
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone's like ripping off my fucking
name, but really I was are you kidding?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all no man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Bodhi seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a fucking G I was like really?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, okay cool, you know, and I just
like, you know, I didn't really do much
[SPEAKER_04]: research at that time I was like,
oh, that's interesting, you know Um,
[SPEAKER_04]: but then I did a little more research and
saw like cuz I was never in the forums
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just wasn't a part of my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I didn't know any of that I
didn't know that world even existed to be
[SPEAKER_04]: honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So When I found out Well, as funny as I
find out from all these old heads,
[SPEAKER_04]: they tell me about the forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know my friend Mike he's Kagu or
coastal seeds and another friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Katsu seeds is I Bob,
you know, he's so they're telling me all
[SPEAKER_04]: this stuff about the forums and I'm like,
oh sick I didn't really know that that was
[SPEAKER_04]: going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was like it was interesting So then
when I was talking to Steve a lot or
[SPEAKER_04]: Bodhi, sorry About all this and he's
telling me everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just getting familiar with it all I
was like it was very interesting,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, cuz it's just something was out
of my league You know without my realm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know that cuz I was in Eugene So
I didn't have to go get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have to go seek it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was there I was there, you know,
it was like the Mecca of heady herbs You
[SPEAKER_04]: know, so I didn't there wasn't you know,
it just wasn't a part of our wheelhouse
[SPEAKER_04]: But even my friend Katsu sees he's telling
me he's all dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all back in the day, bro I would send
clones to people all over the nation
[SPEAKER_04]: through forums.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like what he's all yeah,
bro Like if you live in Kansas City,
[SPEAKER_04]: you want a chem dog?
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubba kush OG kush.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will send you all the cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like what fucking legend,
you know But that's what I was doing in
[SPEAKER_04]: Eugene kind of I was offering people all
lots of cuts, you know, but that being
[SPEAKER_04]: said so You know, I mean me and me and
Bodhi befriended and just we found a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of similarities just in vibe You know,
we was funny as we actually most of the
[SPEAKER_04]: time when we hang out we've hung out over
these years We don't talk about herb we
[SPEAKER_04]: talk about travels spiritual practice
different, you know philosophic studies
[SPEAKER_04]: different things, you know, it's like very
very little little little about weed,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know and What's so crazy is that one
of the last times I was hanging out With
[SPEAKER_04]: him.
[SPEAKER_04]: We started talking and you know,
we were talking about Peru and you know
[SPEAKER_04]: first time I went down there and blah blah
blah, you know, I was telling was like I
[SPEAKER_04]: went down to the first Amazonian shamanic
conference in Akitos, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: he's all what so good Alma I was there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said what he's all yeah, I was there I
was like that's so funny cuz that's where
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had Come up with my name,
you know He's all yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't have the money to go into the the
conference So I went down to call but I
[SPEAKER_04]: think he said or went on a different
journey, you know, I said that's cool
[SPEAKER_04]: crazy, man, because that's where I come in
contact with my first teacher where I
[SPEAKER_04]: actually spawned the name green Bodhi
because you know, he was Basically a crazy
[SPEAKER_04]: wisdom, you know kind of like the real Don
Juan, you know, he's last ink and royal
[SPEAKER_04]: descendant of the royal family basically
left everything in Peru to go to India
[SPEAKER_04]: took his two sons to India Learned
Buddhist Dharma there for three years
[SPEAKER_04]: under the Karmakaji lineage come back to
Peru, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I met him there and so he was basically
teaching, you know the path of wisdom and
[SPEAKER_04]: enlightenment Through the through the
wisdom plants and the power plants in
[SPEAKER_04]: association with quantum physics and
Buddhist Dharma, you know So I was like,
[SPEAKER_04]: ah, you know, like green Bodhi meaning the
enlightenment that that derived from the
[SPEAKER_04]: wisdom plants the green, you know So
that's the where the name spawned from
[SPEAKER_04]: that moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like very interesting all these
very interesting parallels, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so like You know, we're talking some
years few years for three or four years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago three years back and I was like we
should do a we should do a collab to show
[SPEAKER_02]: that like they were different,
you know, and that but they were like
[SPEAKER_02]: Homies and shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all we should do that, you know,
and I was like I always should donate all
[SPEAKER_04]: the money to his holiness Library Museum
project, you know, and he's all that
[SPEAKER_04]: sounds awesome So yeah, he gave me a for
ancient OG males that he had that he had a
[SPEAKER_04]: Fino hundred or someone might have Fino
hunted for him I can't remember those are
[SPEAKER_04]: the best ones he picked though and he gave
me those and that's what we did that
[SPEAKER_04]: project with you know, so Yeah,
no, it's it's it's very interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: because the you know the admiration,
you know I have for him and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we share it's very It's very cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I have a lot of respect for him
and a lot of respect for what he's done
[SPEAKER_04]: his travels and really just more who he is
as a person, you know, they had nothing to
[SPEAKER_04]: do with weed, you know, just You know,
he's just such a fucking cool guy that you
[SPEAKER_04]: know, he's very likable, you know,
very sweet guy, you know So then when you
[SPEAKER_04]: start to research like or even like,
you know, if you just research one of his
[SPEAKER_04]: trips You know or one of his travels
you're like, whoa, it's like pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: impressive, you know So yeah, you know
it's kind of the kind of the brief rundown
[SPEAKER_00]: of it to be honest, so No brilliant
backstory and I can I can certainly attest
[SPEAKER_00]: he's a very cool cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's definitely one-of-a-kind Interesting
you brought up the ancient OG because I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to ask you about that What sort of
attributes do you think that male brings
[SPEAKER_00]: to certain?
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids and I've always had this suspicion
that like the ancient OG was such a crowd
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite because of that mythical Iranian
in it Have you ever seen that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing come through in the crosses?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I mean for me personally that
that's the reason I like it, you know the
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not sure if it's from the Iranian.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like that's bringing all these
qualities, but You know from shape You
[SPEAKER_04]: know bud shape to trichome size to You
know these kind of Very interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: because you know The snow lotus has such a
you know a prominent smell that this
[SPEAKER_04]: ancient OG doesn't bring that to such a
degree, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So and that's what it is right snow lotus
ain't a rainy land race or something like
[SPEAKER_04]: that And then you know, so that snow
lotus, you know, usually is pretty strong
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes in pretty heavy and it doesn't
with this one It's more of the rainy and
[SPEAKER_04]: that I'm assuming is coming in because
it's it's something different than the
[SPEAKER_04]: snow lotus, you know, so it's like You
know the first first nug I have I enjoyed
[SPEAKER_04]: it so much that I was just like I was not
kind of on a hunt for it after that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know In mother load gardens did a seed
or increase of it, you know So I was gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: link up with him and get some seeds from
him and try to do it Project that and then
[SPEAKER_04]: I just hit up, you know Bodhi and he's all
no man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a bunch of mails Let's do it with
these.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's do this then so yeah,
it's very it's it's it's a cool it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: cool it's kind of like honestly what it
reminds me of it reminds you of land race
[SPEAKER_04]: turps with a New Age style of structure,
you know Yeah, wow interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that some other strains you were
offering were Utilizing the Razz which I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe is a cut of go go G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, so I have the pine saw on the goji
Razz that Bodhi gave me some years back
[SPEAKER_04]: and That pine saw I really like a lot the
goji Razz.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it's just a little not my
headspace, you know, it brings me it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: little more indigo head and That's um,
that's a little heavy for me personally
[SPEAKER_04]: just it's a little tiresome for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure So I noticed in your work that
there's often really interesting sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses that often utilize sort of plants
that aren't really used in the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: like I think you mentioned earlier the
Tangy land I've noticed that you've used
[SPEAKER_00]: that one before and for me personally that
was a strain which I don't feel like you
[SPEAKER_00]: see it pop up all that often What was it
about the Tangy land for example that made
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it just a killer strain and do you in
general look to utilize plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which maybe aren't being used in other
people's breeding work or it's more just
[SPEAKER_04]: about what the plant has to offer Well,
yeah with the Tangy land the reason I used
[SPEAKER_04]: it because it had this straight like burnt
rubber Lemon Tangy vibe, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so it you know, it's purple had this look
at the smell but personally You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: whenever I do a lineup or whenever I'm
gonna pollinate I just kind of usually
[SPEAKER_04]: pick five or ten of my most favorite
strains at that moment and I just
[SPEAKER_04]: pollinate them, you know So it's not
there's not a whole lot of them head
[SPEAKER_04]: science to it It's more just like
intuition and what I feel like doing more
[SPEAKER_00]: than anything Sure, and when you make
strains in general, do you tend to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate all the females?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got maybe test them out and see
which ones are really working or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to conceptualize?
[SPEAKER_00]: It a bit more and think oh, you know this
female with this male is gonna work really
[SPEAKER_00]: well and make them a bit more like that on
say on paper more so than just haphazardly
[SPEAKER_04]: I think everything I do is kind of
haphazard.
[SPEAKER_04]: But um, yeah No, I mean like most of the
stuff I'm trying to line up together to to
[SPEAKER_04]: make it pencil out in the end You know,
so if I'm doing a bunch of OGs,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna you know, do some OG oriented
towards those You know, I'm not gonna try
[SPEAKER_04]: to mix the turd profiles up too much
because I don't want you know I've
[SPEAKER_04]: experienced that with The hazy that
anything I cross hazy with it would turn
[SPEAKER_04]: into hazy, you know, so it was like That
wasn't the best with some things,
[SPEAKER_04]: but some things would work out really good
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome So when you do make a new strain,
do you like to test it in-house?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you test it with testers and how many
seeds do you like to see popped?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so to get an idea of what's inside that
gene pool usually everything I give I give
[SPEAKER_04]: to two different people my one friend and
In Peru and he tests a lot of things down
[SPEAKER_04]: there and then another friend in Southern
Oregon that tests Them down there and the
[SPEAKER_04]: outside environments outside greenhouse
and all that so I'd like to do a pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty rigorous test and I You know like
to give it to my friends and have them run
[SPEAKER_04]: it and tell me what they think and all
that kind of thing so I'm not just trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to release stuff I have but that's not
that's not what I'm trying to do In the
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff that I have released without testing
I test and then You know just to make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: to you know, I've I have sent some strains
out that I haven't tested But then I've
[SPEAKER_04]: later tested them and feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not that big a deal But yeah,
for the most part I'm trying to test
[SPEAKER_04]: everything I mean, but me personally,
you know all I'm gonna do in my own
[SPEAKER_04]: personal testing realities is pop ten
seeds and if I can't get a Superstar out
[SPEAKER_04]: of those ten seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not not not something I'm really
wanting to release to be honest Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It raises an interesting Sort of question
because for the longest time there's been
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of this Underlying idea in the
community that you have to test your seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: before you release them and then more
recently We've seen the advent of breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: who are open about the fact they say,
you know, I'm selling these seeds They're
[SPEAKER_00]: not tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're quite open about it But then
they're still and and like in a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: regard people are like, oh, well,
that's okay You know you're being upfront
[SPEAKER_00]: about it But then you know when maybe
they've got a bone to pick with that same
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll then be like well you don't test
Your seeds, you know, and it's sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: like do you feel there is an expectation
to test seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you feel like just being honest is
more important and it actually doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think being honest is the number
one thing that should be happening if
[SPEAKER_04]: people want to risk You know because I've
just recently sold stuff that's untested
[SPEAKER_04]: because people wanted it so bad and I said
dude I haven't tested it but if you want
[SPEAKER_04]: to rock it I'll sell them to you,
but I'm just telling you man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't tested them So I don't know and
they're like I don't care So it's cool,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know honesty is the key, you know I
mean me personally I think ethically I
[SPEAKER_04]: want to test my gear because I don't want
to send stuff out to people That's not
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna do good Maybe not gonna germinate
good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not gonna perform good.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't I don't want that for people even
if I But if it doesn't perform good
[SPEAKER_04]: because of their conditions then it's
okay, too You know, I have a hundred
[SPEAKER_04]: percent money-back guarantee Not money
back, but I'll just replace your seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you packs of seeds if you don't
even like anything You don't like the way
[SPEAKER_04]: it smelled.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't like the way it grew.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't pop for you It wasn't as strong
as you wanted whatever you just let me
[SPEAKER_04]: know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just give you new seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care It's not a big deal,
you know, so That's just kind of where my
[SPEAKER_00]: ethos is on that on that Yeah,
I saw your post on Instagram and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: really impressed with your return policy
in case people aren't aware It's just
[SPEAKER_00]: basically saying that no matter who you
got the seeds from no matter how you came
[SPEAKER_00]: about Acquiring them like if you've got
the packaging and you can show me You know
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were my seeds and you're unhappy
with the results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll sort of sort you out with something
going forward Do you think that that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: policy that other breeders should adopt
more?
[SPEAKER_00]: So going forward or what's your thoughts
on the way other breeders offer return
[SPEAKER_00]: policies?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that notably some breeders are you
know quite reluctant to offer replacement
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds Do you feel like there's a happy
medium or do you feel like your policy is
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of the best option going forward?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh I don't I don't think I you know people
can do whatever they want It's not my
[SPEAKER_04]: business what other breeders do or what
other people are doing, you know I just do
[SPEAKER_04]: what I do because that's what I like to do
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way I like to do it That's what
makes me feel good in the end,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know You know Yeah, what other people
do is not my business.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know I don't want to try to make a
standard for everyone how they should
[SPEAKER_04]: think and be you know That's already
happened enough this last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's stupid.
[SPEAKER_04]: So
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Understandable and I mean recently
there's been a lot of discussion over the
[SPEAKER_00]: past year or so about this idea of if you
buy a packet of seeds Are you entitled to
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of do with them what you want?
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if you find a male from those
seeds should you breed with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: do you feel like it's okay for someone if
they've bought a packet of seeds to go
[SPEAKER_00]: ahead and breed with it and because I
think you know, we've kind of seen some
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders who get a little bit upset at
that and It does raise this question of
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Well, if you've bought the seeds
like do you truly own them in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can do what you want with the
progeny?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, don't you I mean you bought them you
own them it's like that's kind of how I
[SPEAKER_04]: look at it and I've already given everyone
the pass to do whatever they want with my
[SPEAKER_04]: Genetics and they don't have to credit me.
[SPEAKER_04]: They only have to give me name.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have to give me anything I
don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: They bought it, you know, do whatever they
want.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a plant the plants free,
you know Freedom is free too, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so do what you wish.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not the I'm not The boss and I'm not
the gatekeeper, you know, so I think
[SPEAKER_04]: people should be able to do whatever they
want with whatever they own I think they
[SPEAKER_04]: should be able to do whatever they want in
their own mind in their own actions I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't want to be the one that controls it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when people do ask me, hey man,
is it cool?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, do whatever you want rename it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever you want do whatever you want
That's called freedom and I'm into that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing Yeah strong point there I
like that So on a kind of different note
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen on your Instagram that there
were some photos I saw of these really
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive looking plants that were
growing in Greenhouses and as far as I was
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned they look as good as some of the
top sort of indoor you see Do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that greenhouse grown product will become
a mainstay of the industry going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think there ever might come a
time when it gains?
[SPEAKER_00]: The sort of top shelf status over indoor
or do you think indoors just always
[SPEAKER_00]: probably gonna hold that title?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think I mean Personally,
I think mixed light greenhouse is probably
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna be a way of the future at every
level Because you're gonna be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: advance and get higher trichome
cannabinoid counts when you do a Sun plus
[SPEAKER_04]: mixed lighting Because you have the Sun
plus you have these other spectrums That
[SPEAKER_04]: are artificial and that does something I
think even just light deprivation
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse with proper climate controlled
greenhouse Is gonna be is gonna be the
[SPEAKER_04]: future?
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally just because of the overhead
and the P&L's and ROI of what that product
[SPEAKER_04]: is so You know me personally Even with all
that greenhouse herb it was grown so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was so tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just and I smoked a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I Still prefer indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just me, you know But if I were to
You know If I were to have grown the
[SPEAKER_04]: greenhouse in the same Boundary of
protocol as I would have the indoor I mean
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a way of the future really To
have a climate controlled Non artificially
[SPEAKER_04]: lit with artificial supplementation I
think that's just a way of the future
[SPEAKER_04]: honestly I'm not a fan of outdoor herb
meaning like full season grown outside
[SPEAKER_04]: like with all the dust and all the Dirt
and all the wind and all the conditions
[SPEAKER_04]: beating on the plant the whole time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not really I'm not a fan of smoking
that personally But I'm a huge fan of
[SPEAKER_04]: smoking controlled climate controlled
greenhouse Yeah, certainly and on that
[SPEAKER_00]: topic of greenhouses, what's your thoughts
about big ag's move into the Canna space
[SPEAKER_00]: there seems to be a lot of concern about
it But we've also seen on the other end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the spectrum that a lot of the Canadian
LPs and Some of the American ones have
[SPEAKER_00]: been kind of going bankrupt like dominoes
in a sense over the past few years Do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think this is a growing trend and do you
think we do need to be concerned about big
[SPEAKER_00]: ag moving into the canna space?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think we need to be
concerned it's gonna happen You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm most my products that I buy are from
big ag suppliers, you know, so Why why
[SPEAKER_04]: would you buy beneficial bugs from like
your grow store?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get them from a big ag supplier.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's gonna be like a tenth of the cost,
you know Why would you buy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Gallons when you can buy 55 gallon or you
know totes or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just doesn't make sense You know,
the only way you can get those is usually
[SPEAKER_04]: from you know, big ag, you know Because
they're the the housing housing formats
[SPEAKER_04]: for these, you know, so I mean,
I'm not worried about it I like I like the
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the big ag influx to be honest
because They have a lot of knowledge and
[SPEAKER_04]: information of scaling that just isn't in
the cannabis industry Certainly,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something I try to keep in mind
because I I forget who we were having a
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion with but we were talking to
someone one time about how a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of Processes and technology that are
kind of being toted as the the newest and
[SPEAKER_00]: most improved in the cannabis industry
We're often pioneered by big ag in like
[SPEAKER_00]: the 30s or the 40s even what's your What's
your thoughts on the idea that they have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good place to play in the sense that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably gonna end up producing
sort of more of like the bud light
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent for the casual enthusiasts And
then the older heads are sort of the craft
[SPEAKER_00]: brewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you subscribe to that sort of idea?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what I what I see happening is
basically there are some collaborations
[SPEAKER_04]: happening with with a lot of this because
When we start working with big ag And we
[SPEAKER_04]: start working with these bigger bigger
companies they're gonna want to work with
[SPEAKER_04]: people like us because we're gonna be the
ones holding the Relationship to the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: information.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna be the ones holding all the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna be the ones that can You know
with with their with their input and with
[SPEAKER_04]: their information and with their help and
our help Really reach new heights of this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, you know, that's just my
perspective Mel Certainly in do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: there are any specific lessons that the
big producers could learn from the
[SPEAKER_00]: small-time growers and I guess
specifically what I'm interested in is
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be this critical point
where at a certain point in scaling up the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality just inherently goes down Do you
think that there's something the big
[SPEAKER_00]: producers could learn from the more craft
growers to get over that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it's just a problem of
scale?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think it's a problem of scale
personally, but I think the cultivation
[SPEAKER_04]: aspect is is not something that It's gonna
be hindered so much by scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's more of the More of the
processing aspects that are limited by
[SPEAKER_00]: scale Yeah, okay interesting So do you
think that there will always kind of be a
[SPEAKER_00]: spot in the market for the mom-and-pop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Connoisseur producer or do you think with
the changing laws?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna become harder and harder Well,
it's for sure gonna become harder and
[SPEAKER_04]: harder for the mom-and-pop because unless
that mom-and-pop is working with someone
[SPEAKER_04]: that can take it to the next level It's
gonna be really difficult for them to
[SPEAKER_04]: survive That's just how it goes,
you know, and that's how we've seen in
[SPEAKER_04]: every other industry if you even look at
the whiskey industry with like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know bourbons or like, you know Craft
beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the same, you know Most most these
mom-and-pops aren't you know, or even the
[SPEAKER_04]: small craft breweries.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not mom-and-pops.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're You know a Diva style artist
that's backed by someone with money You
[SPEAKER_04]: know that so you got this craft brewer
that's a high-end brewer and then they're
[SPEAKER_04]: backed with By you know a hedge funder or
a friend that's got money or something
[SPEAKER_04]: like that to take it to this next level So
most these craft breweries are like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, so if we look at that industry
You know doesn't look good for the
[SPEAKER_00]: mom-and-pop little grower and Mendo,
you know Yeah, sure So do you think that
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a necessary step in progressing
forward is that people kind of look to
[SPEAKER_00]: reach out and make these partnerships or
you know foster a sort of more friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: Relationship with other people because at
the moment we see a lot of people trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to create their own little brand with a
small team Do you think maybe it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous to try to do something on a
bigger scale in partnership with other
[SPEAKER_00]: people?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean even like myself if I wouldn't have
made the partnerships that I have Whether
[SPEAKER_04]: they be friends or whether they be
Colleagues whether they be whatever they
[SPEAKER_04]: are if I wouldn't have made these
partnership friendships connections
[SPEAKER_04]: relations I wouldn't be able to succeed
like I'm about to It just wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_04]: possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is with the right relations.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is with the right connections So that's
just how I see it if if anyone thinks
[SPEAKER_04]: they're gonna do it on their own I mean
good luck because how are you gonna fund
[SPEAKER_04]: that?
[SPEAKER_04]: We even see how the California industry
pretty much shut down anyone with under a
[SPEAKER_04]: million dollars, you know so meaning a
Liquid million dollars that you're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: just throw away, you know Yeah,
that's been a focal point of discussion on
[SPEAKER_00]: the past few episodes and most notably
we've seen there's a bit of an exodus of
[SPEAKER_00]: people from California going to other
states notably places like Oklahoma and a
[SPEAKER_00]: few other places that have got sort of a
more lax Set of rules at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think these states will basically
continue to flourish or do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Legalities and the things which have
turned a California into what it is right
[SPEAKER_00]: now will eventually catch up with these
other states No, I think some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: states saw that saw what California did
and didn't want to do that, you know They
[SPEAKER_04]: saw what happened and they didn't want to
do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They wanted to actually create business
for their for their state versus
[SPEAKER_04]: California basically creating so many
hurdles were business isn't gonna happen
[SPEAKER_04]: in the state unless you're You know unless
you got a huge backbone of cash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Yeah, it's been really difficult for
people I think that way Are there any
[SPEAKER_00]: states that have kind of particularly
stood out to you is seeming more kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: welcoming to people who are looking to get
a Get their business up and running or
[SPEAKER_00]: would you say look if you're doing it now,
just do it where you're at now and just do
[SPEAKER_00]: a good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Mean Oregon Oregon it's been pretty
easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most states that are happening now are
pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oklahoma's really easy You know,
obviously in Michigan, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: New York's gonna pop off soon Florida
these places are you know, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: them are they're hurdled through Licensing
hurdles, you know So, I mean for me
[SPEAKER_04]: personally I mean, I don't I don't I'm not
telling anyone to get into the industry to
[SPEAKER_04]: be honest because You know, I don't think
it's a good play unless you've already
[SPEAKER_04]: figured it out You know or unless you're
coming with something new or something hot
[SPEAKER_04]: to the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean a new brand really Now it's a
little late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you know Yeah for sure So
something I wanted to chat to you about is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you are a passionate fan like myself
of organics So I'd love to know what is
[SPEAKER_00]: your recommendation for someone who's
looking to Get into organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're transitioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they've never grown before what sort
of a base setup you might recommend to
[SPEAKER_00]: them and do you You know follow a
particular style of organics or are you
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of a mix and match and use what
you like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I am I mainly use dries I'm coming
out with my own line and my own soil line
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's what I use right now is I'm
using all my own products that I'm in
[SPEAKER_04]: collaboration with another company that I
won't mention here right now I guess until
[SPEAKER_04]: we release, you know but we're all in
licensing process right now of offering a
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a start-to-finish soil and You
know three-part pelletized nutrient some
[SPEAKER_04]: you know liquid cold extract for us Thomas
liquid product, you know these kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: things that are Basically, that's my love.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I use now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use that with a couple other products,
you know, I use a You know a liquid food
[SPEAKER_04]: compost and then that's a liquid I use and
then I use Em also, so, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: just basically pretty simple organics but
You know a lot of dry amendments Very
[SPEAKER_04]: little products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't think you can buy any of
the products I use from the grow store.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Everything is either on bulk bulk ag or
you know, these type of these type of
[SPEAKER_04]: genre All organic though dry pelletized or
like I said, you know EM as a basically
[SPEAKER_04]: like a super lab, you know with a bunch of
other probiotic reality to it You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then the liquid food compost is hydro
hydrolyzed food compost They add enzyme to
[SPEAKER_04]: and break down the food compost to make a
liquid nutrient with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So So that's the basics Yeah, brilliant
and do you think that organics can be
[SPEAKER_00]: utilized or even Automated such that it
can be used by bigger facilities because
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a sort Of idea we've oh for sure
heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've heard a lot of people say that
you just don't see it happening Do you see
[SPEAKER_00]: a day where there will be you know,
a big producer who utilizes no till or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean like even our bars is a
somewhat no till but yeah, like Honestly,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's gonna have to love the plant,
you know, because this organics thing
[SPEAKER_04]: isn't for the money it's for the love of
it and The the PNL and ROI of it works and
[SPEAKER_04]: it can scale heavily If you know what
you're doing if you don't for sure you're
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna fail And you're not gonna produce
what you need.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you know what you're doing then you're
gonna succeed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it can You know, the thing is just
the yield of convention is better,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know So you're gonna get more you're
gonna get more more more herb with
[SPEAKER_04]: chemicals, you know And I haven't been
able to get more weight out of organics
[SPEAKER_04]: yet I've been able to match it and I've
been ate with through LED and all this
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of stuff, but I haven't been able to
surpass conventional weights conventional
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation weights with organics yet But
I won't you know, personally, I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: ingest anything that's grown with
conventional salts and all that So,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean even if I grew with that I wouldn't
be able to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So You know, that's just what's up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I only I personally only smoke organic
herb I usually 95% of the time eat only
[SPEAKER_04]: organic Food so obviously unless I'm going
to a restaurant things like this,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, so it's just how I this is how
my makeup is Yeah, certainly I I subscribe
[SPEAKER_00]: to the same sort of ideas and trying to
eat organic where possible and you raise
[SPEAKER_00]: this sort of interesting idea in my mind
that a lot of people who grow organic tend
[SPEAKER_00]: to become more conscious of these sort of
things about the types of food they're
[SPEAKER_00]: ingesting and trying to get more nutrient
dense food or inputs wherever possible and
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Even Bodhi who said that
you know organics can be like a gateway to
[SPEAKER_00]: just gardening in general Do you agree
with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that you also tend to just
grow potatoes and you know Just whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: it may be because you've learned about how
to grow organically with cannabis or was
[SPEAKER_00]: it the other way around for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how did that work?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it was kind of the other way around
for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I learned to grow I mean Eugene if you had
You know chem weed like hydro grown weed
[SPEAKER_04]: and Eugene you're like looked down upon,
you know If you didn't have like the
[SPEAKER_04]: dankest Organic herb you weren't like
anyone in Eugene, you know, that's kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: just how the vibe was there You know,
it wasn't like you're busting out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got this hydro Do you check out this
hydro weed is so dank.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just not what's not happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would be at last at there,
you know That's just how the culture was
[SPEAKER_04]: there, you know, so it's just different
You know, I don't know it's interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned that because in places in
other spots in California and around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world You know for the longest time,
you know, I got that hydro was touted as
[SPEAKER_00]: being the beast Knees, but I feel like in
the last few years at least in this sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of educated consumers mind the indoor
no-till Organic cannabis has become
[SPEAKER_00]: synonymous with the highest quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you found this to be true in your
experience?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm still waiting for people to
give me a jar of weed that's danker than
[SPEAKER_04]: my jar of weed I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not saying that I got the best weed by
any means, but I sure would love Someone
[SPEAKER_04]: to give me a jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's better so I can smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay Interesting and then I want to and I
want to be friends with that person Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, have you ever been given any jars
that were particularly impressive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not better, but just still quite
impressive People don't usually give me
[SPEAKER_04]: weed for some reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand why There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right people we're putting the call
out I mean I have one friend that is from
[SPEAKER_04]: Eugene that I I always enjoyed his herb
and his herb was always dank as a good
[SPEAKER_04]: buddy my Brent his IG handles Fenario
farms and I Got to say that in Eugene.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like we're the two of the better
you know organic Growers over the last
[SPEAKER_04]: couple decades there and I think you know,
we're still two brands kicking out of that
[SPEAKER_04]: town still so That must have meant
something for all those years Certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: and you raise another good little segue
here and that I noticed in some of your
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses you utilized The dog walker og
which was made by a friend of the show one
[SPEAKER_00]: eye who's also based out of Oregon and it
got me wondering Do you find there's like
[SPEAKER_00]: networking and friendships within the
Oregon community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you friends with one eye for example,
or?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love rich.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's he's cool as shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah for sure Rich is a good guy I mean,
it's a it's a tight scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone knows each other I'm not to say
everyone gets along with each other
[SPEAKER_04]: because there's a lot of weird jealousies
and envies and you know obtuse
[SPEAKER_04]: perspectives Based out of ignorance and
all that kind of stuff just like normal
[SPEAKER_04]: humanity, you know And then you know how
organ is Everyone thinks they're the best
[SPEAKER_04]: at it and everyone thinks they're the you
know, I mean got the best or do the best
[SPEAKER_04]: or whatever You know, it's a weird weird
weird area and they wanted to you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: they want the best for the cheapest That's
Oregon, you know That's like that's all
[SPEAKER_00]: old people buying packs, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean it's even in the like,
you know any any anywhere Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: most people don't even most people don't
even know what good is nationally,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, that's just how it is I've seen
I've seen all the I've seen worker,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know I've seen boxes on boxes on boxes
of the most exotic hyper that's like
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever and it's fucking garbage so it's
like You know, I don't know what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening, you know So you raised an
interesting point which I was discussing
[SPEAKER_00]: with a friend a few years back in that
we're at a growers market in downtown
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland and he had a jar of headband from
Bob Hemphill and he also had a jar of some
[SPEAKER_00]: wedding cake from someone else and The the
wedding cake it had the look it had the
[SPEAKER_00]: aesthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was frosty, but there was no turps to
it It didn't leave a lasting impression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really kind of quite lackluster in
a certain regard and yet the headband It
[SPEAKER_00]: hit you in the face with these loud turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the real cut It just had everything
you wanted from a headband and yet my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend was saying to me You know these
jars will sell for the same amount and I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought to myself how can that Be like the
headband is clearly head and shoulders
[SPEAKER_00]: above this wedding cake and he was saying
yeah But you know the average consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: they used to that headband smell They've
smelted over the past 10 years a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: times and the wedding cake It's all the
bees knees and the rage online at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment So my question is how do we go
about educating the community or the
[SPEAKER_00]: casual?
[SPEAKER_00]: Enthusiast if this is the sort of dynamic
we're dealing with at the moment Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the thing is people are uneducated
and they're not going to get educated
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there's only honestly a few places
in the world that have cannabis education
[SPEAKER_04]: on you know, high-level organics or
Culture cannabis culture all that kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty slim, you know NorCal from
Santa Cruz to NorCal the Eugene not even
[SPEAKER_04]: Portland I would say but Eugene I Mean
there was a culture that was happening
[SPEAKER_04]: there for a long time especially before
Weed was legal everywhere, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so that culture is something that's not
gonna happen anymore and only few people
[SPEAKER_04]: have that perspective and understanding so
of course it makes sense why all this
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone doesn't know, you know,
how could you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know a gelato cross That's grown with
salt that has no turps is better than a
[SPEAKER_04]: good headband, you know Or whatever,
you know or a good og or a good,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it's just It's just there's just
it's lack of education, you know lack of
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding And lack of perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my perspective, you know Yeah,
sure So I mean on a different note,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would be some advice for an aspiring
breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a question we commonly get asked
by the fans How would you recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: someone go about getting their foot into
the scene and maybe getting some crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: out there to the masses?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I don't know I mean I would I Wouldn't
suggest people to start breeding to be
[SPEAKER_04]: honest, you know Not to make money if they
want to breed just for their self and
[SPEAKER_04]: getting getting seeds out there I think
they should just pick whatever intuitively
[SPEAKER_04]: they like the best whatever they strive
for the most and Do that again on the male
[SPEAKER_04]: side blend them and like start just making
stuff and giving seeds out and you know Do
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever they can to get seeds out but not
to make money, you know, I wouldn't I
[SPEAKER_04]: wouldn't suggest anyone To get into
breeding right now It's pointless Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a bit saturated in your opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean you can imagine some new
Strain person or new breeder that's gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: be new and doesn't have any track record
history You know street cred or any of
[SPEAKER_04]: that trying to make a business out of
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't know Good luck.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know and I would I just don't
suggest it person I suggest if you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: breed right now just breed for the love of
it and You know, and if you want to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: for the money then don't you kind of raise
an interesting point Which we've discussed
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit in the past in that is it
possible for someone to get in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming to the game so late specifically I
often hear this referenced in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: like vape carts and maybe products which
in the past there have been a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of shady practices, you know, is it
possible for someone to start a company
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make a Product like that or
trying to sell cannabis or breed seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: with good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it just simply like the boats left?
[SPEAKER_04]: I Mean, I personally think the boats left
but that's just that's just me,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know I mean if you're if you got a
huge hedge fund and you have unlimited
[SPEAKER_04]: money and you want to throw You know
quarter million half a million at branding
[SPEAKER_04]: and you want to like do it like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you can make it, you know Because
you we all understand it's all optics
[SPEAKER_04]: right now, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're if you Got the money to brand
hard and get into those optics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you can happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: No problem, but No one that's from the
street or no one that's from the industry
[SPEAKER_04]: that's known anything is gonna care and
give you respect that's just how I see it
[SPEAKER_00]: but Yeah, certainly tough crowd out there
Certainly and on that topic of a sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: changing landscape I've noticed that the
breeding landscape itself is starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: change a bit and we're beginning To see
breeders like for example JBZ Step away
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed selling as the main Avenue and
more so looking into licensing their cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: or their sort of cultivations to different
facilities Do you see this as something
[SPEAKER_00]: which will continue to happen going
forward and do you think we risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe getting to a point where home
growers are kind of finding it hard to get
[SPEAKER_00]: good quality seeds if that continues Well,
I think it's hard already to get quality
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds I mean I've I've tested a lot of
stuff and the reason I'm I'm doing what
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing is because When I'd test a lot
of gear and try to find good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's hard for me to find, you know,
so You know, that's just my perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I started doing it myself and doing
what I wanted myself and trying to you
[SPEAKER_04]: know Make things out of my own intuition
and all that You know, so I think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty hard right now for people to You
know find good seed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, you know, I think it's hard to
find good genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's hard to find The truth,
you know, it's easy to find whatever but
[SPEAKER_04]: it's hard to find the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you know Unless you're unless
you're working with some some good old
[SPEAKER_04]: trusted people, you know and You know,
those are those are those are in the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry very obvious very easy to find it
seems like You know, there's a there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple handfuls of really Quality good
people that are breeding and and and they
[SPEAKER_04]: got the they got the credentials to back
them most of them while we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about that sort of You know bigger
facilities and working with things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that Have you ever been to facilities and
found certain cultivars that you think
[SPEAKER_00]: really work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well in a sort of bigger monocropped
environment and if so, which ones would
[SPEAKER_00]: you recommend?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean really any any columnar
style, you know Plant is gonna do good in
[SPEAKER_04]: a you know, giant sea of green or scaled
out grow, you know, it's pretty much like
[SPEAKER_04]: Low low brack to leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean low low leaf to brack ratio and
high testing and you know medium medium
[SPEAKER_04]: speed growing and It's it's just that you
know Most my breeding I'm trying to select
[SPEAKER_04]: for certain things like trimming and these
kind of things So not trying to grow breed
[SPEAKER_04]: a bunch of leafy stuff that doesn't have a
high cannabinoids, you know on the scale
[SPEAKER_04]: level though, I think that you know a lot
of the designers trains right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean There's a reason they're being
grown the way they're being grown,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they do well in those conditions
for sure I mean all that, you know gelato
[SPEAKER_04]: cookie cross kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's You know grows good in that style
Yeah, I mean you just mentioned that some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the traits that you're breeding for
being like, you know ease of trimming and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that if you had to list in
general some of the Traits that you think
[SPEAKER_00]: are advantageous and you look to have
within your projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would they be?
[SPEAKER_04]: turf profile cannabinoid Cannabinoid
production then structure term ability,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know brack to leaf ratio all that kind
of stuff for my Really specifics,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know almost in that order You know if
the turf profile and cannabinoid content
[SPEAKER_04]: those are equal for me and then they both
have to be awesome and then structure of
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant term ability That's kind of in
that order really the term ability and
[SPEAKER_04]: structure equal and you know Cannabinoid
and turf reality are equal to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: They should be taken into account equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my perspective Yeah,
nice nice list of traits there that you
[SPEAKER_00]: look to work into your lines I noticed
that you did some fems where you reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: the hazy cushion to some other females
What sort of results did you find from
[SPEAKER_00]: these crosses and did you find that the
hazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush was kind of dominating or a bit more
passive and let the other strains shine
[SPEAKER_04]: through They're right in the middle of
testing right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm about five five five five six
weeks in flowering right now, so It's all
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to show Are there any that have
sort of caught your eye early on or still
[SPEAKER_00]: yet to be seen?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's quite a few was sad as I reversed
the Luke Skywalker og And I crossed it by
[SPEAKER_04]: the purple Hindu Kush Thinking I was gonna
make this, you know make the infamous epic
[SPEAKER_04]: purple og instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a bunch of herms So anyway Life
yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there's something within those two
that just don't compute but on that topic
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that breeding with mothers
that come from fem seeds or even s ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more likely to make the opposite
Spring unstable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think it has that potential for
sure everything everything where the
[SPEAKER_04]: potential is there is gonna give that Give
that expression in some way or another
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, and a sort of hypothetical question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been asking guests lately is this
Let's just say you made a strain and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: producing the most amazing progeny you've
ever seen like without fail the best
[SPEAKER_00]: you've ever seen but the catch is There's
like 40% Hermes in the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you at that point think?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just got an 86 this project or
do you think you know, I'd release it I
[SPEAKER_00]: just warned people what to you is an
acceptable limit of Hermes if it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: really fire strain I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't release it if it was herming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just me Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Just don't want people to experience
that I don't think people are up to par
[SPEAKER_04]: and their cultivation skills enough to
catch it So I don't want to put that on
[SPEAKER_04]: them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't want to be responsible for that
Sure sure I mean if I were to have
[SPEAKER_04]: something and 40% of them would be Herm
just like this LSOG where 80% of them were
[SPEAKER_04]: Herm with the purple Hindu Kush I think
two of them weren't so I'm just I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: growing those two out still I'm hoping
they're gonna be really sick clones,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like clone only elites or
something, you know So they're not gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: get released but they're gonna be in
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure So maybe like the middle ground is if
you find a stable clone release the clone
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something which caught my eye on your
website was that you have a nice write-up
[SPEAKER_00]: about the Platinum Girl Scout cookies and
you kind of talk about how that's the Girl
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout cookies you commonly use and it got
me wondering What is it about the Platinum
[SPEAKER_00]: that really draws you towards it as
opposed to the myriad of other cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean the reason I just I'm a I'm
using that cookies cut is because it was
[SPEAKER_04]: the first cookies cut, you know,
so and You know, I just got it as Girl
[SPEAKER_04]: Scout cookie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just I just called it platinum,
you know Because it was there's a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: different cook cookie cuts going around
but my friend gave me that cut right when
[SPEAKER_04]: cookies came out and His name is Alec
Dixon and he owns SC labs and you know He
[SPEAKER_04]: got that cut from the boys right when it
right when I started going around he gave
[SPEAKER_04]: it to me So that's that cut so I just
called it the Platinum But it's I think
[SPEAKER_04]: it's just the original Girl Scout to be
honest Okay, and the are there any traits
[SPEAKER_00]: about that one which you think make it
sort of stand a little bit ahead of the
[SPEAKER_04]: others yeah, the tricone production the
vigor the The smell the funkiness of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like just rank.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like rank skunk fuel and cookies,
you know, so it was like It was like that
[SPEAKER_04]: smell plus it was just stronger than the
other ones that I've seen So and I noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: that you had done a cross of it with the
illusion OG, which I believe is a strain
[SPEAKER_00]: from compound genetics What was the story
on that cross and what drew you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Towards the illusion OG to use that as a
male.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well just this genetic profile and from my
understanding it's why he's genetics Jeff,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Jeff was the main breeder for
compound before that debacle happened and
[SPEAKER_04]: You know from my understanding Jeff from
why East was the one doing all the
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding and doing all the Penal hunting
and doing all the selecting and throwing
[SPEAKER_04]: all the pollen and collecting all the
genetics and all that so So anyway So that
[SPEAKER_04]: was actually from From from from why East
from Jeff from why East here?
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, even though you know,
there's a you know, there's a lot always
[SPEAKER_04]: lots of controversy with this kind of
thing But for me, it's the person that
[SPEAKER_04]: collected the genetics through the pollen
and grew it in their house is the owner so
[SPEAKER_00]: All that points to why East Sure credit
credit to why East I wouldn't want to not
[SPEAKER_04]: give you credit where credit's true Well,
I mean it just it's a it's just you know
[SPEAKER_04]: how it is this this this game where people
break up and you know Leave people off of
[SPEAKER_04]: trademark apps and do different things and
try to steal different things and do
[SPEAKER_02]: different things an interesting industry,
you know Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it was James being who
mentioned to me the other week that As far
[SPEAKER_00]: as he can recall swamp boys are the only
sort of breeding duo that have managed to
[SPEAKER_00]: stand the test of time And I think he
might be right Yeah, I don't really know
[SPEAKER_04]: but I think they're still friends,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's it that's it that's what
they're still they're still together so I
[SPEAKER_06]: don't think It's pretty rare Yeah,
certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean shout out to Jeff for
making that one Was there anything about
[SPEAKER_00]: the illusion og that drew to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you just say it was the traits of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what were they I mean the the OGs and
cams all up in it is kind of what what uh
[SPEAKER_04]: Why why I use it to be honest You know,
that's just those are my those are my
[SPEAKER_04]: those are my fave some of those things,
you know, so I just Wanted to use it,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know And there were some The reasons I
did it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was pretty unhappy with what happened on
With that whole breakup just not that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: not any of my business But you know,
I've just been treated like that from
[SPEAKER_04]: other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know the ghost og Skywalker og sfv
Chem dog sour, it's like those are all my
[SPEAKER_04]: favorites.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's Like yeah, I'll use this and so
when I talked to Jeff, I I talked him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said hey Jeff now, what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: I said I said I got this From Chris,
but who did this, you know who grew who
[SPEAKER_04]: grew this who grew this?
[SPEAKER_04]: He said I did I said word who selected the
strains who selected the cuts who?
[SPEAKER_04]: Grounded up the genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said I did I said where was it grown?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all grown in my house my garage I
said who threw the pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's lighted So, you know, those are
enough I dids to me, you know Yeah And I
[SPEAKER_04]: know so that I just you know what I mean
Yeah, it's just I just gave credit to
[SPEAKER_04]: where credit was due in my opinion But
that's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be wrong too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not saying I'm right I'm just
saying that's the reason I did it Yeah So
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean on a similar sort of note I've
noticed that you know, you're sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: friendship and collaborative network is
very Expansive and it got me thinking you
[SPEAKER_00]: would definitely have access to a just a
you know plethora of strains Which you
[SPEAKER_00]: know many people could only dream of
getting and it got me wondering Can we
[SPEAKER_00]: ever expect to see any sort of old school
meets new school strains from your work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the likes of like a land race
crossed to one of your males like a Malawi
[SPEAKER_00]: or an Acapulco gold I think for some
reason in my head it just I just sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: expected to see something like that and it
got me wondering Well, maybe maybe it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the works where it's yet to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, my friend Bob.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gave me some genetics he's gonna give
him to me again because some of them
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't make that make that make that
journey, but You know, there was some land
[SPEAKER_04]: race stuff that I was gonna collab with
him and you know and vice versa So yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's that's that's in the works too.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got some stuff from you know Yeah,
it's in the works for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kind of Honestly a lot of I'm not
a lot of my stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm making I'm trying to make stuff that
I'm gonna be like Oh, I'm so psyched on
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of selfish, but I'm not really
breeding for You know, I'm breeding for
[SPEAKER_04]: everyone else meaning I'm gonna be the one
to select it through my own intuition But
[SPEAKER_04]: then I'm just assuming other people will
like it because I'm the hard-headed in
[SPEAKER_04]: that in the tolerance level, you know,
so No, I think that's a common sense that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've heard from guests on the show is
that they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tend to breed for themselves and you know
the the crowd's favor tends to follow that
[SPEAKER_00]: sick something I wanted to ask You about
because I thought it was kind of cool in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way was the mystery Kush I liked that in
the sense that I Felt like it was sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: a misnomer of a name because you you
obviously know what it's made of you made
[SPEAKER_00]: it What was the story around that one and
why did you decided to give it the name?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the mystery when you know,
it's it's made from hazy Kush Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: like I was saying I didn't know actually
which one which what the male was I had to
[SPEAKER_04]: see but I didn't I didn't actually wasn't
positive, you know Until I tested it all
[SPEAKER_04]: so that's why it was mystery, but I'm like
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: This smells just like this hazy Kush No
calling this three haze, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then when I found out it wasn't a
mystery anymore It was obviously it was it
[SPEAKER_00]: was obvious, you know Sure, and how would
that one differ if someone was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: toying between getting those two?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you describe the differences?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean the hazy Kush is much more complex
To me much more desirable But the look and
[SPEAKER_04]: the appearance Of the mystery is just so
You know desirable in that end.
[SPEAKER_04]: I Don't actually don't like the high of
the mystery that much personally
[SPEAKER_04]: Comparatively to the hazy Kush is one of
my favorites sure So I noticed on your
[SPEAKER_00]: website that it's kind of geared a little
bit more towards what I felt was sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a management or sort of Consulting
role for potential clientele Is that
[SPEAKER_00]: something you hope to get into in the
future in terms of like helping?
[SPEAKER_00]: Facilities with their cultivar selection
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where do you see yourself in the
future in the industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Well, that's a big part of our future
to be honest because you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've created the conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on this new light.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's basically You know, I've tested a
lot of LEDs in the industry now and this
[SPEAKER_04]: one pretty much crushes all of them to
pieces There's not even a comparison and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's got a pathogen preventative On it
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's I mean, it's on another level.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really excited to release that And
then we're gonna release that with a full
[SPEAKER_04]: spectrum of you know consulting Genetics
the whole bit and we're we're positioned
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty heavily to do that with our
partners and with our group so We were
[SPEAKER_04]: just being patient hitting it at the right
time hitting it at the right moment and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the right way Do you see a day where maybe
green body?
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics are a little more rare and harder
to find because you're sort of more
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapped up in that side of things or do
you hope to sort Of be able to offer both
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm hoping to offer both because I
think they're go hand-in-hand and as the
[SPEAKER_04]: markets come on and international markets
come on You know, there's gonna be a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of things happening We got a lot of stuff
working in Jamaica right now with some
[SPEAKER_04]: partners and we got a lot of stuff getting
ready to start happening that we're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: start Potentially doing some international
seed distribution and yet either out of
[SPEAKER_04]: there or out of Canada We're gonna you
know, it's like there's a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: getting ready to start happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really excited about all of it
That's that's awesome to hear and sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting stuff something which I've been
talking to a lot of guests about recently
[SPEAKER_00]: is There seems to be a bit of like a
cognitive dissonance that like if it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: a fancy package You know sort of
reflective mylar bag that it's got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest quality Do you think that
people will ever maybe learn to dissociate
[SPEAKER_00]: the packaging from the actual contents?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that's just marketing and
you got a role with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think it's both, you know,
we understand how marketing is right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know You look at the alcohol how
things are packaged.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's you know, it makes a difference You
know, you look at even these CBD lines and
[SPEAKER_04]: CBS or any like these, you know these
stores, you know It's the one the
[SPEAKER_04]: packaging is what's selling it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the product, you know,
they're all the same product So if it's
[SPEAKER_04]: something says Charlotte's web on it
versus something says something it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: sell more, you know Yeah, sure I mean we
see that cookies is continuing to expand
[SPEAKER_00]: and release more and more product onto the
market Notably they've been outsourcing
[SPEAKER_00]: some of their crops to other producers and
we've seen the odd issue With quality
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that these companies might
risk sort of shooting themselves in the
[SPEAKER_00]: foot by?
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to sell an inferior quality product
or do you think that their fans are sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of loyal to the brand and not necessarily
the product?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think cookies is a unique brand in
that context because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: brand loyalty and you know It doesn't
matter what they put in the bag It's gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the people are gonna buy it
because the branding they pretty much
[SPEAKER_04]: crushed the branding reality You know
there did really well And you know and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're good guys, you know So like a lot
of people have a lot of stuff to say about
[SPEAKER_04]: them, but they don't know these people,
you know You know, they're good guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's I've met them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're good people, you know,
they're cool You know, so they might have
[SPEAKER_04]: had some hurdles with some different
genetics or different seed sales or
[SPEAKER_04]: different this that and the other but you
know from what I'm seeing their branding
[SPEAKER_04]: level and what they're trying to do in the
industry is pretty professional and every
[SPEAKER_04]: which way so You know, I don't know It
seems like a bunch of envy more than
[SPEAKER_04]: anything if people are crazy You're gonna
have haters and that's a big sign you're
[SPEAKER_04]: crushing it too, you know so You know,
I mean we we have some we have some stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: in in future with cookies and stuff,
too So I think people should be excited
[SPEAKER_04]: about that more than anything that's
happening now, you know Once we start
[SPEAKER_04]: throwing, you know golden pineapple to
Georgia pie and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Putting putting our twist on
these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's when people should start
getting really excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, maybe I'm just self-centered
in that perspective Wow, that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really exciting to hear that you've got
that sort of collaboration down the
[SPEAKER_00]: pipeline I know that you've done
collaborations in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they the sort of thing that you want
to pursue more going forward?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah collaborations are fun a lot of stuff
happens and it's good branding,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know it's um, so all those all those
conditions are kind of the Conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I like it Sure, and I know that
I've heard a bit recently about a
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration you have with mass medical
strains Where can people find those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: or when can they expect to be able to get
them if they're after them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what sort of plants do you feel those
crosses offer?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, well-grown seeds is going to be one
of the big the big hubs for that those
[SPEAKER_04]: co-labs well-grown seeds cool beans you
know, so Yeah, I mean, you know masses
[SPEAKER_04]: masses a cool kid, you know and a lot of
people have You know, well not a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people there's been specific few people
that have tried to bully the kid and
[SPEAKER_04]: that's one of the reasons I am I jumped on
you know, cuz I like bullies Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: and when I was younger I stood like beat
up bullies, you know So now I'll just make
[SPEAKER_04]: fun of them on Instagram instead,
you know for being bullies, you know for
[SPEAKER_04]: bullying a kid that's you know Trying to
do good things and he's a good guy,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know and doesn't he didn't do the
things that these people are saying he did
[SPEAKER_04]: so I wanted to make a you know Make it
known and that's the reason I'm collabing
[SPEAKER_04]: with him is because I don't like people
bullying kids You know, it's not it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So You know, I think the collaboration
between us and what we're doing and the
[SPEAKER_04]: the the strains coming out are gonna be
quite unique, you know very colorful
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously rich in turps on the multitude
of levels and they're just gonna be good
[SPEAKER_04]: vibe seeds, you know where people are just
trying to do good things and you know help
[SPEAKER_04]: people and do good stuff and That's kind
of you know a lot of those things are
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna be really neat coming out of those
crosses I think you know just the color
[SPEAKER_04]: the color really he's He's he's good at
bringing in that color and I think the
[SPEAKER_04]: combo with the with with our strength and
high octane profiles with his You know
[SPEAKER_04]: color and turf realities are gonna gonna
make some cool combos, you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's it that's exciting to hear that the
the crosses are offering such,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know desirable characteristics
Something which I heard Interestingly sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of mentioned and I specifically wanted to
ask you about this was that someone said
[SPEAKER_00]: to me or you know the the reason why he
decided to not retire and come back was
[SPEAKER_06]: because green Bodhi convinced him not to
That's true Another bit of speculation
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've seen from numerous sources was
that he came back for more or less
[SPEAKER_00]: financial reasons You know regardless of
whether that's true or not is not really
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm interested in more So what I'm
interested in is this idea of the ethics
[SPEAKER_00]: behind breeders releasing seeds for profit
intentionally Every breeder is selling
[SPEAKER_00]: their seeds to pay the bills like why why
is that like a point of contention?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like at times people just pick
points to criticize because they've just
[SPEAKER_00]: got a bone to pick like, you know People
sell seeds for five hundred dollars a pack
[SPEAKER_00]: and people don't really get as up-and-arms
as about you and Mass Medical selling some
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds for what's arguably probably a much
more reasonable price Do you think that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is this sort of vitriol in the
community?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh For sure for sure, you know,
it's like Mass will sell out a drop in
[SPEAKER_04]: like one day, you know So of course that
makes these old breeders that can't sell
[SPEAKER_04]: their seeds Madden jealous and envious,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean just I could I can go on for days
about this kind of topic but So,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, no mass was just You know,
he was getting sick of it, you know He's
[SPEAKER_04]: getting sick of people just hating on him
and for no reason really, you know Like
[SPEAKER_04]: because even the the reasons that were
given to me by the person stirring up the
[SPEAKER_04]: pot the most You know, he told me he
screwed over Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_04]: This person told me that Mass screwed over
Bodhi seeds, you know, so I asked him I
[SPEAKER_04]: said, hey bro, what's up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this true?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's all no, that's not true I would never
put myself in a position to be screwed
[SPEAKER_04]: over that's what Bodhi told me and I said,
thank you and Then so then I said all
[SPEAKER_04]: these guys are full of it and you know
what?
[SPEAKER_04]: They kept trying to they kept trying to
because this guy, you know mass is um,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, he he was Doing this finger
boarding thing when he was younger and he
[SPEAKER_04]: started a company He was selling like
finger boards and stuff and they kept
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to like pick on him for that,
you know Oh, he's this guy He's that
[SPEAKER_04]: person he's that he's like So what you
know, really guys care that much about
[SPEAKER_04]: this kid, you know, like what's your
problem?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know now and then it seemed like
everyone was bullying him.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just was like, oh, yeah Well,
you try and bully me then, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: so then I jumped on jumped on board with
him, you know So if everyone wants to
[SPEAKER_04]: bully then they can bully him.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can bully me You know, that's kind of
why I did this, you know, and if anyone
[SPEAKER_04]: wants to bully Him or anyone wants to be
that kind of guy Well, I'm down to go to
[SPEAKER_04]: my Jits gym and we can have a You know
live IG like Jits battle in the gym and
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, we'll see then you know,
who's a bully?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't I don't I'm not a fan of
people picking on kids You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a fan of people picking on each
other, you know, that's that's BS,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know So if you want to pick on people
then you can pick on people that are that
[SPEAKER_04]: are that will welcome it You know in front
of everybody, you know, and so I made
[SPEAKER_04]: those, you know I made that very clear in
the industry that I'm you know willing to
[SPEAKER_04]: do whatever you know and then seemed like
everyone just got Kind of quiet then for
[SPEAKER_04]: some reason So it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I definitely have seen a lot of what
you mentioned there, which is really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting and it kind of raised this
broader idea which I really disagreed with
[SPEAKER_00]: which was that With that finger boarding
comment in mind people were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know He's had this successful company
in the past and he's just coming to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis scene to make money and it made
me think Like is it not possible to have
[SPEAKER_00]: been successful in another business
endeavor and then come to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: scene because as far as I could tell that
was what was going on But people tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it out as though like well because
you have this successful business in
[SPEAKER_00]: another industry You're definitely here
just to sell out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean who cares what people think for one
I know for sure that Mass is in it for the
[SPEAKER_04]: right reasons, you know And of course he's
gonna do it and make money too because
[SPEAKER_04]: that's just normal, you know, it's not bad
Your intention is what makes it bad You
[SPEAKER_04]: know if you're doing it just to make money
then that's not the best, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but that's not what he's doing or for I've
talked to him for hours and hours and
[SPEAKER_04]: hours and You know, we go back to that
thing where someone said always green boat
[SPEAKER_04]: He got him to you know, get back into the
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I did I told him that he shouldn't
have jumped out It makes him look bad and
[SPEAKER_04]: he's he's innocent.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's in do anything wrong, you know
There's not one thing he did wrong not
[SPEAKER_04]: one, you know No one's been able to prove
anything They just try to pick on him for
[SPEAKER_04]: this finger boarding thing and it's like
dude You guys sound like those bullies
[SPEAKER_04]: that I'd like to like knock out,
you know for picking on my friends,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like Little stop, you know,
and I mean that's what that's where how
[SPEAKER_04]: this whole sale hatin thing came in You
know, it's cuz it's basically that's a
[SPEAKER_04]: strain That's a collab strain the hazy
Kush with the pootang is sale hatin and
[SPEAKER_04]: the reason it came about was because I got
tagged into Because someone was like Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: this green boat he's working with mass and
you know, this dude hates mass,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know And so they tagged me into his
page and I said, ah, I said, I don't know
[SPEAKER_04]: all this bickering and all this this
Gossipings above my pay grade I said,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and I said by the way,
I said who cares anyway about what I think
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I said my seeds suck my genetics
suck my weed sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't buy it You know, I said I'm the
fucking devil actually and then that's all
[SPEAKER_04]: the only time I commented towards all this
and then someone commented a few a few a
[SPEAKER_04]: few Comments down said sale hatin and I
was like, what are they like making fun of
[SPEAKER_04]: me?
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even understand what the fuck it
meant, you know I'm like sale hatin sale
[SPEAKER_04]: hatin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it took me a while to get it You know,
I was like is sale some I thought it was
[SPEAKER_04]: some type of new Millennium term,
you know It's how slow I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's these kind of things,
you know some things I'm not slow at this
[SPEAKER_02]: type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of slow this moment,
you know I was looking at them and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, ah Took me and then I laughed so
fucking hard So then that's what we
[SPEAKER_04]: started this sale hatin strain because of
that one thing, you know And then so
[SPEAKER_04]: basically I did this sale hatin strain did
a shirt of this like Buddha image and then
[SPEAKER_04]: this raffle deity image like a half and
half and they release, you know release
[SPEAKER_04]: shirts and then you know We all have our
techniques of trolling people,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know so That was my technique,
you know We'll just create a strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll create shirts, you know We'll do our
own way if you want to pick on people then
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll just make fun of you for being a
bully Instead in our own way, you know But
[SPEAKER_04]: for me, I don't like bullies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if someone wants to bully someone then
you know, I'm probably gonna You know Try
[SPEAKER_04]: to make them feel like they shouldn't do
that anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like people are so uptight right now
It's like come on lighten up a little bit,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, just just like help someone,
you know, that's why I'm doing this well
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, you know I'm doing this these uh,
these wells in India around the city of
[SPEAKER_04]: Bodhgaya, you know Because it's like man
everyone's so like uptight and I'm so pent
[SPEAKER_04]: up and about something like hey Why don't
you guys just help someone?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know instead of like putting your
energy on focusing on your illusory
[SPEAKER_04]: Aspects of your mind that creates
suffering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you just put that energy out and
help someone, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You help somebody, you know, it's like so
here's an opportunity You can help
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody, you know, it's really cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like anyway, I'm kind of like that
kind of guy that likes to Play these kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of games, you know You know by entangling
lots of people up putting wells into you
[SPEAKER_04]: know Poor villages in India that they
don't have water, you know What a perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: segue because I did wanted to ask you
about the the well project I had a written
[SPEAKER_00]: down as the the pump project.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did this all get started?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, um, you know first time I went to
India was in 2011 to receive a Kalashakra
[SPEAKER_04]: initiation in Bodhgaya from His Holiness
the Dalai Lama but first I went to
[SPEAKER_04]: Dharamsala and You know went to his
monastery there received Chakras and Vara
[SPEAKER_04]: empowerment there then went to Bodhgaya So
I met these two boys in Bodhgaya,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and they're a classic They just
wanted to take you around and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know how would make money off a
westerner and I told them I said hey man
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not that kind of westerner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to help I don't need anything
But if you want to hang out and you want
[SPEAKER_04]: to hang with me and go to all these cool
places I'll take you we can have we can be
[SPEAKER_04]: friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you know, it'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we can develop a friendship So
then every year after that, I you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: whenever I come to India and go to
Bodhgaya We hang out and we stayed in
[SPEAKER_04]: contact, you know now ten years later,
you know And I'd always told him I said
[SPEAKER_04]: man try to find something to do there You
know, like let's do something,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and then they've come with this
idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, maybe we should do this Well,
you know this one hand pump well,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know I said well you tell me how much
it cost show me all the you know labor
[SPEAKER_04]: costs all the pipe cost the hand pump cost
Show me the village where you're gonna do
[SPEAKER_04]: it and you show me say hey John This is
where we're gonna put the village.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey John.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's this hey John do that So I just you
know made him do step by step and then we
[SPEAKER_04]: did a well, you know and we Did it and put
a well in there and then I post on
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram, you know, and I said hey Maybe
you guys instead of blowing your you know
[SPEAKER_04]: covid check on something you blow it on
this You know that helps some people,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know And it kind of went viral,
you know now we put in I think eight or
[SPEAKER_04]: nine of them eight of them I'm not really
sure and I have funds for like 15 20 I
[SPEAKER_04]: think waiting now in line to do it,
you know, and these you can understand how
[SPEAKER_04]: India is India's caste system So these are
the lowest caste in the world,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know poorest poorest State in India
poorest Country in the world poorest state
[SPEAKER_04]: in that country or you know in that area
The poorest in Bihar region is the poorest
[SPEAKER_04]: region of India and these are the poorest
people of this region You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: they they call them untouchables lowest
caste, you know in this caste system there
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't even have that's all surface
level water.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have underground water.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't have water, you know,
so To be able to offer, you know these
[SPEAKER_04]: people water like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just something very simple,
but you know, you can see by the Images on
[SPEAKER_04]: these people's faces and everything how
happy they are to have water from
[SPEAKER_04]: underground river, you know And this is
very simple, you know $700 to do a hand
[SPEAKER_04]: pump well from start to finish,
you know Concrete pad everything little
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, so they have a little hand pump
well there, you know So they have fresh
[SPEAKER_04]: water now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if people don't understand,
you know, what kind of impact that can put
[SPEAKER_04]: on a community You know imagine,
you know now all these villages that were
[SPEAKER_04]: so poor Don't have fresh water probably
using bottle plastic water, whatever
[SPEAKER_04]: probably just whatever now they have fresh
water from underground river, you know You
[SPEAKER_04]: know, maybe 50 hundred persons in each
village, you know, so it's like Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to do this kind of thing feels cool
I like to involve lots of people do this
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of thing because you know from a
Buddhist perspective Since we're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: this project then anyone that's growing
our strains buying our seeds Buying our
[SPEAKER_04]: herb growing our herb Anyone that's
offering any type of money is towards our
[SPEAKER_04]: projects in any way from buying whatever
selling anything from a Buddhist
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective They're generating good karma
because we're doing these projects and
[SPEAKER_04]: we're helping as only as a Dalai Lama's
monastery We're helping all these things
[SPEAKER_04]: with our you know With our philanthropic
work and finances and things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So then anyone that's a part of our
Momentum is also from a Buddhist
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective generating those good karmas
They say, you know, so yeah It's just fun
[SPEAKER_00]: fun kind of stuff to do Yeah, what a
fantastic sort of charity or karma or
[SPEAKER_00]: paying it forward whoever you want to put
it very noble indeed How can people get in
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with you and or sort of donate
some money themselves if they were hoping
[SPEAKER_04]: to help out with that They just hit up my
DM on Instagram and then I just send them
[SPEAKER_04]: to the Venmo and we do the whole thing You
know, it's like very simple, you know each
[SPEAKER_04]: well to We'll do step by step.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see the wells that we've done.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the first one is usually them
saying hi So and so here's where the well
[SPEAKER_04]: is going when the guys, you know And so
we're trying to show that like hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is happening each time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fresh.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not some fake thing It's like here's
all the proof, you know here and everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: likes that, you know, so it's very simple
You know, they just hit up the DM on
[SPEAKER_04]: Instagram green Bodhi Say hey,
I want to get involved in one of these
[SPEAKER_04]: wells and I'll say okay This is what's up
and here's how you do it and they say okay
[SPEAKER_04]: boom boom boom and then they get in line
You know, like I said I have I think 18
[SPEAKER_04]: people in line right now already paid for
wells and they're just you know They're
[SPEAKER_04]: waiting their turn to get them get done,
you know Yeah, that's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you planning to do any other sort of
projects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not wells But similar sorts of thing
or do you think there's just still a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of work to be done with getting the pumps
in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean I had them His Holiness Dalai
Lama had given 34 Kalachakra initiations
[SPEAKER_04]: and the last one was in Bodh Gaya So I
wanted to do 34 wells first I want to do
[SPEAKER_04]: 21 wells because in Buddhist practices,
there's a Tara practice called 21 Tara's
[SPEAKER_04]: there's actually 21 of these Tara deities
that are you know represent long life or
[SPEAKER_04]: You know wealthy, you know healthy all
these different aspects of well-being and
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortune in the sense of health fortune
wealth fortune all these things they call
[SPEAKER_04]: them Tara, you know It's a Tara and
there's 21 of these Tara's so I was gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: do 21 but then I'm like Now we're gonna do
that really easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll do 34, you know, so maybe we do a
hundred who knows?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know as many villages as we can we'll
put them in there Maybe do something else
[SPEAKER_04]: ain't I'm sure there'll be some other type
of project that comes up right after this
[SPEAKER_04]: sure, but you know His Holiness the Dalai
Lama's Library Museum projects getting
[SPEAKER_04]: breaking around on May so and I
potentially will do something for that
[SPEAKER_00]: also or you know again Sure, and do you
hope that this sort of arms-giving Will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue in the community long term like
after the 34 wells are done Do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: any projects in mind for going forward or
do you think like at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully there's enough momentum that
people continue it on themselves Well,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I'll keep this going as long as I
can, you know I won't I won't stop as long
[SPEAKER_04]: as people keep giving me money to do these
wells.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll find a place to put it in India And
that's just how it goes For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: There'll be other projects and to do right
after This because that's just how it
[SPEAKER_04]: goes, you know, there's always something
to do to help people, you know There's
[SPEAKER_04]: never there's never an end to that in this
world right now Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of on that idea of paying it
forward a bit I noticed that recently
[SPEAKER_00]: you've done some CBD work, which is kind
of not as popular with the mainstream It's
[SPEAKER_00]: often viewed as sort of a more medicinal
endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on the CBD market?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's pretty open right now so you
know, we're gonna get involved in it just
[SPEAKER_04]: because we should but um, you know,
I'm I Like it for what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It created a good avenue to help everyone
be more familiar and make it more
[SPEAKER_04]: acceptable But you know, I'm not a I'm not
so much of a fan of the CBD scene.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like CBD and THC together personally so
Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see a lot of people discussing how
it's really important to know where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting your CBD from these days and I
guess it's sort of especially pertinent
[SPEAKER_00]: given we're seeing a lot of CBD come in
from various markets around the world
[SPEAKER_00]: International places like China often get
referenced Do you think that most CBD is
[SPEAKER_00]: of good quality or it really does matter
where you're getting it from?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it matters where you're getting it
from Me personally, I like cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: derived CBD better personally because it
has you know, I Have a strain AC DC.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my favorite CBD to be honest,
and that's got THC in it So I mean I'm a
[SPEAKER_04]: fan But I'm more of a fan of THC
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives me more medicinal value Sure,
and I guess an extension of when you
[SPEAKER_00]: referenced Cannabis derived CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard a lot of discussion recently
around cannabis derived terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in reference to the vape
market where a lot of sort of Terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted from various fruits and other
natural sort of products can come into
[SPEAKER_00]: play or even synthetic terpenes Do you
take the time the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you take the same stance with that in
the cannabis derived terpenes are
[SPEAKER_00]: superior?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, if it's used for cannabis But I'm not
really a fan of putting other terpenes in
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis because we don't know you know,
like we do know that cannabis You know
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinally if you get limonene from
cannabis It's gonna be at a certain range
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not gonna you know But if you're
getting limonene from lemons and then you
[SPEAKER_04]: introduce that into a cannabis is that
safe?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really know So I wouldn't want to
say, you know Sure, and I guess a more
[SPEAKER_00]: focal point of discussion more recently
has been CRC which seems to have really
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of I don't even know what that is,
but it sounds like garbage Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's sort of like the The the
black resin you'd get out of the stem of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bong but it's the equivalent of what you
get out of like a dab rig sort of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's been a lot of Sort of I don't
want to say evolutions because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to promote it as a good term But
people have basically learned how to
[SPEAKER_00]: process this in such a way that it makes
it appear sort of more clean Do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's highlighting the idea that you
know people are going to any length to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a market like I can't help but feel
like this idea of people often push this
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of How you know, you got to just trap
hard to make a living Do you think this is
[SPEAKER_00]: like the next logical step of that where
people are literally polishing a turd?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't think there's a logical
Format in this but I do think it's a you
[SPEAKER_04]: know an avenue to make money and that
they're taking advantage of logic,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know I'm not a fan of turning shit
into good gold You know, that's not
[SPEAKER_04]: something that I've ever been a proponent
of you know, I'm like you get really
[SPEAKER_04]: high-end herb and then you can make really
High-end water hash with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of where I'm at, you know Yes,
I mean on that all these other avenues all
[SPEAKER_04]: these other avenues are out of my league,
you know So you you brought it up yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: water hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this your favorite sort of concentrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure hundred percent And why do you
think it is that we just have really seen
[SPEAKER_00]: a sharp falling off of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even amongst the connoisseurs we it's just
so hard to find Well people can't make it
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they don't have quality product to
start with so it's like if you don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: a quality product to start with You're not
gonna make quality product and it takes
[SPEAKER_04]: work and effort and love, you know And
that's something that's lacking in our
[SPEAKER_04]: industry these days, you know,
why not just like cut your weed down
[SPEAKER_04]: freeze it fresh Put a hydrocarbon to it
and make it make it make a wax or make a
[SPEAKER_04]: diamonds or make a whatever That's what
people think's cool, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just not people that know, you know,
I just I haven't found anyone yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's like oh man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd much rather have that BHO than this
like really high-end low temp slow pressed
[SPEAKER_04]: rosin or you know, some really good hash,
you know, I just haven't found that yet So
[SPEAKER_00]: something we haven't mentioned which I
wanted to ask you about was you referenced
[SPEAKER_00]: phylos earlier and I'm wondering do you
think that sort of the Scientific and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic testing is gonna lead the way in
terms of male selection going forward Or
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think that the breeders hunch is
still gonna reign supreme?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think intuition and plant relation
always run supreme Personally,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's just my opinion, you know I don't
think these squares that are like jumping
[SPEAKER_04]: into the labs and kind of gonna play over
Lord We're gonna do Jack, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean look at how look at how well I did
for him now, you know I think they let go
[SPEAKER_04]: of Mowgli, right and whatever and like,
you know, it's just a joke, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone it is what it is So I've seen on
your Instagram that you've worked with
[SPEAKER_00]: some tissue culturing facilities and I'm
just sort of wondering what sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: Improvements can we as a community hope to
achieve?
[SPEAKER_00]: From the utilization of this technology
long term.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's gonna It's gonna change the
industry heavily, you know because To
[SPEAKER_04]: offer that consistency across the board.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just can't do that and seed You just
can't you know, you can do that in tissue
[SPEAKER_04]: culture You can get acres and acres all to
be the same height You can get acres and
[SPEAKER_04]: acres to be pathogen pest free you can do
all that Stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the future in my opinion,
but you know because often we hear about
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and virus and things like that
Have you seen strains that have been able
[SPEAKER_00]: to be successfully cleaned with this
process?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not personally, but I when I had hoplite
and years back when I'm dark hard
[SPEAKER_04]: nurseries giving it out to everybody
before anyone knew what it was,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know I got it from them and then I it
took me two or three years to call out of
[SPEAKER_04]: my garden, you know And I just did it
through sight and through you know Knowing
[SPEAKER_04]: what to look for and I didn't even we
didn't even know it was called hoplite and
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, it wasn't called hoplite And
then it was not even called dudding then
[SPEAKER_04]: we didn't even know what the fuck it was,
you know Thought it was some like tobacco
[SPEAKER_04]: mosaic or something, you know So anyway,
yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I called it out of all my gardens
We don't have it in there anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did that just just personally,
you know, and How did how did you achieve
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I heard Bob Hemphill in the past
say that you can outgrow it Is that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of what you did like where you would yeah,
please explain so basically you take the
[SPEAKER_04]: best cuts and you Keep taking the best
cuts growing them in the best conditions
[SPEAKER_04]: and you you basically outgrow the hoplite
and you basically take new good cuts You
[SPEAKER_04]: propagate those you grow them out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take new good cuts and then you just
basically call it out, you know
[SPEAKER_04]: Eliminating anything, you know any time
any sign that I saw of that I would throw
[SPEAKER_04]: the soil pot and plant away completely
Yeah, wow, that's cool to hear that you
[SPEAKER_01]: were able to get rid of it Yeah,
I didn't even know what it was I just know
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like it So on to one of our final
questions before we jump into the
[SPEAKER_00]: fast-fire ones at the end I've been asking
a lot of guests recently if they have any
[SPEAKER_00]: concern about the possibility of there
being genetically modified cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically in the sense that Maybe it's
modified such that it grows at a very
[SPEAKER_00]: uniform height or the the levels are very
consistent In terms of cannabinoids so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it you know, it doesn't test hot or
there's at least consistency Do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something to fear?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really Honestly, I mean I Don't know
like in the industry I'm not fearing much
[SPEAKER_04]: in these kind of contexts because
everything's gonna play itself out I just
[SPEAKER_04]: so I guess that's that's something not
something I can really You know speak on
[SPEAKER_04]: too much to be honest, I don't think it's
something to worry about Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on to our final Quickfire questions,
which we love to ask all breeders to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of get their perspective on a few
different things The first question is
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the most memorable cannabis you've
ever consumed?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I had some Maui Waui when I was a
kid and man I was high for like seven
[SPEAKER_04]: hours as some hydro weed like grown from
Oregon, I think and I Don't know that put
[SPEAKER_04]: a high on me like nothing else really.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was interesting Other than that,
I don't have a lot of memorable Moments,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it was like the first time I
smoked chronic That was that Maui Waui is
[SPEAKER_00]: grown hydro, you know Yeah, that's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the other end of the spectrum Were
there ever a specific strain that comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: mind when maybe a lot of your friends or
colleagues?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just really hyped about it loving it
and then you finally got a chance to try
[SPEAKER_00]: it and you were left a bit unimpressed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh Yeah, that's happened a lot Honestly
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even fix.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even explain Definitely happened
quite a few times Sort of the more new
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff or the older stuff I'm both,
you know, I've had some land race stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: from people that I go man is so good And
then some of this newer things you're
[SPEAKER_04]: like, oh man, this is the best and you're
like nah But then you do you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like then I had some LA Kush cake that was
really good You know when I had some of
[SPEAKER_04]: this other strain that wasn't that good,
you know, so it's I think it's like Each
[SPEAKER_04]: person, you know each person each grower
all that it's all it all comes into play
[SPEAKER_00]: there Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's give a desert island situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna drop you off on a desert island
And you can cultivate three strains for
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which three are you gonna take with you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow Um, there was this big sir Holy strain
that was out of Eugene that I first
[SPEAKER_04]: started growing that I would take that one
I would take the purple Hindu Kush that I
[SPEAKER_03]: just got from sir Bob Hemphill and I would
also Good og or sour best should ever I
[SPEAKER_03]: think Those those three I'd probably be
good Honestly Nice a solid selection
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the other end of the spectrum Let's
just say you were gonna drop someone off
[SPEAKER_00]: to the island who you're not particularly
fond of and you get to choose Which three
[SPEAKER_00]: strains they're left with which ones are
you gonna give?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think I'd even if I wasn't fond of
them I'd probably want them to have the
[SPEAKER_04]: strains that I just picked because I'd
want them to evolve their mind You know,
[SPEAKER_04]: cuz maybe if I didn't I wasn't on them Cuz
they were like, you know the way they
[SPEAKER_04]: thought or something If I wanted to stick
someone with some bunk strains,
[SPEAKER_04]: basically Is that what you meant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to accept the diplomatic Give
them a blue dream and Blueberry Blue dream
[SPEAKER_06]: and uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: What would be another one?
[SPEAKER_04]: imitator pretendica strain purple punch
[SPEAKER_02]: Blackberry sorry, I like purple punch
better blackberry kush Blackberry kush was
[SPEAKER_02]: a good strain to stick someone you don't
like with There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so The final question for our
interview today If you could go back in
[SPEAKER_01]: time to any place anywhere in history and
collect some seeds, where would you go?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what would you collect?
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow Well, I'd have to go back in time to
you know, the Tibetan Plateau and try to
[SPEAKER_04]: like find some of those, um, you know root
Starter strains from way back thousands
[SPEAKER_04]: and thousands and thousands of years ago,
you know, that'd be one Wouldn't mind um,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know going to Nepal try to find
