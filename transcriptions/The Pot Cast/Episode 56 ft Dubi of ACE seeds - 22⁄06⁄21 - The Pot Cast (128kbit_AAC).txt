be joined by one of the land race legends
[SPEAKER_02]: of the scene, Doobie of Ace Genetics,
here to give us the rundown on all the
[SPEAKER_02]: different land race hybrids he's working
on, origins of different genetic lines,
[SPEAKER_02]: the culture in Europe, and so,
so, so much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are so excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without further delay, let's get into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hello and welcome to the next episode
of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are very lucky today as we are joined
by one of the land race legends and
[SPEAKER_02]: preservers of our scene, Doobie of Ace
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to have you here at the
podcast and to be with all your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, as I told you, my English is not
the best, but I hope you make me feel
[SPEAKER_00]: understand and I hope you enjoy the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are very humble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your English is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure people are still going to
enjoy it because you've been one of our
[SPEAKER_02]: most requested guests we've had for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: How does it feel to be so popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I never speak that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really touching to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first question we've been asking
our guests lately is, what are you
[SPEAKER_02]: currently smoking on?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, I have some New Caledonia
Airboots here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some CBD one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some a bit of Indica Airboot Cross
PCK and a few more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have Chinese, Cali China and yeah,
a few other Sativas.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really nice selection you have
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us a little bit about the New
Caledonia and that sounds very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new Sativa line that we worked on
last year and it has been released this
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from a grower through an
interchange, a swap of genetics I did with
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a very established grower there in
New Caledonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was interested also in our Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did an interchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me a lot of seeds from the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sativas he grew there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think we did the seed swap around
2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only at this time, I consider the seed
were getting too old.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was time to germinate them and
explore a bit the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that we work with land rates with
Sativas, he sent me a lot of seeds to work
[SPEAKER_00]: them and to refine the line and spread the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I didn't know what to expect at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly it was something really new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how we will link with other
genetics I'm more familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, we grew like last year,
like we still like 100 plants of the New
[SPEAKER_00]: Caledonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like three different seed lots,
two with more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the seed lot A and the seed lot B.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took like 50 seeds from each.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grew all of them together indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, initially the grill like really
tropical Sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very slow to reach the sexual maturity to
sow sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoors the grill really big, very big
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I was thinking that we had
something really, really tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we switched them to flower,
they also took their sweet time to really
[SPEAKER_00]: start to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they were indeed really tropical
or at least subtropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because New Caledonia is around 20 in
the south hemisphere latitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not really very close to the
equator, but it's subtropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, once the plants start to flower,
yeah, it was really tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took their sweet time to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found like maybe a third part of the
population was hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, this is very typical when you
explore new land races, especially Sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: land races from the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite common to find a lot of Hermes
in the first P1 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we eliminate the hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw some plants adapting better to
indoor growing, reacting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start to form resins, sowing terpenes
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had the chance to start to evaluate
which one were more promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started to eliminate the
hermaphrodite, we started to clone all the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of the plants that were sexually
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's quite common also with tropical
Sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that usually the female to male ratio
is very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you find maybe 78% of
females and the rest only males within
[SPEAKER_00]: these two also a lot of Hermes,
in this case a third part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, at the end we remove like half of
the plants after eliminate the Hermes and
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that after many, many, many,
many weeks didn't respond, didn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything or comparing with other world
lacking of resin of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, at the end we came out like with
30 plus really nice females and five
[SPEAKER_00]: sexually firm males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we open pollinate them with the
fine males, all the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, as I told you,
we had all clones from all these most more
[SPEAKER_00]: promising females in the mother room or
backup copies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, and then the reproduction was a
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pollinated all the more than 30 females
that were sexually firm.
[SPEAKER_00]: The males were sexually firms too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they finished the
reproduction, they were ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to evaluate better which one
were more resinous with better terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: although they were seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most promising ones, I brought
clones to auto-growing to do since Emilia
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means without pollination to evaluate
properly the flower without seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors, which is, I feel that this
strain express itself better outdoors than
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, at least in this initial
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, it was surprising because we move
the clones a bit late in August,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a bit late for planting even for
tropical Sativas, but they catch up very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The small clones grow up almost like two
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around late October, they were already
finishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe they will need one,
two weeks more, but they reacted outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: much faster and better than indoors.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, when they were starting
to ripe, my God, I was really excited
[SPEAKER_00]: because I start to smell like incredible
refined tutti frutti aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The resins were very good and normally
science in the plants we were testing
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our selection were in the right
direction regarding quality too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, at the end, we end up with
evaluating like eight females,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most promising females from the seed
reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We evaluate them outdoors without seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we start to smell them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought them to the lab for kind of,
you know, the Anthropen analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already did some genetic analysis a few
years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, with all the smoking test,
the growing experience, the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction, yeah, we decided we were
extremely excited about this new genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started to smoke it, I was,
wow, it has been so long that I don't feel
[SPEAKER_00]: this quality of high in a Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you smoke it and everything becomes
super clean, vivid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel like the colors more intense,
but not with distortion, like everything
[SPEAKER_00]: more alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sun also, you can hear even the
farthest sun super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you feel like a big energy growing up
from inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you become creative, connected with
your surroundings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel uplifted, motivated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your psyche is well-focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, very good quality high,
very, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest about the origins of the
genetics, I think it's not so linked
[SPEAKER_00]: directly with a land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the Finnish product has quite
a time type qualities in the smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: like especially in the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sour, lime, lemony taste that is
quite common on Thailand land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effect is quite Thai-like,
very clear up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the flower structure is more,
a bit more like Mexican or like American
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not so loose like the Thais.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Thais usually have a very loose,
very flower structure, very folk style,
[SPEAKER_00]: not dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: A real pure Thai is never dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one makes quite dense buds for a
pure Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trades, flowering structures that I have
seen more in certain Mexicans or even more
[SPEAKER_00]: modern Colombians.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, my feeling is somewhat like a
Thai-American, Sativa mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense to the audience regarding
the Finnish product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very interesting line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have released it this year and we
cannot wait to hear the opinion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and Sativa lowers about this new
line.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What an incredibly comprehensive and
detailed answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very excited to ask you some more
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is going to be a great
interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to know, you mentioned kind of
how you went about weeding out the
[SPEAKER_02]: hermaphrodites at first and sort of
stabilizing the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you get a land race line from seed,
do you find that you have to selectively
[SPEAKER_02]: breed out the hermaphrodisms or it just
over generations naturally stabilizes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, usually it depends how domesticated
is the land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, usually for example, if you get
seeds from a land race that has been
[SPEAKER_00]: refined and tamed very properly by a
grower, like taking very well care of the
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool and all the individuals involved
in every generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these cases, which are very rare,
you can expect lower hermaphrodite rates
[SPEAKER_00]: in these cases, in this land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the times the land races are
grown in mass field, like many plants
[SPEAKER_00]: every generation, whether it's in
Afghanistan, Pakistan or India or in
[SPEAKER_00]: Morocco or in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow many, many, many plants and not
all the farmers, not all the traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers are very diligent or very
efficient to remove, to fully remove their
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite traits in their population.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is for example, because usually in
has plant population, they don't mind all
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants are fully seeded, whether it's
in Morocco or Lebanese or Afghanistan or
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistan, the plants get completely fully
seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are not very worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the times they select,
they choose a good males that are sexually
[SPEAKER_00]: firm, but sometimes some male
hermaphrodites can escape and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: also pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, big populations of land race like
this usually have in some given plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: some hermaphrodite traits somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some land races it will be more
evident, in others not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, most of the times when we
receive the P1 generation, the P1
[SPEAKER_00]: generation is I refer to the first
generation seeds collected in situ in the
[SPEAKER_00]: place of origin of the land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually when I start to work with the P1
land race generation, it's very typical
[SPEAKER_00]: that I find a lot of hermaphrodites and
it's very common that I need to clean a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot the land race in this first
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some land race tend to be more or they're
lesser.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also most land race are auto genetics,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you bring them to indoor to
evaluate them, to select them and all
[SPEAKER_00]: this, the auto genetics that have been
grown for many, many generations,
[SPEAKER_00]: centuries outdoors, they don't really like
the indoor suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you put them indoor with artificial
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so stable photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they very easily show more
hermaphrodite traits that they will do
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors in their place of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a good thing because you force
the gen pool of the land race you are
[SPEAKER_00]: working with to show any problem,
any problem indoors, any kind of bad
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor adaptability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any army tendency, you can detect them
much easier indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I try to remove all the
hermaphrodite plants from the first
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only if I don't have enough plants to work
with, I will reproduce using maybe one
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly army, but it has never been the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually if I have enough plants,
I remove all the army and then focus only
[SPEAKER_00]: in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a stable I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for that answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that when you were talking about
all the different things you were smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: at the moment, you mentioned Oedipus or
however you pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very interesting strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I read online that it was sort of
worked on in Sweden maybe, and that it has
[SPEAKER_02]: like a strawberry flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us what you know about the
backstory?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quite interesting story.
[SPEAKER_00]: The report is a Nerber, which in German
means strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an Afghani, an Afghani clone that
was very widely grown in Switzerland
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Switzerland, they have like the golden
era of the Swiss cannabis time that was
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They legalized for a few years also the
THC cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was around that time when Breeder Steve
or Mr. Nice and other breeders went to
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland to legalize for a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing got out of control and then the
Swiss government stopped it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Switzerland was quite straight for
20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with all the CBD seen,
they are in a new golden era in
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland, but more with the CBD
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that time they were growing CBD,
sorry, THC psychoactive strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the clones, Afghani clones that
they work and grow a lot, it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: Erber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an Afghani that they used to grow
indoors in big indoor rooms to sell in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Swiss coffee shops at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a quite popular Afghani strain
in Switzerland like 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also at that time in Switzerland,
there was also a local seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was old seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Breeder was Felix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he used to grow outdoors in
Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a Swiss outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got a purple Swiss outdoor line
from some old ladies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that it was the Purpuria
titinensis, because it was grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: Ticino.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was purple, so it was called Purpuria
titinensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more sativa, hempy strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The origins of the Purpuria titinensis are
not clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say it could be an Himalayan
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not clear, but it was already an
outdoor strain that was very adapted to
[SPEAKER_00]: Swiss climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very early flowering, very resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the indoor Erber was crossed with
Purpuria titinensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it came out the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the airport came out, the golden era
of the Swiss TAC times ended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some Danish breeders like Esben and
Nospe work their poor genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three generations, they're in
Denmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Esben, which is a friend of mine,
is a great Breeder, a very kind person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage our audience to discover more
about his seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is hybrids from hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's specialized in breeding northern
lions for cold northern climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has many interesting semi
autoflowings strains that finish very well
[SPEAKER_00]: in Denmark, in northern Europe countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he passed me the airport after work
with the strain outdoor two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew the strain from him in 2006,
but he gave me the seeds to start to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with them in a more serious way in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2012, we start to work the strain
indoors, outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw some Aphrodite tendencies when we
brought the line indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I told you with the land
race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very typical.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take another line that have been
worked and selected many generations
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors, when you bring it indoors,
it's very typical that some parental
[SPEAKER_00]: plants give some Aphrodite problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we work the strain indoors a bit to try
to adapt the genetics indoors to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: this Aphrodite indoors, mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, one thing that was never done
with airport, the airport was already a
[SPEAKER_00]: very consistent line for airliness,
for cold resistance, for very beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The airport has like two main venues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The airport was a green Afghani and the
Purpuria tithinensis was a very colorful
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the mix between the green Elber Afghani
and the Purpuria tithinensis produced like
[SPEAKER_00]: a blend of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some leaning to the green airport,
so more green in color, and others leaning
[SPEAKER_00]: to the very colorful to the Purpuria
tithinensis with purple, red, black
[SPEAKER_00]: colors, and some phenotypes also in
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, the qualities of this line for
airliness, for cold resistance,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were clear and the taste is quite
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the colorful have a berry taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green Afghani phenotypes have a more
earthy, hashy taste, Afghani taste,
[SPEAKER_00]: very classic Afghani taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the terpenesia you can find
in the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being an Afghani line, you know
Afghani line don't really, they could be
[SPEAKER_00]: problematic with the bad rot in late
flowering, you know, because in
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan is a very dry climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the genetics from there are very
used to flower with very dry conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: with very strong temp variation,
but with low moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why a lot of the Indica Afghani
genetics are very susceptible or are very
[SPEAKER_00]: prone to bad rot, to botrytis also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and that was the case also with
airport, because it contains a heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: strong of Afghani genetics, both in
Denmark, that is a wet country,
[SPEAKER_00]: and here in my coastal climate,
although my climate here in Spain is very
[SPEAKER_00]: warm, but I have a lot of moisture because
I live very close to the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we found the airport a bit
problematic with the bad rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 2012, we work like maybe until now,
we have worked like maybe four generation
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors and three generation outdoor,
in regular and in feminized format.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through all these generations,
we brought samples to the lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we identified, no one did before,
that the airport also have CBD content,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's very typical from Afghani
Hasplan land-based population.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a topic that we can discuss later.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one knew this before, that airport,
whether it was a THC-rich strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was clearly psychoactive, so it had
THC, but we with our evaluation,
[SPEAKER_00]: work and study at the lab, we confirm
scientifically the airport was also a
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD-rich strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the phenotypes are a one-to-one
THC-CBD chemotype, balanced, usually with
[SPEAKER_00]: 7-8 THC to 7-8 to CBD, so quite balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets you high, it's not the most strong
indica, but it's not psychoactive,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets you quite high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, there are some, we found some
very rare phenotypes that only have CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: very little THC, but more or less it's
like a balanced THC-CBD strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: very early-flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good thing of the airport is that it
has the semi-autoflowering trait from the
[SPEAKER_00]: purpuriaticinensis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does semi-autoflowering mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a concept that is a bit confusing for
many.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's semi-autoflowering because it's not
fully autoflowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that you can keep clones in the
mother room, you can keep them for long
[SPEAKER_00]: periods, in turn, you can even try to
re-bake the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is completely impossible with fully
autoflowering genetics, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: But hormonally, they tend to flower at any
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, when they feel rot-bound,
they try to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they feel that there's just a slight
decrease of photoperiod outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: they try to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a very early-flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: onset outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When most of the Afghani indoor strain
start to flower in maybe in August,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my latitude, to finish in early
October, the airport maybe start in July
[SPEAKER_00]: and finish in late August, early
September.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the flower is 45, 50 days,
but it can start to flower one to one
[SPEAKER_00]: month and a half ahead than other Afghani
strains that have no semi-autoflowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an advantage for cold and for
an early harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is more or less the quality and
the history of the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have made some highways with them,
some with THC, some with CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, it's a very interesting plant by
itself for medical, because it has both
[SPEAKER_00]: THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very relaxing height and good for
pain, good for muscles, for insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, and it's also a very useful plant
for breathing for illness and for
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting chemotypes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of CBD, you also mentioned CBD1,
and I noticed you had made that more
[SPEAKER_02]: recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: What inspired you to make that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you want to do more CBD?
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD lines in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the CBD is honestly a very
interesting field.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you well know, we have had 10 years or
more like the CBD revolution, like people
[SPEAKER_00]: realizing of the medical benefit of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's now a complete boom in the
industry for CBD products, a total range
[SPEAKER_00]: of products, whether it's genetic seeds,
extraction, flower, edibles, for medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the national health systems,
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, when I started with this,
I'm not going to lie to you, I was more
[SPEAKER_00]: interested to get high on the recreational
side of the cannabis, like many people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, obviously I understand that not
all the people approach to cannabis from
[SPEAKER_00]: the recreational side, and some people
really need it as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also started to, last year, like a bit
of anxiety myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I felt like it was also a good
moment to focus more on breathing with
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, also for myself, but also for others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I saw that at least here in
Europe, in the United States, the thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: much more advanced, because with the
legalization and all the resources,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the qualified people they have there,
they have advanced a lot in the hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing, and to develop hemp lines with
CBD that are very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have done, and they are doing an
amazing job there in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here in Europe, the pioneers of the
movement, to put it in that way,
[SPEAKER_00]: that were Jaime from Resin Seeds,
here in Spain, yeah, curiously,
[SPEAKER_00]: the main lines, the main CBD lines that
came out to the scene, to the CBD game and
[SPEAKER_00]: the CBD breathing, that were more useful
and more appreciated by growers came from
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was from Jaime from Resin Seeds,
which was the first to identify in a DSL
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid CBD, and then they call it
Cannatonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won a Cannabis Cup here in Spain,
and then it got a lot of reputation after
[SPEAKER_00]: it won the cup, and after being analyzed
for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the origins of the Cannatonic
were not clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, we knew that it came from
another Spanish seed bank called Reggae
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds, that they were also working with
many, the DSL hybrids and Richard CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: DSL hybrids mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were the main source of the CBD
rich strains that later make the boom in
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe and later were brought to United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very interesting because they
taste like and look like the best DSL,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, DSL.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they contain a lot of CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so with this moment, Jaime created
the Resin Seeds offering some CBD strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jaime from Resin Seeds,
I think joined with Scott Blake from Santi
[SPEAKER_00]: Baba from Mr. Nice to make CBD Crewe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think CBD Crewe were giving CBD
breathing services to many other companies
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe, like Serious Seeds,
That's Passion, many others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, eventually many CBD strains came
out from all the seed banks, but all these
[SPEAKER_00]: strains didn't have the chemo type
stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very irregular in chemo type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when these seed banks were offering CBD
strains, but the chemo type was not
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, yes, you could have 50% of
balanced chemo type of THC CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% only CBD, and 25% THC with THC and no
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, this is from the medical
point of view, it is crazy because the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower don't know what's the chemo type on
his plants and he or she cannot tolerate
[SPEAKER_00]: well the THC and he or she got a THC plant
from so-called CBD seeds is not a good
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, at that moment people were
releasing CBD strains like nonstop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had a friend that used to work
for Jaime many years ago and he got some
[SPEAKER_00]: Kanatonic S1 seeds from the original clone
from Kanatonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got self-fed seeds of that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend got the seeds for many years and
he told me, Dubey, these seeds are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do something with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, okay, Jeremy, we will check it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he phoned me and he told me,
hey Luis, I think I have some interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: things from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was about to take a flight to take
holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, okay, you just give the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I come back from holidays,
we check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I came from holidays.
[SPEAKER_00]: We check out the plants and brought all
the samples of all the plants to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we realized scientifically that
the Kanatonic original clone that was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it had a balanced chemo type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, yeah, I cannot remember,
maybe eight to 10 THC, eight to 10 CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you self-feed and you grow the S1
seeds, okay, we found out all the main
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotypes in the S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And S1 seeds behave like an F2 for the
chemotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the S1 seeds, we found THC rich plants,
balanced THC CBD plants like the original
[SPEAKER_00]: Kanatonic clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we found also only high CBD
plants with very little THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: From one of them, we found one that was 27
CBD content, which is the plant that with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lab report, not that someone says that,
no, I have a 30% CBD plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you saw my analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an analysis that proves that the
Kanatonic S1 plant we selected,
[SPEAKER_00]: it contains 27% CBD analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around one THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have another system with a similar
chemotype that was 17, 18 CBD and 0.7 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the most interesting was the CBD
one, the one I tell you that had 27% CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other was CBD five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so very easy to say, okay,
we already have found from the Kanatonic
[SPEAKER_00]: population, the ones we want with the very
high CBD and low THC chemotype,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just need to cross the plants from the
Kanatonic S1 of the chemotype we want
[SPEAKER_00]: between each other to stabilize this
chemotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, the plants sound quite easy,
but unfortunately they were infertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a problem that sometimes you find
in S1, in S1 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: S1 self pollination is the highest form of
inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like having kids only with
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not other higher form of
inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You maybe could have kids with your
sister, it would be a very high form of
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding, but it's even highest
inbreeding to totally produce offspring
[SPEAKER_00]: with your genotype without introducing any
other genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a very interesting tool for
fixing traits for inbreeding in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: strong way, but it can also lead to health
problems like lack of vigor, mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the problems that some of the
S1 lines can show, not all of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: is infertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to pollinate CBD one with CBD
five reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to pollinate CBD five with CBD
one reversed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had like a wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't know how to advance in the
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, I say, okay, we have the
airport, which is also a CBD rich line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has not stabilized to be only CBD rich,
the airport, but it's another CBD rich
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD rich that is fertile and that we can
try to introduce to the infertile
[SPEAKER_00]: canatonic S1 plants that we cannot
reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it was still a bit
infertile, but we managed to do a cross
[SPEAKER_00]: between the CBD one and the green airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this F1 cross, it was the CBD cross
airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had like 50% the balance THC CBD
chemotypes like airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 50% only high CBD and low THC
chemotypes like the CBD one, canatonic S1,
[SPEAKER_00]: parental plant, we selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mix of terpenes and resins was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The canatonic has very nice terpenes from
the SOVDSL, terpenes resins, like skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: and all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very, very nice hybrid only for
terpenes, resins, bucket pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to focus only in the high CBD
plants, low THC from the CBD one airport
[SPEAKER_00]: cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: We selected the ones I like more,
the smoke and the love have the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: We selected four females of the F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we reverse again the CBD clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It produced very, very, very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we managed to pollinate these four
selected females of the F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So produce somewhat like a back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD one airport cross to CBD one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we grew this back cross, the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we found that all the seeds had
stabilized the chemotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: High CBD, low THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we did it and it was not very
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously you need help from the lab,
otherwise you are selecting numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: blindly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, the way to stabilize follows simple
Mendelian ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in the canatonic S1, it is split in
basic Mendelian ratios also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we did the F1 cross, we cut a bit
the chemotypes, but also the frequencies
[SPEAKER_00]: were very Mendelian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally we managed to stabilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought to the lab, we confirmed that
all the plants were like we wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we selected again the four that I
like more, the smoke and the have slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: more CBD than her sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we inbred each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't back cross again to the CBD one
clone because we wanted to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that we can came out with lot of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we use again the CBD one original
plant, it will lead us to very small
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction to the infertility so it will
be impossible to make a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: release.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we inbred the back cross of parental
plants that I like the most, reproduce
[SPEAKER_00]: between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inbred line, we were just inbreding
through the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some slight fertility problem,
but we really managed to produce thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: and thousands of seeds and finally release
the line with the chemotype stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So summing up, it takes the best from the
canatonic with a bit more of feliness from
[SPEAKER_00]: airports.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemotype, the best very chemotype of
the canatonic is stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the work we did that other
seed companies know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brilliant, brilliant story there taking us
through the whole creation process.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take me back to when you were younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was like a classic story like any
person could have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started smoking at the school around 14
years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, my history is quite normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it illustrate quite well how we grew
up, the cannabis scene and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry in the last 25 years,
because it was quite on hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here in Spain in the mid 90s,
we are very close to Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: The south of Spain is just a few
kilometers from north of Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plantations of Morocco is also in
the north, not exactly down to Spain,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's very, very, very close to
Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Morocco has been since the 80s,
like the biggest hash producer in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cannabis culture in Spain has been
until this new century has been always
[SPEAKER_00]: been hash, Moroccan hash, always,
always, always, always.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you get a bit of the picture
because here the hash, we have all kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cheap, very easy to access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yes, for us, it was the cannabis
culture in Spain, the Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, I started smoking Moroccan hash
like most Spanish did in the 90s or
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I love the creative effect,
the relaxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many, many friends love it,
also the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's countless, the great times and
memories, great memories I have from the
[SPEAKER_00]: childhood as a teenager around cannabis
and with my close friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's countless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a part of our life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grew up with it daily, daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of my close friends are really
passionate cannabis lovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really in our culture,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here in Spain it has been always quite
tolerated to smoke cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, the cannabis culture in Spain
regarding cannabis and specifically hash
[SPEAKER_00]: is very, very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, yeah, during my youth and teenagers,
what was available was mainly hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the good luck to experience in the
good time of Moroccan hash, all the good
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around 1996, 1997, here in Spain,
they start to appear the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: magazines and the first grow shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was really the revolution for the
homegrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because previously people didn't know how
to grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know anything about genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash was so cheap and so easy to
access that people just buy hash and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke, hash, cannabis in that form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very people grew and they grew very
badly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what it was, a female or a
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of myths, but there was not
good books.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were no good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, the people was strictly hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few hippies maybe traveled to India,
Nepal to buy some clothes, bring here and
[SPEAKER_00]: they go some marijuana there, grow the
seeds, grow here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or some people here in Spain, we have a
lot of contacts with the Latin American
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico, Colombia, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get seeds from Mexico, Colombia,
it was quite common to get seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: Morocco also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some hippies grew some genetics that
were from this place, mainly Mexican,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian, a bit of Moroccan, also some
Indian, Nepal, mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were Sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these genetics, they were grown very
badly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were reproduced with no criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have very funny effects because
they were Sativas and they have very funny
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with around 1996, 1998, with the
introduction of the magazines like
[SPEAKER_00]: Kanyamo, which is hemp in English,
and the first grow show that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: selling all the seeds, the lambs,
the fertilizer, the books with information
[SPEAKER_00]: about how to grow cannabis from books from
the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then people start to travel to Holland to
get seeds and all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the picture started to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hash continue to be the main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember in my case, I start to grow
my first seeds that I grew were Nepalese,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican, Colombian, and Moroccan,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first that genetics I grew was in the
96 and was a Hawaiian skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I harvest, my friends were tripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had never seen with such quality,
completely organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could harvest like half kilo.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are 16 years old, this is so much
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of buying and hash with your
parents' money and all this, then we say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, we may need to start to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, at the 16 year,
I was still living with my parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents didn't tolerate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was so passionate that they always
allow me to put some plants at home with
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, I always had plants at home,
always, always had plants at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I go to the university,
I go to live alone with my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I already have a few grows on my
shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew in 96, 97.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew like many good Dutch strains at
that time, 96, 97.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dutch seed bank were at the end of the
best time, the golden era of the Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding that it ended up on around 96,
97 when the Dutch government stopped the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They no longer can breed legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after 96, 97, the seed banks,
they still have a lot of good seed because
[SPEAKER_00]: they produce before it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this lasts until the new century,
a few years later, maybe 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during this year, we got very,
very nice genetics, the very best genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: from Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, we grew it with the
land races we were collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very interesting because in the
early days, me and my friends managed to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that we have very good climate
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow almost all kinds of tropical
sativa and all kinds of Dutch strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had the chance to compare the super
refined hybrid from the sensi seeds done
[SPEAKER_00]: by Neville that put a lot of work and a
lot of good job on them and then compare
[SPEAKER_00]: them with the land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you see something so refined,
so tame, the Dutch genetics and you see
[SPEAKER_00]: the land race so raw but with some very
unique traits, characteristics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, how to say, we appreciate both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the start, we appreciated both.
[SPEAKER_00]: The super refined hybrid from Holland and
the unique qualities that we were starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to find in the land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, and I asked to myself,
I will be able to breed something as good
[SPEAKER_00]: as the Dutch strains starting from land
races?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a question that arises the
early moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, if others did,
I'm sure I will be able to do it because
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end, all the super strainers we
have today, the Koosh, Oggy, Skank,
[SPEAKER_00]: they all came from land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously they have been refined for so
many generations that they are now very
[SPEAKER_00]: distant from the land races, but
everything started from the land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gives me another time,
the internet was not so widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was not so easy to get information
about land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was interested both in to know the
very, very best.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time it was in Holland because in
the mid-90s in California, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to legalize, but Holland was
still the main hub for genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like, and try to breed,
learn how to breed and try to come out,
[SPEAKER_00]: breed something really different and
unique from land races that I could call
[SPEAKER_00]: my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that hopefully is as good as the best
Dutch strain and American strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my expectation when I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more with the willing to learn,
not to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time it was more like a hobby,
more like a passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not any business involved,
not even expectation to have a business
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, an admirable goal to be trying
to improve on sort of those early strains
[SPEAKER_02]: that really paved the way for the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I was wondering, was this sort of
the moment when you thought I would like
[SPEAKER_02]: to start Ace Seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was it like when you first
started?
[SPEAKER_02]: What were some of the first projects you
were working on?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went to continue connecting with
the previous question, when I went to
[SPEAKER_00]: study at the university,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was not a big city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main grow shop, the owner hired me
to attend the growers, to go working on
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow shop, attending the growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, this was the biggest grow
shop in the whole province.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the growers, not only from the
city, but from the province came to the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow shop to ask about seeds, about
genetics, about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it was like I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot because now there are many
grow shops around and it's no longer the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that time, all the growers from the
province came to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I sell to them all the genetics and
they grow it and came back to me with
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, with clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I managed to get the incredible clones,
the best clones from the refined strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the best Jack Herrer, the best
Skanks, the best AK-47, Cali Mist,
[SPEAKER_00]: from Magus Genetics, the Warlock,
from Homegrown Genetics, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got everything, the very best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned a lot because all the
growers came to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot because at that time,
the information in 2000 was very short.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after working there for a few years,
I learned a lot and I get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of contacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was also the time that the internet
started, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some iconic old forums at
that time that were overgrown,
[SPEAKER_00]: was the main one, and Cannabis World,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: At that very early times of this 21st
century, the worldwide cannabis community
[SPEAKER_00]: that was on the internet, we were posting
and we were connecting mainly in Overgrow
[SPEAKER_00]: and also in Cannabis World.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a very beautiful moment because
it was the start of internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It managed to connect many, many growers
from all around the world that previously
[SPEAKER_00]: were all isolated, one in North
California, others in Europe, others in
[SPEAKER_00]: Latin America, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wow, that was like a wealth of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible, exchanging genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: People from countries where the land
raiser were produced also started to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect to these folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started to exchange land-raised
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from Spain, there were not many people
interested in land-raises, only a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was mainly me, Alex Manonegra.
[SPEAKER_00]: We was a breeder from Canary Islands in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Kaiki, Charlie Garcia,
I know him as Kaiki, from Cannabiohem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and then we all three met on the
forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really had the same passion for the
land-raises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were talking a few years,
exchanging seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was around 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Alex Manonegra came to live to my
city from Canary Island with his
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriend, his then girlfriend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I meet him in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kaiki was from Madrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had his company already there,
Cannabiohem, which was the first Spanish
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bank, the first Spanish seed bank
that was established.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all meet in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first years were very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all had the same passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had different characters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kaiki and Alex were one generation older
than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were around 50 plus around that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just in my 20 plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very young.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could be almost like my parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot from them because
obviously they have much more experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with me in life and with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very enriching experience both
regarding cannabis and friendship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we start to get in touch more in
person like in 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we start to work the idea to make
here in Spain like a seed bank working
[SPEAKER_00]: more with land-raises because it was our
main interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many people were doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here the seed bank that were appearing
were just interested in replicate the
[SPEAKER_00]: business model of the Dutch company and to
copy their genetics saying, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: why we don't, Black Domina are the
bestseller in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we take clones from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We feminize and we make a seed bank in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how many Spanish seed bank came
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to make something different
like the plants from Holland where it was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we wanted to do something different
from the scratch, from the land-raises to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand with different trades,
to came up with something different
[SPEAKER_00]: through the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, around 2005, the idea of creating
a seed was already more mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already have collaborators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kaiki had a few friends collaborating for
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my other friends in the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: I study, Alex had his friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the core of ACEDs, these early stage
was Alex Manonegra, Kaiki from Cannabio
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell and me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the pillars, the three
foundational person that created ACEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we came up with our first catalog
in 2005.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want, we can talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what were some of the first
projects that you were looking to release
[SPEAKER_02]: as a company?
[SPEAKER_00]: We were already a few years in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had some hybrids already in
progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we came out with the first catalog
in 2005, there were five strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: all in regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, we didn't offer feminized
seeds yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strains were, the first seeds are
quite famous and are still available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be considered ACEDs classics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are Bangui Hayes, Congo, Nepal Jam,
Orient Express, Panama, Antical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then four more that were only
available in very short supply in this
[SPEAKER_00]: first catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were Renata, which was a
Brazilian-Cambodian Hayes, Pursativa
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Guerrilla, which was a Nepalese
Kathmandu Cross Lesotho.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Manfaya Hayes, this was from Alex
Manonegra, which was Cape Verde,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mali, Nepalese Sativa, and Canela,
which was from Kaiki.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a North Indian Cross Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was our first 10 strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first six have been available for the
last 16 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bangui Hayes, Congo, Nepal Jam,
Orient Express, Panama, Antical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure our audience are more
familiarized with these ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think almost every strain you just
mentioned rings a bell, and I hope we can
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about them a little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to quickly ask you,
a lot of people were saying that Charlie
[SPEAKER_02]: Garcia from Canna Biogen used to work with
you at ACE.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was wondering what sort of projects
did you do together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the first release?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how come you guys decided to sort of
end that collaboration?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more of what each person could
offer to the project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alex Manonegra had a lot of experience
with African Sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lived in Canary Islands, which belongs
to Spain, but is an island that is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: far from Spain, very close to the African
continent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's closer to Senegal than to Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canary Islands is subtropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Hawaii, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can grow excellent Sativas there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil is volcanic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radiation is strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperatures are warm the whole year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still a bit of photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's even better than Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Congo, that there's no photoperiod at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the whole year exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had a lot of experience with African
land races, Sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew, I don't know, one of his most
famous was the Angolese red liamba.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also grew Sativas from Senegal,
from Mali, from Cape Verde, Congolese.
Mozambique.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the African expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kaiki, he was one of the founders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kaiki is the Charlie Garcia, the person
that you comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the founders of Cannabio
Hen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cannabio Hen, when they came out,
they already have a few strains that were
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very, very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kaiki was not new on the game,
to say in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: He already had lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has, with Cannabio Hen, they already
released the strains that were extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: good at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each of us contribute with what we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, when I was starting,
I was working with the Nepalese and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese and the Vietnam Black.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my contributions in the first catalog
were Orient Express, which is my first
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Vietnam Black cross China,
Yunnan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also to the Guerrilla hybrid,
which is Nepalese Kanmandu, the Nepalese
[SPEAKER_00]: Kanmandu I work with, with the Lesotho
from Cannabio Hen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Guerrilla is also a hybrid I
did with a Brazilian Bahia Sativa I had
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated with Cambodia Hayes from
Reeferman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other strains, for example,
the Bangui Hayes was a Congolese hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: that came out from Alex Manonegra.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very energetic Sativa hybrid with
Congolese genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is it was still a bit
longer flowing and the effect was great,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a colleague of Charlie Garcia,
of Kaiki.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot, this clone from Manonegra in
Greenwich.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end, he managed to pollinate
with, they told me it was a Nepalese,
[SPEAKER_00]: and managed to get some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this, they managed to,
used to breed in Galicia, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: north of Spain, is a very rainy part.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is colder, the weather is not very
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he managed to adapt this original
long-flowing Congolese hybrid to his
[SPEAKER_00]: colder climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a fast-flowing Sativa, he also adapted
to end up growing it, making it smaller,
[SPEAKER_00]: faster-flowing, 19 weeks, but still
capturing the hydration production and the
[SPEAKER_00]: very electric effect of the Congolese
hybrid from Manonegra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he stabilized it, changed a bit the
concept of the plant, making it
[SPEAKER_00]: faster-flowing, more cold resistant,
better adapt to end up growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: after free for generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came up with Bangui Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the name they give to the strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one was free to name his strains in
the way they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, Bangui Hayes started.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started from a Congolese hybrid from
Manonegra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he was worked by a friend of Kaiki.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years later, he was worked by Charlie
Garcia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since 2012, until now, I work the line
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, the history of the line,
if I tell you, is a bit long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have contributed each in different
stages and at different moments,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have the Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Congo was, it came up, Charlie Garcia
had a Congolese Sativa, not from
[SPEAKER_00]: Manonegra, from another person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he crossed it with the Chitral that
Kanavi O'Hen had.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made a Congolese-Pakistani-Chitral
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He worked here until after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to this Congolese-Pakistani-F2-F3
hybrid, I cannot remember it was the F3 at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlie Garcia introduced a new Congolese,
a fast-flowing Congolese from Alex
[SPEAKER_00]: Manonegra, which is the Bangui Congo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Congolese that has a shorter
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Congo was originally a hybrid that
was 75 Congolese and 25% Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, it was worked mainly with
genetics from Charlie Garcia and a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: from Manonegra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, it was very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not so electric like the Bangui
Hays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had a more warm, euphoric effect with a
bit more of body due to the Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the terpenes were more elaborated than
Bangui Hays.
[SPEAKER_00]: For both strains were mainly Congolese
strains, but both are quite different to
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later, I never understand why my
colleagues wanted to name Bangui Hays like
[SPEAKER_00]: Hays when Bangui Hays was not in Sensei or
didn't contain Hays at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or why they wanted to call Congo and not
Congo-Pakistan when the hybrid was
[SPEAKER_00]: originally a Congo-Pakistan hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was just a young man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not my strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone can name their strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they came up with this name until
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we had some people ask sort of about
that, but that answers a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering though, do you remember
much about what the Nepalese was like in
[SPEAKER_02]: its pure form?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you remember how it grew and what
it smelled like or not really?
[SPEAKER_00]: The stabilization of Bangui Hays was all
done by Stai, the colleague of Charlie
[SPEAKER_00]: Garcia, I told you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I asked a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not very, very, very,
very concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was not my strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very young at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to be, but the strain that
came out was really something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, to answer the question,
I don't know exactly what Nepalese strain
[SPEAKER_00]: go into the Bangui Hays and how it went.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a detail I escaped to my
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping I could ask you a little bit
about the different Thai strains you work
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had noticed many of them looked really
nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was interested in how you would say
the Mau Thai is a little different to
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe some of the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Thai strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as you know, the Thai is for the
Sativa lovers is one of the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa land race of all times regarding
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we started to investigate looking
for high quality pure Sativa land races
[SPEAKER_00]: from tropical origin, obviously,
the Thais were the ones that interest us
[SPEAKER_00]: the most in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, at the beginning, we had like
four to five Thais, like the Taiko Chan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we had the Mau Thai from Kanabiyo
Hen, that it was the one that was used by
[SPEAKER_00]: Kanabiyo Hen in the destroyer strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then lately, in the last decade,
I've been working with another from Chan
[SPEAKER_00]: Mai.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to grow another one that was
terrible in my early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was this car very early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few that was called Thai 79,
but I think it was a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one came from Australian grower
called 20 Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the feeling that was a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was fantastic, but not really
pure Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, the three Thais, the high quality
Thais that we have been working with since
[SPEAKER_00]: have been mainly the Ko Chan, the Mau Thai
from Kanabiyo Hen, and lately more the
[SPEAKER_00]: Taichan Mai.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see really a lot of similarities
between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you compare with other green
Vietnam or older Cambodian, is what I call
[SPEAKER_00]: the green Surasattiva archetype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find in the lowlands of Laos,
Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, a genotype of
[SPEAKER_00]: green Surasattiva that is spreading in all
these areas of these countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they share a lot of similar traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are green, even with colder temps,
they remain green.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a long flowering time,
usually four months or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a rich THC chemotype with zero
or with very little or no CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene profile is also very common in
the different strengths that belong to
[SPEAKER_00]: this archetype.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are woody, spicy, sour, lime,
lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effects are very cerebral,
not body effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more nervous, like could be the
Mau Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are pure joy, super clean,
over lifting, refreshing, good energy,
[SPEAKER_00]: good vibe, like it was like the Ko Chan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others are more in the middle,
like the Taichan Mai.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the three that we have been
working more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started first with the Mau Thai from
Kanabiyo Hen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlie García Kaike gave us a clone of a
male that he had of the pure Mau Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we at ACE have a lot of many crazy
Sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2008, with the help of a friend,
of a colleague, we put the pure Mau Thai
[SPEAKER_00]: male to pollinate all of our best Sativas,
the green haze, the purple haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Thai culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ko Chan, the pure Angola, the pure
Thamal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pure Vietnamese, Vietnam Black,
many interesting Sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next year we came up with
many interesting F1 Thai hybrids as
[SPEAKER_00]: limited edition that were green haze Thai,
purple haze Thai, Vietnam Black Thai,
[SPEAKER_00]: double Thai that was Ko Chan close to Mau
Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Angola Thai and Thamal Thai I think were,
and Vietnamese cross Thai were given
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly as freebies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Vietnam Black Thai was also released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, they were extremely good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were extremely good Sativa hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around 2015, I started to grow some
old Taichan Mai seeds I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made some hybrid with Kali Chaina.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came probably one of, it came out
Taichi, which is probably one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids I feel most proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's Taichan Mai cross Kali Chaina F4.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, these are the type we have been
working lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also similar plants like the green
Vietnamese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Northern Laos, the strains
are different, are more purple strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The effects are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to Philippines, the strains
are slightly different also.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Banda Aceh in North Sumatra,
the very famous Aceh goal is slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe the green Thai is what people
recognize more as Thai belongs to the
[SPEAKER_00]: green Sudestasian archetype I described
just now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, just a really detailed answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our listeners wanted to ask the
question, they're looking for a
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendation from you that's either a
Thai or a Thai hymen.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hybrid that's got that really sort of
archetypal, soaring nice Thai high,
[SPEAKER_02]: but something that's a little bit on the
shorter flowering side if possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Taichi.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Taichi is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to describe it is, it has the most
exotic, intense aromas from the Kali
[SPEAKER_00]: Chaina.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely intense, exotic,
like liver, roasted meat, intense hash
[SPEAKER_00]: with violet flowers, with tropical fruits,
mangoes, creamy, sweet and sour,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the taste of a Chinese restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super complete, the terpene profile
of a good Kali Chaina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when cross with the Taichi,
the Kali Chaina is my best Chinese hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Chinese indica, very fast
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I added a bit of Kali mist to reinforce
the intense aromas and a bit more sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on Kali Chaina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find the Kali Chaina does wonders
when cross with wood sativas because the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kali Chaina is not so, it has the very low
intense that many people is looking in
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa strain or in hashed strains,
but in an indica strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high is very positive, not a stone,
no intoxicating, no narcotic, like out
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the people have tried to cross,
to lower down and adapt the Thai genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: with Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a complete failure because
the sicko activity, they are completely
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are completely opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come out with a very potent
hybrid, but it will be a hybrid of hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, will have a type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Tai Chiang Mai for me is my best
success on capturing the sativa qualities
[SPEAKER_00]: and enhance the exotic sativa side with
the intense of the Kali Chaina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the positive sativa side and awareness
of the effect from the Kali Chaina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with all these qualities, making it
easy to flower indoors and in temperate
[SPEAKER_00]: latitudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my most successful is Tai Chi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another that people like a lot is Thai
Cross Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also very, very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same Tai Chiang Mai I use for
Tai Chi, but instead of crossing it with
[SPEAKER_00]: Kali Chaina F4, I cross it with my Panama
Goddess Elite F10, which is the best
[SPEAKER_00]: Panama I have seen after 20 years working
with Panama, 10th generation Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Thai Cross Panama is also,
you can find a lot of Thai qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Panama enhances the lemony,
Thai bouquet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they match very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Panama helps with a lot of gel,
but still keeping the 100% sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: No indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two are very, very nice for people
that want to grow Thai with the Thai
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities and don't wait more than three
months of flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: While we're on the topic of Thai,
I'll also quickly ask you, what were the
[SPEAKER_02]: different Thai mothers you used in the
Golden Tiger Cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first Golden Tiger, it came out with
the Miao Thai hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I commented you in previous question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Malawi Cross Miao Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it came out very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first version of Golden
Tiger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal with that hybrid was to,
yeah, to come up with something with a
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme potency of the Malawi,
but make it a bit more up from the Thai,
[SPEAKER_00]: more energetic, more cerebral because the
Malawi has a body stone that is incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came out very, very, very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came out quite well, but I was not
fully satisfied with the terpim profiles
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Malawi or the Golden Tiger first
version, which was Malawi mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old Malawi killer cross with a Miao Thai
male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a few years, I was working with a
double Thai, which was a Ko Chan cross to
[SPEAKER_00]: Miao Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pure Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I selected a female that I like a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I think the Golden Tiger can
be a remake instead of Malawi Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Thai Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of including one Thai,
including the two Thais of double Thai,
[SPEAKER_00]: because regarding pure Thai feel,
our best job was double Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Double Thai, F1 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something I've been able to
replicate again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Thai male is no longer alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yes, I wanted to do something
better with the Golden Tiger, making it
[SPEAKER_00]: more Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Improving the terpim profiles and putting,
bringing double Thai into Golden Tiger,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just the Miao Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I call Golden Tiger 2.0 is double
Thai, then cross with Malawi killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I have selected different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more Ko Chan, one more Miao Thai,
one more Malawis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lately I'm introducing the more Thai
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm inbred between them to produce Golden
Tiger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically double Thai with all
Malawi killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a powerhouse combo right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely going to come back and
we'll talk some more about some Malawi
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but I just wanted to finish on the
Thais by asking you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that you used to sell a strain
called Thai stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you still sell that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: And was that one, one we've already spoken
about or a different Thai?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a different type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was from Gypsy Nirvana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know Gypsy Nirvana?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in 2008, he made a trip to show
Stasia and brought back to three so the
[SPEAKER_00]: Stasia land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the Laos Prabang, Thai stick and
Camargo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time he had some problems with
the law in Philippines and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I held them to his partners in UK,
the one that had ICMAX, CITBOTIC and
[SPEAKER_00]: CITBAY to distribute through through H6.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Gypsy Nirvana collector of
these three strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Thai stick was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, I didn't find it as good as
all Thais.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was extremely long flowing,
super airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying it doesn't have potential,
but I prefer the Thais that we already
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the Gypsy style.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been wondering for a long time,
what is Zamaal like as a line itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get to Zamaal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get to try it pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you describe the high of the
Zamaal?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was thanks to Gypsy Nirvana that he
introduced the Zamaal to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: community because around 2000,
it was a strain that it was only known in
[SPEAKER_00]: Reunion Island by the French people living
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our audience that don't know about
Zamaal, Zamaal is an African land race
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that comes from Reunion Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reunion Island is a French colony that is
close to Mauritius Islands and Madagascar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very beautiful volcanic island,
isolated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the local people, not the French,
but the local indigenous African people
[SPEAKER_00]: from the island, used to grow very,
very strong, trippy, exotic sativas in the
[SPEAKER_00]: most isolated parts of the volcanoes in
Reunion Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the Zamaal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reunion is subtropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Zamaal is one of the trippiest
sativas in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it consistently more trippy than,
for example, Thais or Colombians.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some sativa lovers consider the old
Colombians and the old Thai like the very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very, very best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found Zamaals that are much more
trippy than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in our first early days.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, we didn't have much
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did some early Zamaal hybrids and
they were scary, trippy, almost like the
[SPEAKER_00]: closest psychedelic experience I have had
with cannabis, similar to LSD or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are also some Zamaal
sub-strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most trippy ones are the booty ones
that have the less pleasant terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the colorful ones,
which are very, very, very nervous,
[SPEAKER_00]: energetic, almost like cocaine,
lot of coffee type of hybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the mango carrot,
which is the fruity mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one I use for Zamaaldeleka.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cerebral, but it has a more kind and
warm effect than the others that are super
[SPEAKER_00]: trippy or too nervous or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mango carrot has the most refined
terpenes, the kinder and best focus,
[SPEAKER_00]: not so trippy, not so aggressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you ever going to release the really
nervous one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I want to smoke some weird that makes
me scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scary type is the purple Zamaal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we call the purple Zamaal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We selected a purple Zamaal mother like
five to six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have made a few hybrids with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a section on our website that is
called research and development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we list there the latest hybrids we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have made that, but we have not tested
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has not been officially released.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by looking at the research and
development section, you can take an idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of what we are working lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you can find some purple Zamaal
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also released Zamaal Bliss,
which was purple Zamaal cross Nepal jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a limited edition from two,
three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have released a few hybrids,
but like a few purple Zamaal hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as limited editions or with little
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done any big release with it
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but with the time will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And very recently, also this year,
we have released a Zamaal Delica Breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing, it includes five
different Zamaal lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the line is purple Zamaal cross
with Zamaal Delica, in which we include
[SPEAKER_00]: two different types of Zamaal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this purple Zamaal cross Zamaal Delica,
Zamaal Delica Breeders pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we're working on it slowly,
but doing things, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to look into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as a side question, I'm not sure if
you're aware, but that, just the term,
[SPEAKER_02]: the carrot pheno of the Zamaal Delica,
it has like a cult following.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you're aware you created
this, but a lot of people in search of the
[SPEAKER_02]: carrot terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the carrot terps, it can be found
in, not only in Zamaal, but in other
[SPEAKER_00]: African Sativalan races.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I found it in Mauritius,
I found it a bit in Angolis, I found it in
[SPEAKER_00]: Congolese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, but the most refined in the mango
carrot in the mother of Zamaal Delica.
[SPEAKER_00]: This clone, do you know Jared from Magus
Genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know him, but I've heard the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's already retired, he sold the company
to Simon of Serious Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when he was still running his company,
Magus Genetics, Jared is a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very kind person and we met at the fairs
or cannabis events and we had a very good
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also received some of the original
Zamaal seeds from Gipsy, but he was
[SPEAKER_00]: working, Magus was working more Dutch
strain like Warlock which was skunk
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani or others that had not the lights
or white widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he grew a bit of the Zamaal,
but it was not his style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And knowing that I was quite a Sativa man,
he sent me the clones from Holland to
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Courier Company, the first two times
they arrived completely rotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the third time they make it and I got
a very nice Zamaal clone that he selected
[SPEAKER_00]: also with the mango carrot terpins.
[SPEAKER_00]: It maybe was not so trippy and strong like
the ones we had, but the terpins and the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality was very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one I decided to use for Zamaal
Delica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zamaal Delica is this Zamaal mango carrot
that Jared from Magus Genetics gave me in
[SPEAKER_00]: clone four and I pollinated with Golden
Tiger F1 hybrid, the Golden Tiger first
[SPEAKER_00]: version.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's Zamaal, Malawi and Thai,
Zamaal Delica.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to ask you if you could give
us a little bit of the backstory on how
[SPEAKER_02]: you obtained your Malawi stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Malawi is probably our most famous
strain of the last decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite a mysterious strain because
when I was studying at the university,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was a small town.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more or less, I had a lot of friends
and we have a cycle where we sell a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, one grower had a clone of
Malawi that he said that it was incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful, this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then he gave to us and some friends that
were collaborating with me at AC at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was a very, very, very good
indoor grower and he grew the Malawi
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors and we couldn't believe what it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so sticky that you cannot ... I
don't like the greenness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always do it by hand so I can touch the
resins to be in contact with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Malawi, it was impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the hand completely black,
pieces of bud stick to your fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you made a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smoke like, yeah, oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have high tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can smoke a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: People smoke half joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see his face.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so many stories of strong smokers
with Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about them but it's
completely devastating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like maybe eight, 12 hours high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wake up still high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot move.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a panic attack and you want to go
to the hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fall asleep and you didn't know what
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very extreme effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very extreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it was what I call the old Malawi
killer clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I asked, where did this clone came
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Antonio.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a crazy grower that now is living in
Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was crazy with the Africans and this
and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malawi from Antonio was for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brought it to ... All the people that
try it say, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tried anything so strong in my
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the consensus from many.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes is very rude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was earthy, dusty, woody terpenes,
oily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing refined, not fruity,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rude in terpenes but if it was
so strong, so long lasting, so profound
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have never ... Only a few times in
my life I have seen something like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it gained a lot of popularity,
the Malawi clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started breeding with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then coming out with Golden Tiger,
with Amaldelica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I released the Malawi in 2012 because
we were growing this clone since 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 10 years, we only grow it but not much
into breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided that Malawi would be a really,
really interesting line to add to the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around 2012, with the last original seeds
I had that were siblings of the clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the old Malawi killer clone,
I reproduced them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to know other females, siblings of
the old Malawi killer that were not so
[SPEAKER_00]: strong but I found carotid types in
Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I call the fruity Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the Malawi Breeder Packs,
it's the only Malawi line that have good
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I reproduced the Malawi and it was
released in regular seeds in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later it became the feminized version.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was around 2014, two years later,
in the P3 generation, the grandsons and
[SPEAKER_00]: granddaughters of the old Malawi killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I found the new Malawi killer,
which is the second most important plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in my Malawi breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: With these two, I found also in the P3
generation, another fruity Malawi that
[SPEAKER_00]: remind me a lot of the fruity types I
found in the P1s that I couldn't preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: at that time, and a colorful Malawi in the
second generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the purple Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that were killer for effects was
the old Malawi killer and the new Malawi
[SPEAKER_00]: killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruity was nice, but just for
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purple was nice, but for colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winners for potency and gel were the
old killer and the new killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I start to breed the new killer into
the old killer to make the latest
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized bedding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure that I combine my strongest
Malawi killer phenotypes in a single fem
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: The growers can buy a three, five fem pack
and will get killer phenotypes that are
[SPEAKER_00]: outstanding just by germinating one,
two, three seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years later, Antonio, the source of
the genetics, came back to Spain from
[SPEAKER_00]: Japan.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lost during these years in Japan all
his genetic library and was very happy
[SPEAKER_00]: that I used to preserve his Malawi clone
form and that I have been working the line
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep the line healthy, not only as a
clone, but also as a seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give back to him the clones and the
seeds so he can work again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, he passed away two years
later of a heart attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's unfortunate to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Malawi, it has been one of the
most important strains in the last decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have created many, many good Malawi
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, many line Malawi PCK, Malawi
Pakistan, Malawi Cross Panama is
[SPEAKER_00]: excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Golden Tiger or Zambaldelica are very
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have many, many, many Malawi hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal with the Malawi hybrids was keep
the potency of the Malawi hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Malawi, sorry, of the Malawi
killer, but try to improve the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile of the Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, with the Pakistani,
that works great for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Panama is also very terpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the listeners was wondering,
what is the strongest land race you sell?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds to me like maybe that old
Malawi cross new Malawi might be that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just for clarity, what is the
strongest land race you sell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Malawi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malawi.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, another one of our listeners was
wondering, how rare is the purple Malawi
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very, very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I only found it in the second
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I selected one and I pollinated with the
purple Pakistan chitral, and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: created Violeta, which is like an improved
purple Pakistan version where the Malawi
[SPEAKER_00]: improves, the bigger, the yield,
the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keeping all the, consistently the
colors and the terpene profiles of the
[SPEAKER_00]: purple Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I noticed that some of your crosses are
regular and some are feminized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it made me wonder what sort of traits
or outcomes from a cross make you think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's better suited for feminized versus
regular?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the few seed banks that still offer
regular and fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the people is too extremist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have one side of the big seller seed
banks that they say, no, to sell well must
[SPEAKER_00]: be only fem, and they are right because
what people mostly want is feminized
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's other extremists that
say, no, no, true breeding, the real
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding is only regular with classic
males and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually the reality or the interesting
position is more in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed a line in regular and in
feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And moreover, these can complement each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem, for example, some people that
say only the regular breeding is the right
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no scientific evidence saying that
you cannot fully breed doing it only
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're breeding in the regular
way, you're including males, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you are breeding only with
feminized, only female plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that although you are breeding in
the same strain and even with similar
[SPEAKER_00]: parental plants, there are examples that
will create different lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when breeding, let's put an example,
calichina regular and calichina fem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calichina regular and calichina fem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you can continue with the calichina
regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you find some traits in the
regular and you continue with the
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized and you are more successful
enhancing and fixing other traits in the
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can take a male from the regular
line and pollinate the females or the
[SPEAKER_00]: female line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can combine the success you have
made in one of the branches of the
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can combine with your success on
the regular lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they complement each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to be so extremist,
so black and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, no, no, no, only regular seeds
is the only good breeding because
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise they become hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no scientific evidence that if you
breed with feminized breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lines become hermy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is if you breed using hermeparental
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you breed regular classic breeding
with female and males and you don't select
[SPEAKER_00]: well your males and your females,
you will breed regular lines that are
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a line is hermaphrodite,
it doesn't depend whether it's regular or
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the work and the genetics
and the work and selection of the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality, quality is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed excellent, mediocre,
and nasty regular lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same for the feminized lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can breed excellent quality,
feminized lines, normals, and terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: People mix things and they take absolutes
like it was a fact and it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you from my breeding experience,
first hand experience, that you can fully
[SPEAKER_00]: breed a line through feminized breeding
and only with females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it also with a regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do it both sides, you will have
more success, more expression,
[SPEAKER_00]: more genetic variability, more lines of
the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: In mid-long term, it's more successful for
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if you only do one regular or only a
cross into one, one, one, one,
[SPEAKER_00]: or only self itself, that's where the
problem creates.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you inbreath with different
parental lines in each inbreeding step,
[SPEAKER_00]: it creates different lines, regular,
feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You combine one with others.
[SPEAKER_00]: After three, four, five, six, seven
generations, you create a very big family
[SPEAKER_00]: with many different branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can combine the best parental
plants from different branches in mid-long
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: To avoid inbreeding depression after many
generations of inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's some awesome information
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to ask you, I see that you have
been working with the A5 haze and the C5
[SPEAKER_02]: haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been lucky enough to have tried both
of them and I really like the hive,
[SPEAKER_02]: the C5, but I feel like most people say
they prefer the A5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one do you prefer?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's your thoughts on the two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very glad you had the chance to smoke
both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was just going to say I was lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to try them when I was hanging out
with Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you may know the story behind,
but maybe we can comment about it to put a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit in context or audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, as you know, Neville, in the late
80s, he made the first legal seed bank of
[SPEAKER_00]: the world in Holland called the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moreover, he was a very, very talented
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, he managed to get excellent
lines from some school man to breed with
[SPEAKER_00]: him legally for the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got the haze and the skank and dulvans,
an Afghani one from some skunk man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also liked to work a lot with other
Indica strains, the Northern Lights and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Hasplan and the GD13.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Matolis from Wilson.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were basically the Indicas he liked
most and the Sativa that he liked most,
[SPEAKER_00]: the haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Neville was also the thought is,
credit where it's due.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, without some skunk man,
we won't have the skunk revolution that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened in Holland or the haze revolution
that happened worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's true that Neville was the one
that, through the seed bank, made a spread
[SPEAKER_00]: and made the name of the haze really big
and well known worldwide with his haze
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, Neville didn't have much
haze plants from the original stock from
[SPEAKER_00]: some skunk man to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: He only had one super, I think he had two
females, one that was bitterly flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: and he thought it was a cross and he
avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: One ultra long flowering female that I
think he called the B-female that was so
[SPEAKER_00]: ultra long flowering, I think he was not
used to, and he avoid that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think he later rejected of that
movement of kill that plant because
[SPEAKER_00]: probably the worst fire in that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he ended up having only two males,
the male A and the male C.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I told you, when I was a kid,
I smoked a lot of hybrids from Sensi seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from all the Neville work because Sensi
seed bought the seed back from Neville and
[SPEAKER_00]: many seed banks were using the haze
hybrids from Neville to develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, I smoked the very best from
Neville, even in Holland, the Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_00]: haze, the Mexican haze, the Yajera,
the Northern Lax haze, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years back, Neville developed some
haze hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most famous is Northern Lax haze and
Super Silver haze or Yajera later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he also had some other direct hybrids
F1 haze hybrids that are not so famous
[SPEAKER_00]: like the Northern Lax haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the Hasplan haze, the G13 haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Neville haze and two Northern Lax
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was Northern Lax 5 clone pollinated
with haze male A and the other was
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lax 5 haze, no sorry,
Northern Lax 5 clone pollinated with haze
[SPEAKER_00]: C male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, he also lost the male A very early
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he never released commercially the
Northern Lax 5 crossed with haze A.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this one is the one that produced the
louder incense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very low incense that a lot of people
in Holland relates to to the best haze,
[SPEAKER_00]: came from the A dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The C dad, for I have experience in the
clones you command that you also have
[SPEAKER_00]: small, Jordi, I think is more a tie-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes are more lime lemony and the
effect is more uplifting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crossed with Northern Lax is still quite
dirty to my taste, but it's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville gave to some growers in the south
of Holland some selected clones of his
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite haze hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the A5 haze, the C5 haze,
the mother of Jajera and super silver
[SPEAKER_00]: haze, the one you smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hasplan haze crossed with haze C male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Neville haze, which is A5 haze crossed
to haze C male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the G13, which was G13 crossed with
haze A male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after smoking the plants from Holland,
and now which I know, which are descendant
[SPEAKER_00]: from the haze A male and the haze C,
I can really appreciate the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes signature of the C male,
the terpenes signature of the A male.
[SPEAKER_00]: The A male is, people was confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: The A male is more intense and the intense
comes from the American sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the A male is more Colombian or maybe
Colombian Mexican, but American sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The C male, although some schools say that
original haze never had a Thai that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: all Colombian, it's indeed Thai like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying the haze C male is original
haze crossed with Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be because in later generation
of original haze, some school man also did
[SPEAKER_00]: some haze Thai hybrids, Indian haze
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I qualify the haze C male and it's off
spring as Thai like.
[SPEAKER_00]: No Thai dominant because I don't have the
proof that is Thai, but it's very Thai
[SPEAKER_00]: like in terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the good thing is that I was in touch
with Yosami, was part of the member of
[SPEAKER_00]: this group of people from South Holland
that have been preserving the haze hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: from Neville for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville lost them when he left Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they share many with us and we have
been introducing, for me it's like a dream
[SPEAKER_00]: come true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to have the parental plans that
Neville used to develop the super hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: that changed my life and that had such an
impact over me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to have them now in my library of
genetics and to be able to combine with my
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa because I don't want to inbreed or
try to replicate the Aheller or something
[SPEAKER_00]: that hasn't been already done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with what I can contribute in this
field is more like to cross the haze
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid from Neville with my own different
sativas and try to bring it to a more
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa direction and with different sativa
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it my friends.
