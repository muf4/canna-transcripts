[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the chem dog, genetics,
the future of legalization, what you can
[SPEAKER_00]: expect from him, so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Need I say any more, guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, gang, we're back for another
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode, we have the legend behind
Lucky Dog Seed Co., the Chem 91 King
[SPEAKER_00]: himself, SkunkVA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to see you, and what a great
venue to be filming this episode at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are at the Lucky Dog Dispensary in
Montana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a bit about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did this happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky Dog Cannabis kind of was
conceptualized a long, long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this particular version of it is,
we started here in February of 21,
[SPEAKER_02]: right after COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: COVID actually prevented us from getting a
lot of the licensing requirements like the
[SPEAKER_02]: inspection and just a lot of the paperwork
that has to be done here in Montana,
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful Montana, Bozeman.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I made a big move from Sonoma County to
here, to kind of make this happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just want to be in the legal space,
the legal cannabis space, just because I
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like in the future, it's going to be
absolutely necessary to be part of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis in the future to have a licensed
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the first question that jumps to
mind is, how would you compare Montana to
[SPEAKER_00]: California in terms of the scene and maybe
some of the legalities?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Montana is a reddish-purplish state,
and they have an interesting population
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I fit in very well here because
freedom is big here, not just in word,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in action.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that it motivates me and
inspires me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always going to have my heart in
California, of course, the Bay Area is
[SPEAKER_02]: where I kind of grew up after I left
Virginia and Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tour was over, raised my family
there, my daughter there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The climate's changed there a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then cannabis has changed a lot there
because it's very difficult for a small
[SPEAKER_02]: operator like myself to function there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The regulation loop hurdles, the obstacles
of distribution, and it just didn't work
[SPEAKER_02]: out for me there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how I got here is a long story.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get into that some other time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the way it's different here is I
would say that the consumer here is more
[SPEAKER_02]: geared, at least my customers that come
here, are more geared towards older
[SPEAKER_02]: school.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're interested in what they had in
high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was surprised to find out that even
though there's only a million people in
[SPEAKER_02]: Montana, it seems like everybody here
consumes cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have the opportunity to talk
directly to my customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it was something that I had to let
go of when I was in my early 20s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turkey bags on beds, suitcases and duffel
bags full of cush and sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were going far, far places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've learned here that I've gotten back
in touch with the consumer directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It inspires me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to be around the joy that cannabis
brings people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people are just trying to make
$100 here and there, there's no joy in
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the way you survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you are able to show a consumer
71 different options of strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have 44 in the display case right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can find and talk to them and
find what they want based on what they've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I've noticed is a lot of folks,
young and old, they kind of go back to
[SPEAKER_02]: what they remember, what they fell in love
with when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have plenty of options for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the new and the old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as the regulations go,
I never really did it in California,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I was close enough to see how
difficult it was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And although I don't really do well with
regulations in general, I have found that
[SPEAKER_02]: I can adapt.
[SPEAKER_02]: To what is asked of me here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly just a bunch of letting go of,
you know, that's fucking stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to bend to the will of the man,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that info.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to dive into some of the
strains you have on offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the first thing I'd be interested
in knowing is for anyone listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: this, there's basically every clone only
you've ever drooled over in this display
[SPEAKER_00]: case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is, do you feel like your
customers are aware of how spoiled they
[SPEAKER_00]: are in terms of they've got basically like
the top 41 most in demand clone onlys at
[SPEAKER_00]: their fingertips?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think most of them realize this?
[SPEAKER_02]: They do have a slight view of it when they
come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, my perception is just between
me and my customers, between my customer
[SPEAKER_02]: and another company, a flower shop or what
have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really have that perception.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I do know is that when folks come
in, they, I, you know, I, with a few
[SPEAKER_02]: questions, because I love cannabis too,
I can kind of narrow down where we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a lot of fun for me because we're
both discovering new things together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have customers that come in
here, hang out and talk about,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, purely what they're looking at
and what, what they've experienced for 20,
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 minutes, you know, and I'll spend every
minute with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually they're the ones that are
trying to get away from me because I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: leveling or mind with cannabinoid and
terpene and brain chemistry information
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, trying to explain to them
that THC percentages don't really matter
[SPEAKER_02]: that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why don't they matter?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I love it because it's given me the
opportunity to kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: re-educate a cannabis user as to what we
now know about cannabis and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: why we all love different things and,
you know, why we're drawn, why,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the individuals are drawn to
different things, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like a discovery for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that it's mostly,
you know, the thing I've noticed about my
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers that come in is that they want
to try everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a winery.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to go through the flight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it's going to take you a couple
of weeks because we have so much,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, you know, we will get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll go from A to B and down to C,
D, E and F.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we got it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my favorite comment when I show
someone and let them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: take in the aroma is, man, that smells
like high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, that's the one for you then,
because I know exactly what you mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the analogy of taking them on a
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be interested to know what has
unexpectedly caught you off guard as
[SPEAKER_00]: popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any strains that you thought
maybe, you know, they're too strong for
[SPEAKER_00]: most people or just you didn't think it
was going to be a crowd favorite,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's turned out to be like a really
big hit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would say that the answer to that
would be not necessarily new strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: but strains that have been with us for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Durban poison comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's never really been a popular strain,
you know, so to speak, in all my circles
[SPEAKER_02]: in life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But up here, they really do like that,
you know, jet fuel, you know, energetic
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've learned a lot about what people
like by being here because, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you make assumptions, you know,
about what you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what someone else may like based on
those assumptions of what you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've learned that that's definitely
not the case, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten reintroduced to that fact that
it's just not the case, that you just
[SPEAKER_02]: never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to take the time with someone
and go through it with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, luckily for us,
even though we have probably more strains
[SPEAKER_02]: on the table than anyone else in this
beautiful state, you know, I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting these for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, things that I held on to
that weren't never really popular are very
[SPEAKER_02]: popular here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been a big surprise for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you know, a pleasant surprise,
you know, because we could talk Kim all
[SPEAKER_02]: day long, but there's so many different
things, you know, and those folks,
[SPEAKER_02]: they try Kim and people come in and
they're very frank with me about why they
[SPEAKER_02]: use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just it's a treasure to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's rewarding again,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look, I've got to tie it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this has to be one of probably
the only places you can get verified Kim
[SPEAKER_00]: 91 flower to purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: What to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What conditions do you feel Kim 91 works
best for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And have you ever had any customers sort
of do the fabled story of taking some
[SPEAKER_00]: home, consuming it, becoming a bit
uncomfortably numb, a little too strong or
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortably high?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, no, I I've been surprised on the
level of consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least in my experience with these
customers, I'm always blown away by,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you know, like their tolerance
and like how much they know they like
[SPEAKER_02]: powerful cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have many people come to the store
and say, hey, give me, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you have something that's just not that
strong?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a that's a thing out there,
but I don't get a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way I do it here and the way we do
it here is that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously we all agree that, you know,
most of us agree that the Indica tea with,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, nomenclature is not really
accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's got a purpose to it,
but it's just not accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to steer people away from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try to find out, you know,
what when do they like to smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do they like to smoke in the
morning or do they like to smoke in the
[SPEAKER_02]: daytime?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they like to smoke any time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they like to smoke nighttime?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that helps us narrow it down to what
we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's some some folks come in and
they're they're clearly looking for relief
[SPEAKER_02]: of an ailment that's happened still.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that makes it even easier when it's
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sleep, stress, you know,
my body hurts, those types of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just ask some questions,
you know, and we narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I've noticed, you know,
when I first started doing this and
[SPEAKER_02]: selling to the public, I kind of,
you know, felt like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to be quick with these folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found out that it wasn't really the
case.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want me to spend the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want us here at Lucky Dog Cannabis to
spend the time with them, to help them
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what they're going to be
consuming, why, you know, what.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, when they come back,
I mean, my customers are like my family
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like we talk about our lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pick up where we left off last week,
if that's the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting to know them allows me to,
you know, kind of pinpoint, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe you want to try this, you know,
maybe you want to stay away from this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this one's going to give you too
much anxiety, possibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe this one's going to make you too
sleepy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not, I know that's not what you
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go golfing with your buddies
or whatever, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I just, I don't think that,
you know, if I had, if it was a much
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger company, I don't think that we
would be able to have that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: personalized service.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as like the Chem 91 goes,
you know, I always tell folks that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: basically good for any time, anything you
want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, I mean, you know, to be honest,
I say especially at four in the morning
[SPEAKER_02]: after a long night, you know, with,
you know, say a bright and vibrant
[SPEAKER_02]: psychedelic experience and the sun's
coming up, there's no better time to
[SPEAKER_02]: consume Chem 91 than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can get up in the morning and
smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can smoke it all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's medicinal, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're hungry, it's certainly going to
help you with that, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's an anytime herb here,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've, in the past, you know,
I've always said that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe this is the more narcotic more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when I get other people's
experience, and that's a key point,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that my experience is one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my brain chemistry, but everyone
else has different brain chemistries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I always make sure to get the
feedback from them because I learn more
[SPEAKER_02]: from them than they learn from me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But their different experience than mine,
you know, enlightens me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that allows me to kind of reflect
on it and to share that with the next
[SPEAKER_02]: customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I would say the Chem 91
experience, you know, a lot of people come
[SPEAKER_02]: here just to have the Chem 91 or the
CrossRoot Chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've heard about it and this is their
chance to try it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this would be the place to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, we have a lot of tourism
here in Montana.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have had a lot of people come from out
of town, search us out, and then come and
[SPEAKER_02]: try Real Chem Dog 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds, in general, like the Montana
clientele base or the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: patrons of the business are more educated
and sort of interested in finding out a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more, as you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of curiosity, do you still find there
are still a lot of those same trends you
[SPEAKER_00]: see in California?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I guess maybe a way to distill it
down is, is cookies still pervasive in
[SPEAKER_00]: Montana, for example?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't be able to answer that
accurately because my perception is not,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't include that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't really get, you know,
and I don't think, I can't say this is,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is, you know, something that would be
across the board here in Montana.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my experience is, you know,
folks don't really come in here looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for the strain they heard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some of those strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been surprised that, how very
little I, you know, sell to a consumer of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It surprised me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Gelato 41, for instance, you know,
I think it's tremendous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I offer it to people oftentimes and they
usually don't even want to look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not, I can't really tell you why.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've sensed that they've tried it
somewhere else, maybe, and that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that they already had decided that it's
not for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really have any cookies strains
here, as far as I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have Tropcherry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't know how these are
really related to that, but they,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my mind, they're kind of a part of that
group.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, of course we have the Tits.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the shit by Deepak Genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Grandpa, I think he goes by.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does have the OGKB in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one's been moderately popular,
maybe not as popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think it's quite on that level
with the consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the people come in, they've heard
of older school strains that we have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, or they've maybe heard,
you know, me talking about it in the past
[SPEAKER_02]: and wanted to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have, you know, lots of
clonolase that everyone's heard of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but we don't have a lot of that kind
of stuff and we don't get asked about it a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's kind of,
that's all I got on that really.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit of a weird perception I
got because of what we do have,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you made me sort of remember one of
the Patreon submitted questions we got,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was that on a recent episode,
we were speaking to Tom Hill and he sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of said that it was a bit unexpected that
he tried to sample a Gelato 33 and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of our Patreon listeners was
wondering, are there any other modern
[SPEAKER_00]: strains besides maybe the Gelato 41 you
just mentioned that sort of caught you off
[SPEAKER_00]: guard a bit and you are interested in or
fond of, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have a lot of things that are
new to me, you could say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if anything caught me off
surprise like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm kind of particular about
what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like the skunk dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of new to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's in the same realm as everything
else that I, you know, love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and I do have a good cut of Wedding
Crasher, a Fino that my partner selected,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was kind enough to share with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one has been surprising to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that would be one that I
could, you know, say would answer that
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is like, it's a melody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's any time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm almost, I'm 49 years old and I,
you know, cannabis now, that's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like smooth, easy, you know,
I don't need like the big heavy whack me
[SPEAKER_02]: in the top of the head experience anymore
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want, you know, something that
tastes good and makes me feel relaxed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that was a surprise to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a new one to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Symbiotic Genetics, I believe,
created that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this Fino here is the best I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad to have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I often, you know, take less
experienced smokers or older folks who are
[SPEAKER_02]: delving into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of guide them to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say, you know, it's got a nice grape
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't, you know, complain about the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not a big commitment when you
smoke, which I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to be careful, you know,
like not everybody who comes to the door
[SPEAKER_02]: wants, you know, the strongest weed you
got, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that one is, I think that would be
one that was a surprise to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't expecting to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're on the topic, what have you
been smoking on lately?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the sort of things, if I asked you
at the end of the day, what have you been
[SPEAKER_00]: puffing on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What things are your go-to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the wedding crashers are a good one
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always smoking on tits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do like the red Lebanese hash
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my go-to at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my nighttime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like, I have a lot of, you know,
body pains, you know, when I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working my whole life, doing too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have some body pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to, I tend to always fall
towards the endicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, you know, I try to have a little
bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to try a little different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been pleasantly surprised with,
um, let's see, what are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I love the Durban Thai high
flyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be my daytime thing,
but Crossroad Chem is still my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it sounds kind of cuckoo cause
I made it, but I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like weed that's perfectly right down
the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like hybrids that are perfectly right
down the middle anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one hits that box big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could smoke anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to get you happier and
more relaxed and more, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: engaged in what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if you're going to the
bank, if you're taking the kids to the
[SPEAKER_02]: park, if you're walking your dog,
it's good for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always my go-to and it's my most
popular stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just mentioned the Durban Thai
high flyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you, because you find that
with a lot of breeders, they tend to sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of stick to one lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe they're more into Indica's and
they just sort of do Indica stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you do tend to with both within your
dispensary and within your seeds offer a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a mix of Sativa and Indica
offerings.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, in your opinion, is your most Sativa
seed offering?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed offering?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it probably would be, um, I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a toss up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the Chaska is probably the most
Sativa like, uh, strand that I offer in
[SPEAKER_02]: seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I would say that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that, but the Chaska,
um, you know, we've done the Russell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I would, I would also add to the
chem flyer that what I liked about the
[SPEAKER_02]: chem flyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not really, you know, I probably
have less experience with pure Sativas,
[SPEAKER_02]: as you say, than most people you talk to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just wasn't my lane when I was young.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was younger, but I think as most
cannabis users who, you know, or as we're
[SPEAKER_02]: aging, we find out that this changes over
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have really fallen in love with a
nice Sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the, the, the, the lack of
appetite.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the energetic part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I didn't like when I was younger was
the anxiety it brought on to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would say that the chem flyer,
the cross I made with the Durban tie high
[SPEAKER_02]: flyer cross with the chem 91 BX three
male.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's got that for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gives me the energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wakes me up and once it's great with
coffee, I want to go out and do stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I never feel jittery.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel my heart racing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like all these things that I
don't like about that type of herb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that sharp pineapple flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, who doesn't love that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't say it's fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't say it's gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sharp, you know, astringent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as I don't get like caught up
in too much thought, crippled with too
[SPEAKER_02]: much thought, or, you know, just anxiety,
borderline, I find that to be really
[SPEAKER_02]: uncomfortable for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the chem flyer and the
Russell, but the Chaska is definitely the
[SPEAKER_02]: most, whoa, you know, energetic,
you know, for I've had a lot of chem fuego
[SPEAKER_02]: Finos over the, over the course of testing
those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave me that, that, that experience
where I felt inspired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Creative, you know, energetic,
the things that I think people describe
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa with, but without the jittery,
you know, and I don't like the apt type.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the, you know, the chem dog
makes me extremely hungry, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't really care for that,
you know, cause I'm kind of, I succumb to
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really fight that off,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I like about the sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sativas are new to me in a sense,
I would say relatively new to me and my
[SPEAKER_02]: perception than most folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really enjoying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad that I'm discovering it at this
point in my life, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I too am just getting more and more into
sativas as each day goes by.
[SPEAKER_00]: So piggybacking on that thought,
tell me a little bit about the Russell
[SPEAKER_00]: because it uses a Jack Harrah BX2 female.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I guess the questions that come to
mind are what cutting did you use
[SPEAKER_00]: initially?
[SPEAKER_00]: What male did you pair to it to start the
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: And were there anything specifically you
wanted to improve on that Jack Harrah
[SPEAKER_00]: clone, I guess?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Jack Harrah is, you know,
a legendary cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that not just lemon, but the lime
flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that makes it unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a lot of grains that have
that lemon citrusy flavor and aroma.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the Jack Harrah is unique
because it has that lime as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a multi-layered citrus,
a stringent citrus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said before, when I started working
with that cut and messing around with
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going to come next, what I noticed
was that the figure wasn't the best on
[SPEAKER_02]: that cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least in that moment, it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing the Jack Harrah for a
while and it's actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I get big yields out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I just didn't have it dialed in,
but what I felt was that the production
[SPEAKER_02]: was a little on the weaker side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to improve that, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did use the BX2 in the first out
cross, and then I crossed it back and made
[SPEAKER_02]: the BX2, the Jack Harrah BX2.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal was to keep the turps,
keep that lemon lime flavor, keep,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course, keep that, you know,
high powered sativa feeling that you,
[SPEAKER_02]: many of us feel when they smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted bigger yields, more bigger,
which is, you know, at the very top of my
[SPEAKER_02]: list.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's one of the higher parts
of, you know, character traits that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: always breeding for is bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want the end user to have the experience
of like, look what I did over here with
[SPEAKER_02]: this particular plant, you know,
because I know what it feels like and I
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you know, when you're a
home grower and you've got a 10 or a small
[SPEAKER_02]: grow, you maybe, and this is changing,
of course, but maybe your environment's
[SPEAKER_02]: not 100% perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's difficult for you to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you live in a state where it's very
difficult to create the perfect
[SPEAKER_02]: environment just for safety reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm always thinking about that
human, that man or that woman.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I want them to have the
experience of like success, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that they pulled something off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that, when you're growing
cannabis, I think that's one of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: rewarding parts of it is that,
wow, look what I can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do this, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, why I like that is
because I feel like that translates into
[SPEAKER_02]: other parts of your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can empower yourself with
all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You find out that you've been paying other
people to do for you and now you can do
[SPEAKER_02]: this, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what makes life better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I want my customers to have that
experience and I'm trying always to let
[SPEAKER_02]: them have that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to facilitate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why I decided to make the
BX2 instead of the Jack Herrera just in
[SPEAKER_02]: the cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to see if I can get more vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like we did and we kept the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kept the essential experience of the
Jack Herrera and then we just added some
[SPEAKER_02]: punch to it with the Chem Dog,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I might've missed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you mention, what was the male you
used to start the outcross?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Chem D BX2, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at that point, when I popped that
first generation of F1 seeds, I saw that
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe it would be a good idea to create
our own female to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't really like a big master
plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of like, look, we're fucking
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we found a BX2 that was very Jack
Herrera linen line, you know, very
[SPEAKER_02]: vigorous and very, and it was like,
well, why don't we use this instead of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Herrera?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that same vein, you know,
you did the Chaska with the Super Silver
[SPEAKER_00]: Haze BX2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a similar story?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any differences with that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a little bit similar, but it's also
a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a, I had a cut of Super.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now I have here at Lucky Dog
Cannabis, I have the Super Silver Haze,
[SPEAKER_02]: as they say, 98 cup winner cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the most, I would say it's the
most, you know, common cut that you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, but I had a cut in the
early 2000s that was, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: better, a Super Silver Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it grew, it had more like a,
the structure was more like a cookie
[SPEAKER_02]: structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had like the, the like tighter nugs as
you go up the stick, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't like the big cola that you get
with the Super Silver Haze, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: with a shorter plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it stretched a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually, I kind of accidentally made
seeds of that by accident a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to tell you what the male
was, but I can't really recall because I
[SPEAKER_02]: did this in like 2000.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2006.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had those seeds in storage and I got
the cut of the 98 cup, the one that's
[SPEAKER_02]: common nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course they smelled almost
identical.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smoke effect was almost identical,
but I just really liked the way the other
[SPEAKER_02]: one tasted better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I liked the way the plant overall
looked better, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really mold resistant, you know,
and like it just, it just, it just was my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I had already started the work
kind of, you know, coincidentally,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, so I took that and I
selected a, a male and I went back to
[SPEAKER_02]: that, to that, to that lady back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those seeds have been in storage for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I got this cut, I was hoping
it was the same cut and it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I started popping those and I found
myself a nice female.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, you know, we could either use
this cut or we could use that seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Ling and that's what I chose to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hoping that I would get some of that
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest though, I don't really feel
like I succeeded on that structure part of
[SPEAKER_02]: that cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's, you know, mixed all up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't seem like it really did,
but it's just what I used and the effect
[SPEAKER_02]: was the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor was the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just went with it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cool to hear that it's a bit
different from the more available one.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we're talking about breeding,
I think as of yet, we really only see
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly F1 hybrids being offered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any interest in doing any lion
breeding or do you feel like you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: happy to be offering F1s?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a followup, how about Femmes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get this question a lot from people
when I, when I get into deeper
[SPEAKER_02]: conversations about what they're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always try to remind folks that
there's a place, you know, for everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for Femmes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And F1s and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my philosophy is that nature intended
for Canada's best to be, to survive the
[SPEAKER_02]: species, to survive in the F1 stage,
that that's the diversity of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: provides like the best chance for
survival.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you know, we have
manipulated nature and survival is really
[SPEAKER_02]: not why we're, why we don't, no one's
breeding for survival.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're breeding for genetic preservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're breeding for vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to improve our favorite
traits with other favorite traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I stick with the F1s and I,
you know, I've made, I've made Feminae
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds in the past, you know, and I would
say that I, what we, what I do at Lucky
[SPEAKER_02]: Dog is this, it's really simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take our favorite cuts and we cross
them with our favorite male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what he does, and we have two
different males, but what they do is they,
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea was never to like, everything is
going to be like Chem now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to take your favorite cut and
we're going to cross our male and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make it so yours is now Chem.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of my trial and error,
that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kept picking, you know, studs that were
a little too dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most people who breed with Chem
Dog can agree that Chem Dog is very
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he, she dominates, you know,
its partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that can be problematic because
that's not where you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're just trying to add a
little extra goodness to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we do here is, you know,
the F1 generation has a lot of variants,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of genetic, you know, traits that
you don't see in any, either one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't, people don't want to buy a pack
of seeds and have 13 different phenos or
[SPEAKER_02]: six different phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to like, they have an idea of
what they're looking for before they even
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the pitchers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have an idea what they're looking for
as soon as they see the cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the trial and error over here was that,
you know, we, we take the stud and we've,
[SPEAKER_02]: the way we selected him, or way I select,
at least I say we, but it says me,
[SPEAKER_02]: selected him was to find him, find the one
that's going to bring the most vigor,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's top, and add potency and add some
gas flavor, some fuel, but not overpower
[SPEAKER_02]: the mother, you know, and furthermore,
to, to keep it limited to say three or
[SPEAKER_02]: four different phenos, you know,
not a million different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the way we do that is that's where
the testing comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We make the cross and a lot of times it
doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a whole dresser drawer full of
seeds that I don't feel like worked with
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses, favorite cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we wanted the testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we do is of course we're looking for
stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for the vigor, but we're
also trying to say, okay, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: no matter how many we pop, we keep finding
the same four phenos roughly, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course there's some variance in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we do that, then we've succeeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if someone wants to buy Kim
Fuego, they know what headband is.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know what sour band or I'm sorry,
sour diesel is, and they know what Kim dog
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they don't want like some odd ball,
you know, usually, and they're probably
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get one every day once in a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is F1 generation, but the work's been
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we've looked at it and
we've said, you know, I would,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would smoke this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would buy this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would grow it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if those boxes get checked and we
don't have just Kim dog, everything turned
[SPEAKER_02]: into Kim dog, and that would be probably
at the top of the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's not what we want, but that work
was done when we selected the male.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we don't just pick the most Kim
dog male.
[SPEAKER_02]: We picked the strongest one that passes on
certain traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: The potency, some of the flavor,
but once again, you have to be careful
[SPEAKER_02]: because the flavor get, you know,
the flavor and aroma can get dominated by
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we just want the potency to pass
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then having a male, a different male
on a female, it creates the F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that creates the vigor we're looking
for, which gives our customer,
[SPEAKER_02]: the end user, the best success,
you know, we think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it because I always say to people
that 90% of the time when someone's buying
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds of a regular strain, they usually
buying it because they want the mother,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the mother is a clone only,
they can't get their hands on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that really compliments
your philosophy in the sense that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing the mother to shine through.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions we got from a lot of
our listeners is, are there any focal
[SPEAKER_00]: differences you might be able to discuss
between the two Kim dog males you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does one bring a certain thing to the
table or is it more just about testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing what happens to work better?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, of course we started off,
you know, I started off with the BX2 and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but then as I took it further,
I started to see that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: of course you think, okay, well,
if we select right with the BX3,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be more of what we're trying
to offer, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That turned out not to be the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like a key and a lock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things just work better with others,
you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really explain to you why it's all
just, you know, my perception of my
[SPEAKER_02]: observation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really have like a master plan
behind any of that, but I, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: was hoping to get to a point where I had a
stud that I can work with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I ended up too, because some just work
better than others, you know, and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of what is reflected in what we offer
because, you know, we keep the BX2 around
[SPEAKER_02]: because it just works better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for instance, the dog patch,
it just works better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like BX3 dominated too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say that most people who've
experienced ChemDog genetics, Chem family
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics would say, you know, ChemD,
what we call ChemD is much, much,
[SPEAKER_02]: much different than ChemDog, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I would say that, you know,
if you could get a ChemD mail,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would help you select a BX3 faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you're making a back cross,
what you're trying to do is you're trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to find something that's not related.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's much easier for you to
differentiate the traits, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have, you know, plant A and
plant B and plant A is the opposite,
[SPEAKER_02]: polar opposite of plant B, this is the
best starting point for making a back
[SPEAKER_02]: cross because your next generation is
going to be so much easier for you to
[SPEAKER_02]: select the traits you're actually looking
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I keep both around because
what I've learned is you can't quite plan
[SPEAKER_02]: out exactly how it's all going to go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that we, you know, it's better if you
just kind of be open-minded and think
[SPEAKER_02]: outside the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if BX2 works better, the BX2 works
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dog patch is a great example of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I tried to use BX3 in hopes to
replace the BX2, I found that it was just
[SPEAKER_02]: too dominant in the cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those very different ChemD traits
weren't coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was definitely not my goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a good example of why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, and I don't, I'm not going to
tell you how, I'm just, because I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will just tell you what I observed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I observed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to keep him because he works
better with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, we found that to be
true with the ChemSister.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what we call the ChemSister
these days, you know, the Bundy Cut or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever they call it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, those are just two good
examples of that, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we delve into some ChemD and faux
ChemDs, I want to ask you, I know you've
[SPEAKER_00]: done some FEMS in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any chance we might see them in
the future or even more specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some S1s?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I realized just right now that I
didn't fully answer your question when you
[SPEAKER_02]: asked me about, you know, F1s and S1s and
feminized and F1 generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, so right now, I feel from
my perspective that feminized seeds are
[SPEAKER_02]: really popular, you know, maybe because
they're a better bang for your buck.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you get 12, 13 female plants
guaranteed for roughly the same price.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I always try to kind of remind the
consumer, customer, grower, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just basically two different
tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're two different approaches to a
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: F1s, we're not really preserving the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're not preserving mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not preserving, you know,
one of the two plants in the cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that for feminized seeds,
of course, having females can be very
[SPEAKER_02]: useful to some folks, especially when they
live in a state that doesn't have really,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, legal cannabis and they have to
be careful with their numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't make a case against that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would support that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you're a home grower,
if you're growing your own cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is always someone who's on my mind
when I do any kind of work, is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you want success.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you can have success with
S1s and feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're going to have a higher rate of
just yield, you know, getting a jar of
[SPEAKER_02]: flour to smoke for, you know, several
months, which is what you might need with
[SPEAKER_02]: an F1 cross, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just try to remind people that,
like, you know, they each have their
[SPEAKER_02]: place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say that, you know,
feminized seeds, S1s, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're more geared, in my opinion,
towards, if you know exactly what you
[SPEAKER_02]: want, you know, you're not really
interested in any kind of variation,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're, in other words, like genetic
preservation, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, with the regular seeds,
F1s, F2s, we're making F2s now too,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are going to be, that's what you're
going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want genetic preservation,
if you know you want this, and maybe you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to buy a couple hundred of those
feminized seeds and kind of go through
[SPEAKER_02]: them over the course of your few years and
find exactly what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yes, we have made feminized seeds
in the, I've made feminized seeds in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past, and I'm getting ready to make
another round.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be using the CrossRoad Chem,
and we're going to basically cross it to
[SPEAKER_02]: all of my favorite cuts and test them out
and see how people like them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yes, there'll be an S,
you know, a CrossRoad Chem S1 in there
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh la la, so much different angles to go
off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the question I've been asked a few
times by some listeners is, you just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned the CrossRoad Chems,
are you able to tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: that one specifically, what it's like,
what maybe sort of traits it would bring
[SPEAKER_00]: to a cross, and how it differs from the
Chem Crush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think people get a bit confused
because they notice they have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: lineages, so how are they different,
and what do you like about the CrossRoad
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so the CrossRoad Chem and the Chem
Crush are both Chem 91 females crossed
[SPEAKER_02]: with a San Fernando Valley OG Kush BX2.
[SPEAKER_02]: BX2 came from Shay Budden from 707 Seed
Bank, a top-notch breeder, one of the best
[SPEAKER_02]: out there, maybe not the most well-known,
but definitely someone who's been doing
[SPEAKER_02]: work for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know him because I gave him the Chem 91
in, I think, circa 2006, which,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he kind of took it up to Arcada
and gave it to all those guys up in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was all chance, you know,
it was like a random moment where it was
[SPEAKER_02]: like this guy you know, we should hand,
I should hand him the cut, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like he's gonna do some good things with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just was one of those inspirational
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, this is the plant speaking
at the moment, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I did, and so that, you know,
years later we lost contact, and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: as we all do out here in the gutters of
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, I ran back into him and he
had a bunch of seeds he'd been trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: give me a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went through a few of them,
a lot of them I think were kind of getting
[SPEAKER_02]: old, and you know, I probably have a bunch
left, they weren't really like great
[SPEAKER_02]: germination rates, I think because they
were old.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did find the male that I used in
that cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I made the cross, I popped a
bunch of those seeds and I found that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I had two distinct phenos that I found
that I could not decide between.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be, you know, they're both
phenos of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, the chem crush is more
of like a chem dog pheno, whereas the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the crossroad chem is more of a cushy,
more balanced, more cottony, I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: how to explain it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just couldn't decide between the
two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went with both, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get that question a lot and
sometimes I'm like, geez, I shouldn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: done that, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's just hard to, it's hard to
express, it's hard to kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of hard to like express to people
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, but that's basically the
difference, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both standalone, they're,
they're our sisters, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just that I couldn't decide
between the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that one was distinctly more
chem and the other was distinctly more
[SPEAKER_02]: cushy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I said, fuck it, let's just use
them both, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been a minute since we've spoken
and in that time, Lucky Dog Seed Co has
[SPEAKER_00]: flourished and had a lot of success with a
lot of strains that have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: quite, quite a strong cult following.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're going to have to drill
into a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one that comes to mind for me is
the Hunza Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the reason for that is,
you know, it's a combination of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: skelly and the chem and there's not a ton
of skelly crosses out there and people are
[SPEAKER_00]: really interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you think the Hunza Valley has got
a cult following and how would you
[SPEAKER_00]: describe it to anyone if they're
interested in sort of hearing your
[SPEAKER_00]: description of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would say that why I feel like
it's been popular is the same reason I
[SPEAKER_02]: love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those turps are so unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the burnt rubber, the fresh tennis
ball, can, you know, all the things people
[SPEAKER_02]: describe about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm big on indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got body pains and I love something that
relaxes my muscle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fell in love with the skelly when I
obtained it and I couldn't wait to make a
[SPEAKER_02]: cross with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to make something.
[SPEAKER_02]: The skelly is notoriously difficult to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't see it in a shop like this
because it's not a producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's extremely, you know,
botrytis-resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even though it's got that wet,
greasy, you know, trichome, not sandy,
[SPEAKER_02]: not dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really, it's just perfect for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, and that's kind of it right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you find a plant, a clone only,
that's difficult to not only obtain,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also to produce, grow, then,
but you love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be frustrating because you want
to share it with the world, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, so that was the motivation behind
making the Hunza Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I feel like the Hunza
Valley passes on most of those traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: The skelly is very dominant in that cross,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's, you won't find a lot of
chem-doggy stuff in those.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to find more indica,
skelly, burnt rubber, tennis ball,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, heavy-duty indica, you know,
phenos when you pop those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really happy with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad people enjoy it because it's
one of my favorites that I have for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually hate to say it out loud,
but I like the Hunza Valley more than the
[SPEAKER_02]: skelly, the phenos that I've grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were fun to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a little bit more stretch than
the skelly, which I think is useful to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for end users.
[SPEAKER_02]: The skelly is, you know, complicated,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though it's pretty durable,
pretty, you know, it's, I guess durable
[SPEAKER_02]: would be my other word.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to screw it up, but it's just,
you know, the fact that it's so short and
[SPEAKER_02]: squat, it's like, you have to know how to
grow it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Hunza Valley gives you a little bit
more, a little bit more flexibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: A safety net.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives you a little bit more stretch,
a little bit more air you can get through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just wanted to share that cut
with the world as I discovered it and the
[SPEAKER_02]: Hunza Valley allowed me to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it just was one of those,
it's one of the crosses that just really
[SPEAKER_02]: worked out, you know, like instantly,
you know, not a lot of thought,
[SPEAKER_02]: not a lot of testing had to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just worked, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And definitely one of the ones I've been
eyeing off myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to ask you, because it's been on
my mind for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are whispers that some people,
including myself, have been partial to the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that maybe skelly has got some
relation to the cam dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow up at the bare minimum,
do you see any similarities in the flavor?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard that and I've even,
I even mentioned on the back of the pack
[SPEAKER_02]: that that people have mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, of course there's no way to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how we would figure that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitely both have crossed
Leadville, Colorado for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, the super skunk was
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leadville, Colorado, you know,
I've only snowboarded there over the years
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe I spent the night at someone's
house.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the way to see some, you know,
Grateful Daddy stuff in the Denver area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But besides that, you know, I can't say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I feel like I see a direct
resemblance, especially when you take into
[SPEAKER_02]: consideration the Northern Lights,
the NL1, because that one seems to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: like when you asked me where, what traits
do I see outside of cam dog that are cam
[SPEAKER_02]: doggy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that from my memory,
that would be the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Skelly, I can only say that because
people who are closer to that cut,
[SPEAKER_02]: the puck, have mentioned it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say that's impossible,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say maybe if you took Kim D and
set it next to its sister, the cam dog,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you took Skelly and you set it
next to the cam dog, you would probably
[SPEAKER_02]: say the Skelly had more resemblance,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't really know, you know,
and I don't like to speculate on those
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's so much diversity in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you think you can identify
traits on different strains, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you find out there is no resemblance.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no actual, not resemblance,
but no relation, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can surprise you, and it does often.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know that that's what folks from
the Leadville area at that circa 1989-ish,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, set, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look, while we're on the topic of
Leadville and the infamous Joe Brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cam brand has gained a lot of
popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess for a lot of people,
they may think of it as like sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: pure cam line in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how you would describe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think they're actually getting a
little something different than two cam
[SPEAKER_00]: dogs crossed together, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: The JB cut, as I call it, and I think that
you, Bodhi coined that name for it,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is I love.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were familiar with the JB cut for,
it was called the JB cut in Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Sonoma County, honestly, over most of
the last couple of decades, we weren't
[SPEAKER_02]: that concerned about names.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were more concerned about what
customers wanted, and it was on scale,
[SPEAKER_02]: large scale, and it was always OG
cushions, and it was always sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no matter what else came through,
those were the ones that always were
[SPEAKER_02]: getting asked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had this cut, and I honestly cannot
tell you where it came from, but we used
[SPEAKER_02]: to call it the sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people call it the sour diesel in my
little circle, and of course it's not the
[SPEAKER_02]: sour diesel, but it was very similar to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the distinction was tighter nugs,
heavier nugs, shorter squatter plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it had every bit of that smell that
the sour diesel is known for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we called it a sour diesel,
or some of us call it a sour diesel IBL,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm not really sure like where that
originated from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if it's actually that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just what people called it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were growing and cropping that
out at scale before I even knew who Joe
[SPEAKER_02]: Brand was, before I even heard of who he
was, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't come across ChemDog cuts,
the ChemDog, or the ChemD, or any of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem family.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get that from any of the ChemDog
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got her outside of that, coincidentally,
as I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then, you know, that cut was with us,
and what happened was, it's really a cute
[SPEAKER_02]: story actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what happened was I was going through a
divorce at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a home in Oakland I was working in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a home in Sebastopol I was working
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I had two homes in Sebastopol,
California that I was working in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's about an hour difference drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was also an apprentice, an electrical
worker apprentice at the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was working a lot, and there's
always a lot of communication and
[SPEAKER_02]: construction.
[SPEAKER_02]: My ex-wife wanted me to get a real job at
some point, because cannabis wasn't a real
[SPEAKER_02]: job, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's always risk with cannabis,
and she felt that the danger was affecting
[SPEAKER_02]: our family's security and happiness,
and just kind of our day-to-day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I succumbed, and I became an apprentice
in the electrical industry with the IBEW.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was working a lot, and I had a
partner in Oakland that he was living
[SPEAKER_02]: there, and I was living there half-time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a basement full of herb,
and one day he approached me and said,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, there's this guy named Joe Brand,
and the guy who popped the chem-dog seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: G, asked if we wouldn't mind giving him a
cut of the chem-dog 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't know any of the story,
so he told me the story, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: huh, that's an interesting story.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never actually, this is 2006,
mind you, I'd never actually heard about
[SPEAKER_02]: all the stuff that happened at Deer Creek,
and it's odd, it's kind of weird to think
[SPEAKER_02]: about, but it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't really privy to that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: My experience with the chem-dog was
outside of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had nothing to do with those folks,
just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he explained to me, and I said,
well, yeah, of course, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's explaining to me that the guy was
kind of, all these people, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: were out of contact with each other,
it was all chance meetings, and then here
[SPEAKER_02]: we are in 2006, I think it was 2006,
2005, where a lot of these folks could get
[SPEAKER_02]: in contact with each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciated that, even though I wasn't
part of that, I appreciated that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I said, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we have some cuttings in the
basement that are rooting, and he had to
[SPEAKER_02]: ask me for my permission.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lock on that cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I went to work in Napa,
and I was working at the Napa High School,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the lighting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I said, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a little backstory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my roommate at the time was,
and I've known him for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to be very close, and we've known
each other since the Grateful Dead days,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's our history.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of nostalgia, yada yada.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's a chem head.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loves it, and he gets it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he actually knew G.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why they were able to talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually met each other on the East
Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: They kind of grew up in the same area in
the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I agreed, and I just went to sleep
and woke up, went to work the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what had been going on in the
background is that my roommate was selling
[SPEAKER_02]: packs of Chem 91 that he was getting from
another grower in our area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was surprised by that, because I
know the guy, and he asked me for the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, no, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it appeared, according to my roommate,
that he had obtained a cut somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was curious about how is that
possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have the time or energy to even
really give a damn, but I was curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every night I would call him from
work, and I would see turkey bags of what
[SPEAKER_02]: he was saying was Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as far as I'm concerned, he should
know what Chem 91 is, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's his favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the chem dog heads in my little
circle, and he's certainly in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I came home from work the next day,
and I said, did your buddy come over?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, did you give him a cut?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I went down to the basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see any cuts going on anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, well, I was over at my homie's
house, who I've been getting these packs
[SPEAKER_02]: of Chem 91 from, and he had a rooted
cutting right then and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, hey, I think I got Skunk VA's
permission, but let me just go ahead and
[SPEAKER_02]: grab one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a nice healthy rooted one here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was picking up some packs of Chem
91, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's how he got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he passed it to JB, and so that's
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, I came home from work,
and he told me that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I'm still very curious
about this Chem 91 cut that I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would they ask me if they already got
it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was opening up turkey bags right at
that moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was in the dining room, and he was
in kind of a darkened living room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, I said, is that that Chem
91 that you've been kind of rocking the
[SPEAKER_02]: last few packs?
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, that's not Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, you're in another room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you should know better than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see from here it's not Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I walked in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took the bud from his hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when he was smelling, I smelled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I threw it back in the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you should know better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then his eyes got big as headlights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he was like, oh my god.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I'm going to bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I said, so that's the cut you gave
that guy that you asked me about?
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, it sure is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And his jaw hit the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what to say about all
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: The power of suggestion, I think,
is very strong with any of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's a good case of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like I said, I had already been
familiar with that particular cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had been rocking it for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we rocked it along after that,
separate from this partnership that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: describing to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't really think much of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then later on, maybe I don't remember
what happened to the one I had,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cut of the sour diesel IBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just kind of went away somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: And years later, I heard that there was a
cross that Bodie had made of the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he had started to call the mother the
JB cut, the Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: JB cut, a Joe Brand cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh, that's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone on the East Coast who prefers to
stay anonymous, he sent me the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was the same fucking cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the same one that we used to rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we used to really get good yields from
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then Bodie had kind of coined the
phrase JB cut, which I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that happened in my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always wanted to make a cross with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a little bit stronger,
vigorous version of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has all that stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I got it, I couldn't wait to
make a cross with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And luckily, it came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not Chem Dog on Chem Dog because
it's not Chem Dog on Chem Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorite crosses that I've
made to smoke, to grow out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to grow, easy to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just punches you in the face.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the story on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one that's piqued my interest just
hearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a question or two before,
you mentioned the old NLs and how the Chem
[SPEAKER_00]: does remind you of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be interested to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen a bit of a resurgence of NLs,
both in terms of some seed offerings,
[SPEAKER_00]: but even just other breeders talking about
how they would love to get some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: NL lines they tried in their youth back
into the stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any fond memories of NLs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever wanted to explore that realm
at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was a young man in Virginia,
I got as a 17-year-old, a minor,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is kind of a key to my life,
that I was a minor, I got in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got in big trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got in trouble for possession and
distribution of LSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they wanted to charge me as an adult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to jump through a lot of hoops
to not be charged as an adult.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a good friend who was 18 that night
who got set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got set up by the same snitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he actually had a very different
outcome because he was 18.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had gotten in trouble when I was 17,
probably about five months before I turned
[SPEAKER_02]: 18, I'm thinking, roughly, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they still wanted to charge me as an
adult.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is heyday drug war, 1990,
I think, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And very, very aggressive law enforcement,
very aggressive war on drugs in Virginia,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were going to maybe he got 18
years suspended for 18 years to give you a
[SPEAKER_02]: comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas I had an opportunity to not really
do any jail time or not really do much
[SPEAKER_02]: jail time as a minor or do maybe some hard
time, five or six years is what they were
[SPEAKER_02]: saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were talking about putting a
17-year-old in a cage with grown men.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could never imagine a crime to where a
child, even someone who's about to become
[SPEAKER_02]: an adult, should belong in a cage with
adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're guaranteeing you're destroying that
person's future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my attorney, which was like a
court-appointed attorney, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_02]: because we were poor ass, fought hard for
me to make sure that didn't happen,
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding that that was going to
negatively impact my life forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back then, we had in Virginia,
we had the Super Skunk, we had NL,
[SPEAKER_02]: which turned out to be NL-1, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had the Nigerian, we called the
Nige.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the Afghani, a couple different
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: These were all like stuff you would find
in the seed catalogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff became the legend of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were right at ground zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how, but we were.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beatrix Choice, of course, I've talked to
you about that one before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those were the ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it had a hierarchy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could find Nigerian easier,
Nige quicker, Afghan quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just what we called it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was obviously more to the names than
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just what we called it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I got in my memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the harder ones would be,
and then the Super Skunk, and then you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: get to the NL.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, the Beatrix Choice
was the holy grail.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hardest to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these were roughly the strains that we
could find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were primo.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what makes a young person fall in
love with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was on probation from that charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: My guy sent me to, he said, you're going
to have to go to a rehab, which was pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: vogue back in the late 80s, early 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to have to play the part.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were addicted to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were addicted to LSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were addicted to psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's your story.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to stick to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to fucking beat it with a
drum.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to save your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he convinced me as a young man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was an interesting experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I met the man who became,
and to this day is my mentor, who made the
[SPEAKER_02]: Super Skunk, as we know it, the F2,
the number six, as a lot of these people
[SPEAKER_02]: out here call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know somebody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he approached me at one of these NA
meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he handed me a Grateful Dead tape.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, he's an adult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm in a minor in a facility where
people are coming off the street for an NA
[SPEAKER_02]: meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were forced, as the minors,
to go to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, it's part of the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he knew that we weren't allowed to
have anything to do with Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grateful Dead music or paraphernalia,
meaning like t-shirts, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cygnias, symbology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all considered drug paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not allowed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a minor in this place, you're a
child.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not allowed to have a Grateful Dead
bootleg tape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm at this meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I'm doing to try to save my
life, according to my attorney,
[SPEAKER_02]: mind you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I go up, as anyone who's ever been
to these things, know that coffee is the
[SPEAKER_02]: big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm at the thing, getting the coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 7 p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got people off the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the adults who are in patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not allowed to talk to the minors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be a big problem for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get kicked out of the program.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I'm at the coffee thing,
and a man taps my shoulder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, don't turn around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't turn around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he handed me a Grateful Dead tape.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I hear you youngins aren't allowed
to have these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, no, we're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he goes, well, here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I shoved it down my pants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That turned out to be the guy who made the
F2, the Super Skunk, my mentor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of a chance thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I met him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after I got out, I went through my
case.
[SPEAKER_02]: I became on probation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to quit smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to stay in town.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very strict.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to be known where I was at all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I remember we went up to some
friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was on board.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, if you smoke, you're going
to go to prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, what am I not going to
hang out?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we doing here?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to help you with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't really stated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of loose.
[SPEAKER_02]: We stated that we're just not going to
smoke around him, JK.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just going to help him not hurt
his own self.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: But however, at the end of this period of
time in probation, all my friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: my circles, were heading up to Boston to
the Boston Gardens to see the Grateful
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead there.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 1991, it would have been at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I convinced them to let me go,
even though that could have been dangerous
[SPEAKER_02]: for me as far as my probation goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: People hear probation now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was different back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was just a simple procedure to get
you in prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a way around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was more serious, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we get up to Boston.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we go to the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a good boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take a little acid, but I don't smoke
any weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friends are keeping it away from me to
a degree, watching out for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: being good friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after the show, we all pile into
a car.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was six of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all I can do is sit down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even smell the fucking bag of weed
in someone's pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't help myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, can I just look at it,
y'all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Show me the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the Northern Lights?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they won't say a word, because they
know that once that domino gut starts to
[SPEAKER_02]: fall, all of them are going to fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, on the way to the hotel from the
show, some guy took a little too much too
[SPEAKER_02]: fast and took all his clothes off,
as they sometimes do at those events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was having a psychedelic
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was getting a little too intense for
the default world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he was surrounded by Boston's
finest, the law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all had to wait for this whole
movie to unfold.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we're trying to just get to the hotel,
we're exhausted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sitting in a car for an hour and a
half, smelling this bag of weed that no
[SPEAKER_02]: one will show me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's driving me insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we get to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I say, listen, I'm smoking that damn
joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a damn what anyone says.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's going to stop me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The consequences are mine and mine alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not your fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you roll that, and they did,
they rolled that $50 eighth of Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights, that sticky, icky, gooky,
goodness, into a $50 fucking joint with a
[SPEAKER_02]: club, a nice wrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a beautiful joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can picture it in my mind right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we smoked that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time I'd smoked in a
whole year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone passed out almost
immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you haven't smoked weed in that
long and your tolerance is down,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a much different effect, as we all
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I turned on that kung fu.
[SPEAKER_02]: Food theater.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I laughed my fucking ass off until I
practically pissed my pants, tears
[SPEAKER_02]: streaming down my eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was probably the best joint I ever
smoked in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had smoked it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the Northern Lights, as we called
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked them, I was like, where'd y
'all get this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, well, we got it here in the
parking lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the parking lot was flooded.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know whose weed this is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't really know the guy's name.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we knew it was from Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, this is from Richmond,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, yeah, sure enough,
it was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started opening up to me about it now
that it's too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they told me all about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, it's better than ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, let's smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's my memory of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll stick with me forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, I had memories of it before
because we used to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was so significant in my life
because it was exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was once again breaking the fucking law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And rightfully so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I smoked that joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And luckily, I got off probation with
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 30 days, when I got off probation,
I was already on Jerry Garcia's band's
[SPEAKER_02]: East Coast tour, which was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never got drug tested again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went back to my final probation meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so obviously, you've had this very
memorable and impactful experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: the NO-1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, we hear a lot of chat about the
NL-5 making a resurgence from a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different seed sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Matt and Caleb who have done
theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Todd McCormick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has the NL-5 ever held a similar
reminiscent spot in your mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: or was it really just that NL-1?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just that NL-1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just do it as NL, Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm speculating when I call it NL-1
based on what I've seen since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the holy grails of my world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that particular cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the ones that I've seen that folks
have been working with maybe since then,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a little convoluted to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly where did it come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it get there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the same cut?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the similarity is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I go with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the NL-5 is not quite.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my perception.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you had that Northern Lights,
let's just call it Northern Lights,
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's what we called it back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you had that, to go to the NL-5,
it's just not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a similar name, but it's a much
different phenom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just not in that avenue that I
fell in love with, just to be truthful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more common.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that's skewed my perception a
little bit, too, because I love the
[SPEAKER_02]: rarities of some cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm drawn to the rarity of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how did it make it this far?
[SPEAKER_02]: But ultimately, the experience when you
smoke it, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just can't compare the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like they're even in the same
ballpark.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Matt was nice enough to send me some
of those seeds that you're speaking of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't wait to go through them,
but I haven't yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be cool to see what comes out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, in that same vein,
we've seen some skunk 1 seeds pop their
[SPEAKER_00]: head out, as well as some original hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do either of those ones hold a spot in
your mind, or you just didn't really get
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Original hay would be out of my
wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when it comes to skunk, that's right
in my wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hate to tell you, it's not fair.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least from my perception.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's got a different opinion about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can fight about it if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've been around a long time,
and I know what skunk smells like,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think we all do.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you live in North America, you know
what a skunk smells like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't smell that when you smell
the weed, be careful calling it skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we all know what a skunk smells
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like a gardenia.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what a gardenia smells like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody does.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everyone knows what a skunk smells
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we don't smell that,
let's be honest with ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that sounds horrible to say,
but it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that smell that the super skunk had,
that was what they call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't call it roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was right in the middle of all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't call it that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can call it that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that name comes from modern times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't come from back in the late 80s,
early 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunk was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so real growers in Virginia,
the ones that really put it all on the
[SPEAKER_02]: line back then, the ones that really did
what they wanted to do in spite of United
[SPEAKER_02]: States laws, Virginia state laws,
draconian drug laws, those are the guys
[SPEAKER_02]: that were growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what worse strain to grow than super
skunk or skunk one, basic skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would be worse for you to grow in a
place that, you know, there's no such
[SPEAKER_02]: thing as a carbon filter reminds you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what did they do?
[SPEAKER_02]: They take that dead skunk that they found
on the highway that they scooped up and
[SPEAKER_02]: put in a garbage bag and they throw it in
front of their fucking house until someone
[SPEAKER_02]: came and cleaned it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they go get another one until,
you know, until their house didn't smell
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly like that skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason they did that is because
that smell was so similar to that dead
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk that, you know, it worked right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we all know what skunk smells like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like we have to be honest for
ourselves when we describe things and each
[SPEAKER_02]: other.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not around anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, but it's not around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look, I guess that answered my next
question, which was going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have any leads on the super skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess as if we zoom out a bit,
there has been a bit of discussion in the
[SPEAKER_00]: community around the super skunk that is
passed around and whether the mass super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk as we call it was the same as the
original one that you first had.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: My thoughts are my experience and my
experience is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, you call him Staten Island,
but we were very, he's my mentor,
[SPEAKER_02]: my brother, someone I love.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've known each other for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's responsible.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's who I got the chem dog from.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one who taught me everything that
he knew at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one that I, you know,
I kind of linked up with some very private
[SPEAKER_02]: growers in Virginia where they traded
super skunk for chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he traded it to chem dog for the super
skunk based on all the stories I tell him
[SPEAKER_02]: about, you know, it's like the one that
got away, you know, like the super skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got to check out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course he had heard of it, but he
hadn't seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when he brought it back, you know,
he told me that he'd passed it around some
[SPEAKER_02]: other folks in the Tri-State area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't matter to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a kid, mind you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I was just grateful to kind
of make the connection or be part of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: or just, you know, the joy, like show my
friends in Virginia and him that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I care about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not just, I'm just don't
want to smoke the joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be, you know, it's what I can do
to help, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not like when you're that young,
you don't think too much into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just do what your role is,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so anyways, you know, and he brought
the super skunk back out to Sonoma County
[SPEAKER_02]: where we were at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And was very grateful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the way it went.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we did lose it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did lose it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember the day I have so many
details.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember we did lose it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to say, you know, 1998,
I think is when it was, it was very early
[SPEAKER_02]: on, you know, luckily I'd passed it up to
some people in Humboldt County,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe two or three years before
that in 1995 ish, you know, when,
[SPEAKER_02]: when all this happened for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was always a possibility we
could go get it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people I passed it to didn't have it
anymore if they had passed it to another
[SPEAKER_02]: guy who was going to give it back to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That never actually happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we kind of lost it, you know,
and we went on and that was that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and, and it's one of the
saddest, most regretful things that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: ever experienced in my life is,
you know, losing that cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then, you know, fast forward to
2006, when I met G, you know, Kim dog,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I met him because I, and I think I
told you before in the previous story,
[SPEAKER_02]: but so I won't get into that, but I,
uh, when I went out, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to get the Kim sis and I mean
the real original Kim sis and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and bring him back some Kim dog cuts,
some healthy, good Kim dog cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, as I've said before, and so what
he ended up giving me was the Kim D and
[SPEAKER_02]: the super skunk as he put it to me,
he got, and I said, the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was surprised when he gave it to me,
cause this wasn't part of the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and he said, yeah, the one that you
guys brought up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back then, you know, in 1992 or three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, wow, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he didn't call it the mask.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't call it the MSS.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just called the super skunk,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I took it back home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I flew it back home to California and grew
them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I've told you about the Kim
D whatever this was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: my big hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, wow, what a bonus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is going to be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been missing this cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: We gave up on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We let it go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We mourned it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, I grew it out and I've
immediately noticed the stretch wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the super skunk has a,
I've shown pictures on my Instagram and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I, I documented what the super
skunk was in photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as good a photos you could take in
1995 with a, with a camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so, you know, the stretch wasn't
there alarming, you know, but there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of resemblance in the
structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went with it and then I just kept on
waiting for that to smell, kept on
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just never appeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then 2006, like as best as I knew,
and I want to say that best as we knew,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'll say as best as I knew,
there was a thing called genetic drift,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe that's what happened to
it, but it was such a painful memory of
[SPEAKER_02]: something that was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I just said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want this cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to let it go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not interested in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is it, it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm letting go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not like me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't let cuts go like that,
but I did only after one car.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I was kind of like,
damn, dude, I didn't even get the chemsys,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like what the fuck, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, then fast forward to say 2000,
let's just say 18 or 19.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say, you know, then, you know,
of course, but now we're hearing about the
[SPEAKER_02]: mass super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, someone was kind enough on the
East coast to send me, um, and I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: even, it was almost anonymous and,
but he definitely had the credentials to
[SPEAKER_02]: have the mass super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows all the people and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I grew it out and it was the same
fucking cut that I got from G in 2006.
[SPEAKER_02]: I immediately recognized it doesn't have
the skunk turps, doesn't have all the
[SPEAKER_02]: things I love.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I don't even have that
cut anymore because it's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying it's a standalone for some,
it may, but you have to understand that
[SPEAKER_02]: like, it just brings up a bad memory for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like a disappointment,
no matter how good it is on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you, when you have the perception I
have, it's just a disappointment,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cause you know, the super skunk
was the Holy grail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was one of the best cuts that's ever,
you know, and on this planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just a bad, you know,
kind of memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I let it go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I do believe based on what they've
told me there that at one point that super
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk cut from Virginia was the cut that
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I wasn't around for all those
decades in their circle, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you'd have to ask them,
but to me, it seems like something got
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause how could that be, you know,
the Holy grail?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's just not that great in my
opinion, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe because of my perception,
but still, I ain't, I'm not trying to dog
[SPEAKER_02]: cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, don't send me no hate mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, it's just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fucking weirdo, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's good to get some clarification
from your perspective for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, while we're on the topic of
the super skunk and you even referenced
[SPEAKER_00]: Staten Island guy himself, I get tons of
people messaging me, asking me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, was that weasel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it this guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think he's ever going to pop his
head out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will we ever hear from Staten Island?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just from my perspective, it seems like he
played a huge role in the chem dog story
[SPEAKER_00]: and people are naturally curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it someone the community knows or do
you think he'll remain a mystery?
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer is no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, no, he's not part of the,
you know, no, he's not someone part of you
[SPEAKER_02]: say part of the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, he seems like he's, he's not
interested in all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's interested in the work, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and so, you know, we've had our
falling outs in the past and we've come
[SPEAKER_02]: together as family members do,
and that's us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love him with all my heart and he's
meant the world to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, he was not supposed to do
what he did with me, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he took a chance on me, you know,
and I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's a, you know, he, I don't want to
say he's private.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really necessarily think he is.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just not interested in all this,
you know, he just wants to do the work and
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't speak for him, but that's all I
can tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but no, he's none of those
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knows them all, but he does not know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of dudes in the weed
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's just back it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people who are into
cannabis, fine cannabis, who did their
[SPEAKER_02]: work in Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he knows all the ones you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, and furthermore,
like if, if, if, if this was important to
[SPEAKER_02]: him, he's how many opportunities has he
had?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, lots, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, he's never expressed to me that he
gives a fuck about any of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, kudos to you, Mr. Staten Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all appreciative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sure are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to ask you earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned when you were talking about
the strains you would get in Virginia,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the Afghani was one in the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the Virginia beach Afghani we see
nowadays?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, based off memory, um, the Afghani was
honestly a little bit more like the chem
[SPEAKER_02]: dog than the Virginia beach Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would get, you know, and like we
called it the Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we called it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as anyone knows, none of those seeds
were really called Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were crosses, you know, in this and
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, I, and I can't say which one it
was, you know, I can't say, but I can tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you, it came from that seed stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can pretty accurately say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't say firsthand, but I would guess
hard that it was, but the Virginia beach
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani, um, which I have, I, I love it
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's probably not exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one had the, the Afghan had a bit
more stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Virginia beach Afghani is pretty
squat, you know, typical Afghan highland
[SPEAKER_02]: type of strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this particular Fino of whatever,
whichever cross it actually was,
[SPEAKER_02]: was a bit more stretchy, had a bit more
smell, had a bit more punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it was definitely in the same
realm, definitely in the same family.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no doubt, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, while we're on the topic of super
skunks, I want to ask you, there's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of discussion about whether or not
it's possible that the Chem D is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: just Chem 91 crossed to a super skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is that Chem 91 is in fact the
mother of Chem D and it's possibly just a
[SPEAKER_00]: super skunk herm on to it, something along
those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: What thoughts come to mind when you hear
that immediately?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my first thought is, does Chem D
smell like skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the Chem D to me is an
anomaly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't know where it came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what it is exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only take what I hear from the
people who say they know on face value,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I definitely have questions about what
I hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, all I can spec, all I can do is
speculate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say, no, you know,
it just doesn't like, it's just such an
[SPEAKER_02]: anomaly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Chem D it's like outside of all of
this, it seems to me, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like of course, like who am I to say
what's what as far as like, and I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: mean like the stories, I mean like what is
possible in genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you make crosses, like what kind
of recessive genes can pop out and create
[SPEAKER_02]: something that smells like trash,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just doesn't relate to anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't make any claims.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, I just have questions
probably more than most people do,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it just doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say, no, based on what I know
of those two cuts, you know, we've worked
[SPEAKER_02]: with crosses of super skunk and Chem D or
Chem Dog, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so none of them came out like the Chem
D, you know, we had, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Staten Island, as you call this human,
we, you know, super dog seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the first time I'd ever seen weed
come from seed, you know, the super dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it had that skunky turf,
you know, it had those, those Chem Dog,
[SPEAKER_02]: earthy, tiny, just like dripping goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nothing came out like the Chem D.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never smelled anything like the Chem D
until I smelled the Chem D.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could say since then, the only
things that I have smelled that are like
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem D are crosses with, made with the
Chem D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dog patch, glue, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, that's a Chem D cross,
GMO's got some Chem D in it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think GMO's Chem D.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think Gorilla Glue uses a
different Chem cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm not really that familiar,
but I can, I grow the GMO here and I can
[SPEAKER_02]: say, yep, that's Chem D.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no doubt, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: We call them trash turps here,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: We call them fucking disgusting trash
turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tell people, say, you're gonna smell
this at first, you're not gonna like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a second, and you're gonna love
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's exactly what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like everybody feels this way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's repulsive, yet attractive,
all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it goes in that order.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck to, man, let me smell that
again, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we didn't come across any of those,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've taken down many of those super,
super dog seed phenos and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were two or three different types of
phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't anything like Chem D.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never smelled anything like that in
cannabis until I actually smelled the Chem
[SPEAKER_02]: D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, there's a very rigorous
discussion around all the various
[SPEAKER_00]: different Chem D cuttings there are
without delving into, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to identify them from visuals or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why do you think there are so many
different Chem D cuts out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it just piggybacks off what
you said before, where it's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's unique, people are looking for their
own version?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think there's something extra
which goes into why we see, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Matt counted them at one point and
there's something like seven different
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D cuts that float around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard there's a few different
floating around, but I didn't know that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only can go to what my, I can only based
on my experience with cannabis and what
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard and combined the two and I
would say that most likely cuts got lost
[SPEAKER_02]: and S1s popped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to like not speculate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's enough of that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't, I don't think that my
speculation needs to be added to the hat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't find it to be useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find that speculations usually lead
to, you know, nope, that's not it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I don't really know,
you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just took, take it on face value,
you know, if I wasn't there, then I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that allows you for a good
night's sleep when you live by this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's the, you know, the internet
detectives who have it all figured out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, their version has got,
you know, the phrase I hear that it always
[SPEAKER_02]: makes me pauses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how does it make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, does it make sense genetically?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are you talking about recessive
genes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you talking about combinations of
genetics that make a brand new product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what does it make sense to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, how does it make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that phrase makes me pause,
you know, people say it to me all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be like, they'll ask me a question
and I'll tell them my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell them my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell them a story about what happened
that I was there for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they'll say, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of this makes fucking sense to
anyone, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, how does it make sense to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people will have biases.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have perceptions that they hold onto.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what it is, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be about anything in life,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we all hold onto that and we have to
be careful with that because we can add a
[SPEAKER_02]: false narrative to a story that's not even
ours to tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this happens every day in cannabis,
as we know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to add to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My experience is limited, but it's also
vast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a lot of experience with some of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of chance, kind of
coincidentally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm okay with just sticking with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need to figure out anything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let the people, the internet
detectives, figure that out and I'll enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: their stories as they come, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a diplomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look, while we're on the topic,
you mentioned the super dog and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about strains from sort of
yesteryear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any strains from the Sonoma Bay
Area, Mendo sort of area in that 95 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 2005 period that you miss that aren't the
super skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe strains that don't get as much of a
mention, but you do remember like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, that was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of wish we had that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_02]: My answer is probably pretty boring to
that because we're so delved into our chem
[SPEAKER_02]: dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got the Sour Diesel, I was like,
wow, look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had already been around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even get that cut until like,
let's say 2002, three-ish, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: My perception is kind of, you have to
understand that I lived in a bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't out here in the world like,
hey man, like we're, this is what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we were very private.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we lived in the old school by the old
school rules.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we don't talk about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the downside of that was like,
maybe we didn't get introduced to a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts, but if, but the answer to that
question in the Bay Area would have been
[SPEAKER_02]: that super silver, a haze cut that I
mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a standout.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was outside of our lane, outside of our
realm, but it was lovely, beautiful,
[SPEAKER_02]: and just amazing smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be the first thing that pops
to my mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, of course, you know, like when I
discovered OG Kush, I was probably a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit around that era, like 2003.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that may have been a little late in
the OG Kush story, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me and my perspective and my little
bubble, like, wow, you know, this is
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that would fall in that category.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these answers aren't like sexy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not fucking fun, but they are,
that's the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I was just in a bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were just growing Super Skunk,
Chem Dog, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then eventually Sour Diesel,
but like we were stuck in that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, my little circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, totally understandable if that's what
you were working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sort of almost on the forefront
in a sense, but because no one really knew
[SPEAKER_00]: how good Chem was at that time,
it's only now I feel like it's really in
[SPEAKER_00]: the zeitgeist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we are, I was die hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just grow what I like, you know,
like I don't pay attention to the outside
[SPEAKER_02]: noise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never did to my own detriment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mentioned this before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like I would push like,
and I mean push, I'd be like, check this
[SPEAKER_02]: weed, check this Chem Dog out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would get the same response.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't want to look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not interested in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any Sour Diesel or OG Kush?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, geez, man, you know,
no, I got a big fucking tub full of this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just look.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've already seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because they'd already seen the
fakes, you know, they've already seen the
[SPEAKER_02]: fake cuts and it was not just one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was many, you know, and it was
frustrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of heartbreaking because my
favorite weed wasn't good enough for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody else anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what was well, OG Kush and Sour
Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, if you like those,
you're going to like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I was in a bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kept myself there for better or for
worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just my perspective,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it makes sense totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned the Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to quickly ask you if the diesel
therapy seems like it's also got quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: cult following.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a powerhouse in terms of the
fan demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think it is about this cross
that seems to be grabbing people's
[SPEAKER_00]: attention?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, I mean, I don't know the back
end, but it seems extremely popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It surprised me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, when you make, you know,
if when you decide to make several
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses, you just never know what the what
the users are going to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that wouldn't surprise me a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just I think what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes and goes in popularity and it's
very popular right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you can go across the
board.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can look at all kinds of stuff that's
out there from what I can see that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: very desired right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't surprise me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's I mean, it's one of the best transits
ever, you know, come across the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't think it's anything
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the East Coast Sour Diesel is a great
representation of what Sour Diesel can be
[SPEAKER_02]: as far as like, you know, the way it
looks, the way it smells, the effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the East Coast Sour Diesel is a little
easier to deal with than the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I dare to say original Sour
Diesel, because that's probably not even
[SPEAKER_02]: the right way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's it's a little easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little shorter, a little stouter,
a little stockier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit less stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a lot less stretch,
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was what made it a good
candidate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, of course, I'm going to be I'm
always fucking around with Sour Diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if if I was like and I think that Kim
Fuego is going to give you all the traits
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're going to look for in Sour
Diesel, but maybe because it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: the name up front.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people want to, you know,
bring that fuel, that diesel, that fire,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, right back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, we're going to have to drill down
into some of the strains, because in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last chat we did, these weren't really
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people have accumulated their
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess on the topic of experimenting
with new crosses, a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: really keen on the Tropicana Cherry Cross
you've been posting about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've also done some hybrids with the
Apple Fritter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess in general, you could say that
you're bringing some some new genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: into the library, making some crosses with
some more sort of modern stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's been your take on this and what
crosses have sort of caught your eye?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to expand and kind of get more
experience with some of the newer crosses,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, or the newer, you know,
hybrids that are out there, like the ones
[SPEAKER_02]: you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like a lot of them, you know,
they're outside of my wheelhouse or
[SPEAKER_02]: outside of my, you know, the things that I
like about Kano's.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm OK with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm open to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I thought I was being kind of
unique, making those crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it looks like a lot of breeders
have been working with it, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: those two cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, you know, we've tested them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, our testing, you know,
we move at a certain pace.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a flow here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a flow and it might be a little
more slower than some.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tested it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so we've released them or we're
getting ready to release them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really happy with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I I get a little bit of
pushback from the chemists.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a little bit of pushback from some
dog heads out there about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we can't make everyone happy all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we want to, like, you know,
kind of cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an opportunity to take the old
school and cross it into the new school
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of show the new school with the
old schools all about and across,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and how things can be improved,
especially in the area of potency and also
[SPEAKER_02]: in flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've we succeeded there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, like, that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we're always a little late to
the game.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always have been.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those two are the result of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to release them later this
month, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you just referenced the
diehard chem heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the questions I have received a
few times over the past few years,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably one you get quite a lot is,
will people ever be able to get a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: chem line from you, maybe like a BX4,
BX5, just straight 91?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we did make a BX4 selected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mentioned this to folks before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was he was doing pretty good in the
crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was the one that we were probably
going to test a lot of his progeny,
[SPEAKER_02]: his brothers and sisters out and say,
OK, this is the chem BX that we're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to release.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in two thousand nineteen in
Sonoma County, most of the county and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: mean, literally almost all the county got
evacuated due to fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another fucking wildfire fueled by the El
Diablo winds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's his nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during that, of course, when you have
a genetic library and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: full growing mother state outside of
tissue culture, you're going to not be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to leave your home unless you want to
lose big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So although the emergency services,
sheriff's department and fire department
[SPEAKER_02]: and other firefighters were coming through
the area where we were keeping the
[SPEAKER_02]: library, I was keeping the library.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say we, I mean with me,
you know, but it's a habit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they we were basically hiding from the
emergency services and not evacuating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, you know, anybody listen to this,
you take those wildfires very seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those fires can be very fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a good advantage point and I had
rooted cuttings, you know, in the bathroom
[SPEAKER_02]: of my RV under a skylight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in case we had to go along with the
family photos, you know, and the glassware
[SPEAKER_02]: and all the things that matter in life
that you cannot replace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were ready to go, but I wanted
to keep my mom's going too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, however, we did lose BX for mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the seed still, but I've
decided to kind of put that on hold for
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do the feminized project that we
talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to I have some other crosses
that I've made that I'm testing out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for space, I'm just leaving that alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really feel like people are going
to be getting what they expect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the expectations of BX line
released as it is will be less because,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I said, I don't I'm not trying to
recreate Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to put it in seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying I always was trying to make a
stud that I could cross with my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: females that wasn't going to dominate
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But add potency to add flavor to add that
extra little fuel, you know, Kim fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you were to grow them out and I
have like you may you may it may you may
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like you're not getting what you
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because my goal was not to recreate Kim
dog and seed for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but to answer your question,
yeah, I will be doing that work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have to kind of start from where I
had started a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to have to gear it
towards that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a little bit different work
than creating the studs that I've that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've created in order to make the seeds
that I make the F1 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to kind of backtrack a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's more work involved than people
realize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to take all my BX three seeds and I
have BX four seeds to and just say this is
[SPEAKER_02]: the BX four.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't it's accurate, but it's also the
goal wasn't to get that to the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal was to create a stud that doesn't
overpower every female that comes in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you were to grow them out,
you'd be like, wait a minute, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so you have to back it up a little bit and
then you have to reselect for different
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can continue the work once
you find your selections with that goal in
[SPEAKER_02]: mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is like this is a lot more
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is basically starting over
in some ways, not completely starting
[SPEAKER_02]: over, but maybe going back to the BX three
generations, selecting for different
[SPEAKER_02]: traits, which certainly could happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, maybe taking it in a
different direction instead of going back
[SPEAKER_02]: into back cross, maybe start to create
filial generations that are geared towards
[SPEAKER_02]: that goal, which I think is be a better,
more like a more, you know, like what's
[SPEAKER_02]: the word?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's it, that would be a more
accurate way of doing it at this point,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like an IBL essentially,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is years and years and years
of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't really think that a BX
three or BX four can at this point is
[SPEAKER_02]: really useful to anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's going to be as great as
anyone thinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather select brother and sister and
move forward that way, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: from one of the generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't begun that work yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I backed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have begun the work, but I haven't like
narrowed it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is big work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this is important work to do
what you're asking or what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: suggesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just haven't.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to take that's a lifetime,
you know, and we are not going to do her
[SPEAKER_02]: dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to try to make a quick
buck on a BX.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not doing that, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to probably go a different
route.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to select from filial
generations F one, two, three,
[SPEAKER_02]: four, five, all the way wherever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing the background truthfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not really focused on it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not focused on it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great and a very comprehensive
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very much related.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one I got from two different of our
Patreon listeners was sort of in that same
[SPEAKER_00]: vein.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to know of what's currently
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think best embodies the cam
dog?
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone was saying, look, what's just
some that's going to give me a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea of what cam dog is, which strain
would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be Gorilla Fumay,
you know, not by design, but kind of by
[SPEAKER_02]: design.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also going to be double crush,
you know, which, you know, the road dog,
[SPEAKER_02]: like we talked about before, it's kind of
close relative, very close relative.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's kind of taken over in that
realm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say the double crush and
certainly the Gorilla Fumay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Gorilla Fumay, when someone asks me,
that's immediately the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're going to find a lot of
females that are very similar to the cam
[SPEAKER_02]: dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what I meant by that is that the
BX3 is not as cam doggy as the Gorilla
[SPEAKER_02]: Fumay of the best females.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that's the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Gorilla Fumay, I always tell
people that's cam dog in seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's as good as it's going to
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we can probably do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we haven't yet,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, just in the last question,
you were talking about the different cam
[SPEAKER_00]: dog males you have and playing around with
filial breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you mentioned to me that you've
been playing with a new male, a master
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us anything about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we one of our new we have a new release
coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucky Dog Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_02]: does, you know, sometime Christmasy,
maybe depending on if we can come up with
[SPEAKER_02]: some names.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not real good at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe we're good at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so we have what we have Grandmaster
Kim is our new one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the master Kush cross with the
cam dog BX3 male that we're all familiar
[SPEAKER_02]: with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we happen to have made F2s of that
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not really planning on doing any
extra work with that F2 male, the male
[SPEAKER_02]: that we use in the F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have him around still for obvious
reasons, because we want to be we are
[SPEAKER_02]: happy with that cross and we want to be
able to continue to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have it for that reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will he go to anything else when we
further work him?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really have a sense that we will
that I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just you know, we wanted to make that
F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we wanted to because we saw some
diversity, but we love the diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wanted to kind of narrow it down and
the F2 generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we narrowed it down from,
say, seven or eight phenos down to five,
[SPEAKER_02]: four, three, somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's more what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why we did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've done it with other cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I've made, but not the same success
that we're having with that guy and his
[SPEAKER_02]: partner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's kind of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's why we're making that
one, because we.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was one of the ones that was
going to go in the drawer that I mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: before, and we fell in love with some of
the phenos were like, OK, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: what do I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's make an F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let's see if we can narrow it
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did, you know, we're not going to
release the F2 yet because we want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to do more testing, but we're
ready to release the F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Grandmaster Chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think it's kind of catchy and we think
people are going to love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Master Kush is one you don't hear
of as much these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good to see that making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a similar sort of question for
you in a sense to the last one in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the recommendation of the chem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you recommend if you can't know
any specifics about the grow or any?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get to find out anything about
their preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only recommend one pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess in essence, what I'm saying is
what pack do you think is like broad
[SPEAKER_00]: appeal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are going to be into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your cookie cutter that you would
recommend?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say cookie cutter?
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like you're subliminally
trying to get the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that would be the schism.
[SPEAKER_02]: The schism is the only cut, the only seeds
I've made that have some of that cookie
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's got the OG KB crossed to the sour
band.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the the male in the in that cross,
the tits is what it's called.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the the the male to the the sour
band male using that cross is direct
[SPEAKER_02]: progeny, direct brother and sister to the
female that I used in the sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the Kim Fuego, the sour band
that's used in the Kim Fuego.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're directly related in that sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the schism is a cross between the tits
and the BX three male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so honestly, it's one of my favorites,
even though I'm not a big cookies guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love that fucking cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every I say this with 100 percent
confidence, every single schism seed that
[SPEAKER_02]: I ever popped and grew out, I would have
kept as a clone only.
[SPEAKER_02]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's me saying it 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I can't tell you why it hasn't been,
you know, the Kim Fuego is our most
[SPEAKER_02]: popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dog patch is up there for obvious
reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sour band.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that that schism is just off the
chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got both worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the new and the old mixed
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: All Finos, you know, like you're going to
be happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like it's interesting,
but that's the one that you're.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is one of the rare one as one of the
few people who's been lucky enough to try
[SPEAKER_00]: the rare tits cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's truly a special cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure that pairing is going to tick
a lot of boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do a let's do an adaptation of
one of the questions we asked you last
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in our last chat, I asked you if you
had a time machine, like what would you go
[SPEAKER_00]: back and get?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to modify that question a
little bit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say those El Diablo wins had
knocked out your entire library.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lost absolutely everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn up and I say, I've got the time
machine for you, but you can only bring
[SPEAKER_00]: back one pack of Lucky Dog seeds and
you're going to restart the company with a
[SPEAKER_00]: mail, presumably from this one pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What pack of seeds are you going to
restart the company with?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, you could do whatever you
want to restart, but I presume you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get a rake pack and get a mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got my head going here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that schism.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it depends on what I was trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I was going to go back to,
you know, working with Kim Dog and trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to wrap, you know, Kim Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seed form, it would be Gorilla Fumay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be, you know, it's special like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I tend to want to answer it
a different way, but that's probably the
[SPEAKER_02]: answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would want to do that because it's Kim
Dog, you know, and that's what I'm into.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love it and nothing,
you know, messes with my brain chemistry
[SPEAKER_02]: better, you know, and I think a lot of us
agree once we experience that,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's hard to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always going to be compared to
everything else as we move forward,
[SPEAKER_02]: so maybe that would be it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also like the Bohemian Highway comes
to mind, which has really literally been
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the, my least sought after,
which has always surprised me because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people who did buy it,
they always come back, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a farm up in Philo, California,
Mendocino County, who I don't know where
[SPEAKER_02]: they got packed from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't from me, but they got it from a
seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they reached out to me,
you know, and they're a farm, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're a legal farm and they wanted to
get quite a bit of bulk of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, finally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone recognized, you know, what this
is, this cut is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would say that that kind of makes
me think about that one, but I can't get
[SPEAKER_02]: away from the fact that I would want to
try to get back to the Kim Dog as fast as
[SPEAKER_02]: I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that would be the Gorilla Fumé,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, maybe there'll be some overlap
with the answer for this one, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time people are interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, yield for some people is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is the most commercially
viable in the sense that it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: compromise of potency, yield, all the
different aspects that would make it
[SPEAKER_00]: suitable for production?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, I guess I would try to,
you know, I would think about one that has
[SPEAKER_02]: a good, really solid yield, easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to compete in a negative
way with other strains or phenotypes you
[SPEAKER_02]: have in your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be, honestly, it would be the
Skizzle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't, you can't beat the potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a unique, the mother is so unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really pin her down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't say, oh, this is a cookie
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's got that in it, but it,
you know, oh no, this is a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sour diesel headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can't pin it down,
but it's got big yields.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, you know, resistant to
pressure, you know, pests and otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really consistent and easy to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very fast to find if, you know,
I, I was surprised by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it was going to be interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea that it was going to be so
consistent and stable as far as like
[SPEAKER_02]: traits that we all love, you know,
in, in this moment in cannabis in America
[SPEAKER_02]: or otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would have to say that one,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got me wondering what's on the
horizon for Lucky Dog Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: or more generally for Skunk BA.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've gone from seed to dispensary what
do you plan to do next?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like we, I see like a need for good,
clean, you know, legacy genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't have to necessarily mean
it's old.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what I mean, but like good
representations of what we all agree
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a lot of stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all of it's going to make it to the
next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all it's going to make it to the next
phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, like I'm all, I love doing lab
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love working under the hood.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not a biologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a scientist, but I know how to do
some of the stuff that they do,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like we are going to be introducing
VA labs to the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me start from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tissue culture, we all know what that
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all familiar with why we would want
to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all understand the reasons why it
exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: We either want to do long-term storage of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to clean up genetics, you know,
Mary Stem tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who knows what it's next, you know,
like there are some viruses that can be
[SPEAKER_02]: passed onto the Mary Stem rather easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so therefore that's not necessarily
going to be a cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, like, and I first did tissue
culture in 2005.
[SPEAKER_02]: Staten Island, as you call him,
gave me a kit and he said, figure this out
[SPEAKER_02]: and tell me, you know, tell me why this
is, useful to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did what he asked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what my answer was like, I can't
really tell you what it's useful for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say that transportation around the
globe would be definitely at the top of
[SPEAKER_02]: the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these, this is 2006.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are things, the issues that are
actually, you know, being like dealt with
[SPEAKER_02]: with tissue culture, propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't really present at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we weren't aware of some of the
viroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't, you know, like there's a bunch
of stuff, you know, like we were still in
[SPEAKER_02]: that genetic drift thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what the answer was.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been familiar with it on that
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done other work with other,
I guess you call them plants under sterile
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions, under flow hood, you know,
sterile air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I'm familiar with the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I'm doing is I want to like,
what I did was like, I wanted to find
[SPEAKER_02]: someone who, I have so many mothers,
you know, right now I have 70 mothers,
[SPEAKER_02]: 71, 71 different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my library, well, that's not a lot,
but it's a lot, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so biggest problem and it became
highlighted here at Lucky Dog Cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: that, geez, how much labor and time and
energy and resources go into keeping all
[SPEAKER_02]: those mothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about redundancy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Redundancy is how you keep plant alive for
30 fucking years.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the secret.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is redundancy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Redundancy is overdoing it, you know,
never relying on one, always relying on
[SPEAKER_02]: the redundancy system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, what I've learned here
is like, it's hard to describe how much
[SPEAKER_02]: energy goes into keeping that ground
healthy, vibrant, productive, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always at least two moms,
or it used to be four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we got it down to two, to give you an
example.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes up a lot of time, a lot of space
and a lot of resource.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't discover that in the last few
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a problem I've had for a
long time now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when tissue, nodal tissue culture
became an option for long-term storage,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very interested in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is is like who to do to work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of outside options,
you know, outsourcing, I think they call
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I looked around and every time I looked
into a company that does this type of
[SPEAKER_02]: work, I just couldn't quite pinpoint what
their goal was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, so when you want to store
your library and it's that vast and that
[SPEAKER_02]: large, you want to have peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason you want, the reason you're
even thinking about it is because you want
[SPEAKER_02]: to sleep at night without worrying about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to have life again, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to be able to go have some fun
with your girlfriend, you know what I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whatever, hang out with your family,
take your dog for a fucking trip,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It becomes a problem because, you know,
you can't really get that freedom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the flower production that takes
your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what keeps you up at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: If my flower crop goes to shit,
I don't lose any sleep over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just start over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can't do that with your library.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you lose something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gone forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whenever that happens to you,
it breaks your heart in 5,000 pieces and
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't put it back together ever again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to kind of mourn it and move
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, nodal tissue culture, as we moved into
the modern era, was something that was
[SPEAKER_02]: very interesting to me, very attractive to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But every time I went and looked at a
company that could help me with this,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I tend to do things on my own,
so there's that, but it's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't figure out what's going to
happen next.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you hear stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: This company did this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This scandal happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: This fucking bullshit happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be part of that because,
like I said, I just want to sleep well at
[SPEAKER_02]: night knowing my shit's safe, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are my kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are my dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my family.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to be safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I just couldn't trust the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, okay, if I want to do this,
I have to do it myself, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the decision I want to make,
but that's the decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where we're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where VA labs is popping up
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where it was born of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took it upon myself to learn the
process, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nodal tissue culture, Mary's stem tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure, synthetic seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things aren't that useful to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're part of the work, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm thinking to myself, well,
maybe there's other preservationists out
[SPEAKER_02]: there that feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't seem to break free of the chain
around their damn neck because of their
[SPEAKER_02]: mother's stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their mother block has just taken up all
their life and time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, maybe I can learn the
process, share the process, and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: key.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to teach other folks how to do
this, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the cannabis has missed,
had a close call with, say, like hoplite
[SPEAKER_02]: and viroid, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It snuck into all of our gardens and
almost ruined many people's libraries in
[SPEAKER_02]: the silent of the night, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a silent killer, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, what I saw was there's
like a use for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, storing people's genetics
is obviously a service that we're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: provide and that we're happy to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also feel that it's going to be
better to teach people the process,
[SPEAKER_02]: teach companies the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who cares about it, we can help
them with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be doing, you know,
genetic storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be cleaning up genetics,
you know, all the typical stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also we're going to be teaching people
how to do it themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we realize that that's where the,
that's the biggest need, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to like be a company in
New York and come out to Montana or
[SPEAKER_02]: California to get your cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not practical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is practical?
[SPEAKER_02]: Having your own, you know, your own team
learn the process, master the process,
[SPEAKER_02]: feel confident, and then you can store
your own genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that do for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: That propels cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That keeps cannabis' genetic pool clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it allows anyone who comes across any
problems to have the proper skills to do
[SPEAKER_02]: something about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, we, we've been known
to have pretty good reputation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not going to fuck you over.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want nothing from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already got what you got.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to store here, we can do
that for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to be honest, with Lucky Dog Cannabis,
what this is, it's a licensed facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a licensed business in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I believe personally that
national legalization is just a few days
[SPEAKER_02]: away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming quicker than anyone realizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once that happens, interstate
commerce, when it comes to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: is going to become, going to become part
of the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that means is that, like,
it doesn't matter what state we're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all going to be able to help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be able to work with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the goal is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then furthermore, we want to be
able to provide clean, verified clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: How?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're going to be testing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be testing it every two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be testing mother stock,
your mother stock, if you choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're ready to come out of tissue
culture and be integrated into,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, standard propagation practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make sure that before that
step happens, whatever it is, whether it
[SPEAKER_02]: be ours or yours or whatever it is,
it's going to be clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're going to make sure of it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, the testing has come a
long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, now we're taking root.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're testing the roots in the
first few inches of soil at different
[SPEAKER_02]: locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we are investing in,
we have a QPCR machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are able, the tests for QPCR
machines are pretty readily available for
[SPEAKER_02]: hoplite and viral, for instance,
and other pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as, as well as sex testing,
we'll be offering all those services.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we feel like that is a good focus,
focal point for us to further take the
[SPEAKER_02]: next step with cannabis, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, there's other ways of doing
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other folks doing it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it's just tough to find
someone who really gets it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and understands like where we're going
with all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we feel, I feel like we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've always been about the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always will be about the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, if there's, you know,
a service that is worth money,
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not exactly why we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want to make sure the cannabis
makes it to its next step.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I've been doing the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I'm going to continue
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I saw all this kind of
opportunity or, you know, like kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: this vision to do it, I just couldn't,
it's just passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like my passion just went right to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the work we've been waiting for.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been in this lull between what we've
done and what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in all honesty, we could probably
spend a whole episode just delving into
[SPEAKER_00]: the specifics of it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have to keep our eyes open for VA
labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sort of on the tail end of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a really good Patreon question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to run by you before we wrap
things up, which is basically along the
[SPEAKER_00]: lines of what does Staten Island think
about the fact that you've been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: make a really successful company off the
back of ChemDog?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does he ever talk about wanting to do his
own breeding or start his own company?
[SPEAKER_02]: He is going to be opening a nursery in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so where we're at right now,
he's like, he would like to get lucky dog,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, breeder cuts in the nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of where we're at,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's he we all played our role.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, none of us like did anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all collectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we did was we preserved one of the
greatest, you know, the queen of
[SPEAKER_02]: contemporary cannabis is what we've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we did that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I think that we all are
aware of the role we played in the bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for any one of us to take,
like, you know, a fucking victory lap
[SPEAKER_02]: about what each one individual has done
would be kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not in the spirit of what we're
trying to do, and he gets that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so I think that that like we're
we're talking about that nursery and how
[SPEAKER_02]: to get unique genetics and, of course,
lucky dog, you know, cuts there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's that's kind of what I
would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't speak for other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that that's pretty close to
what you would hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's really cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, as time goes by,
people can get access to some killer
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder cuts through his nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other Patreon questions we got
from a fellow Virginian was what area of
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia is Skunk VA from?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as legalization rolls out further,
would you ever consider moving back to
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always dreamed to sell legal cannabis in
Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Richmond, the south side of
Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up on the south side of Richmond on
the south side of the James River.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chesterfield County was where I grew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did I did spend some time in Oregon
Hill in Richmond back when it was a weird
[SPEAKER_02]: place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not weird now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of gentrified.
[SPEAKER_02]: But south side of Richmond is what we call
it the south side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chesterfield County, you know,
I would definitely not consider moving
[SPEAKER_02]: back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Virginia is a beautiful place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the most beautiful places in
the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: George Washington National Park is one of
the most beautiful places you could ever
[SPEAKER_02]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so many other spots,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an interesting place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a diverse place in some ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis has always been a really
popular thing in Virginia, oddly enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's you know, you get a lot of
trouble for it over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I would ever move back
there, but I would like to kind of do what
[SPEAKER_02]: your listeners suggesting and kind of be
part of the, you know, evolution of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis there because I'm from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always like every time I've ever been
busted, I'm always thinking, you
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfucker, I might hire your kids one
day, you know, because I know they care
[SPEAKER_02]: about weed more than you hate it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that that's a little bit of a
motivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But also, yeah, I'm from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like every thing that happened in
my life stemmed from, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing up there just kind of
coincidentally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, Virginia is I think everyone
knows now Virginia is well known for its
[SPEAKER_02]: contribution to cannabis in the United
States through the dark ages, especially.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm so happy to see that my brothers
and my sisters there are able to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, more freely express themselves
in their love for cannabis without the
[SPEAKER_02]: fear of what could happen, the
consequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would love that, you know,
I'd love to be part of any kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, thing that picks up and happens
there, you know, it's a slow moving
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Legalization there just the way they're
doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's happening, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I go there to visit, because I
have gone to some seed events there and I
[SPEAKER_02]: go back and I love my people back there
like they're good to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I I just love their passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I recognize their passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same passion that I came up with in
spite of the law and spite of the
[SPEAKER_02]: consequences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still see it and I so much love it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I would love to be part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think I'm sure I'll ever live
there, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not big on the humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't when I grew up there and I'm not
still now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be a big one for me,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of our listeners wanted to know,
what is the sort of considerations that go
[SPEAKER_00]: into making a hybrid for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they specifically reference that the
Pine Soul Go-GOG is a cut they love.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were a bit caught off guard.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't exactly expecting you to make
a hybrid with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they thought, oh, wow, there's maybe
all these cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't necessarily thinking he might
work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just you liking the flower and
going, this will work well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what goes into you picking a cut to
breed with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's just it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the I fall in love with the mom,
the cut, and I want to see what else we
[SPEAKER_02]: can do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a bit of experiment,
experimentation at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it starts with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts with I like the cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you find a cut that you just
want to see what happens, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's happened a few times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, it's the you know,
like the the Sunshine Biscuits is a good
[SPEAKER_02]: example of one where I absolutely love the
mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the the flavor potency is missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not that strong, you know,
even for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't need like overpowering
cannabis, but it's just not that strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a quick, blasting,
you know, high effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the flavor is just phenomenal,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that one's an outlier because of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like maybe we can improve this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like the strength of what we've
made is, you know, more in tune with what
[SPEAKER_02]: we think it should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not the cut, but just cannabis in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it maintains that flavor, the
beautiful colors, you know, the experience
[SPEAKER_02]: you have with cherry AK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an outlier of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, it's like,
oh, I love this cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is work with it and see what happens,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, most of the time,
we're not happy with the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most maybe maybe everyone,
maybe most people would be, but I'm not,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like if there's too many damn
phenos, it's just it's not what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it's too dominated by chem
dog, that's also not what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that case, we may try the BX2 male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's not where it is,
then it just goes in the drawer,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and we'll deal with it some
other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of types of work we can do
with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we're trying to do at Lucky Dog
now, that's not really in tune with what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it goes in the drawer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not trying to sell a guy in Texas,
for instance, or Arkansas or Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let's take Mississippi because
they're actually medical now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, Georgia and then and then
like confusing with a bunch of phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it could be disappointing,
you know, and we don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're trying to do now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we got a lot of stuff to work with
and maybe our goals will be slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: different, you know, but that's kind of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well thought out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our final patron submitted questions
before we do a few quick fire ones is can
[SPEAKER_00]: you tell us a little bit about the Royal
Apple?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made by our buddy J Trees and used in
the Zephyr.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess people don't really see it
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you describe that mother for
people that mother it had?
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I got interested in using that
mother was so I met him at the 2017
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald Cup and he gave me some seeds,
you know, and they were interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the Long Valley Royal we're all
familiar with that man brought to work and
[SPEAKER_02]: then cross with the sour apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I popped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, they weren't like what I hope.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was one pheno that had this
amazing color purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't really have a lot of
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to like have visually visually
different stimulating kind of cross,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to kind of like give people who
are into that an option at Lucky Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was where I started.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't have the structure didn't have
say the potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a prime candidate to be cross
with the BX3.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked it into a pollination that I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was really pleased with the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the color, the structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything was improved.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it had that pedigree and also that
extra fuel chem just, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: sticky icky just destroy you kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we went with it, you know,
you know, that's pretty much the story
[SPEAKER_02]: started off with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a visually appealing flower,
you know, just to see what comes from it,
[SPEAKER_02]: because oftentimes deep purple strains
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh, you're pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavor, you know, the oftentimes those
things are missing with the Zephyr.
[SPEAKER_02]: We nailed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we had those pink purple hues,
but we had this fucking dripping trichrome
[SPEAKER_02]: production and just like amazing flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fell in love with it, you know,
and very consistent, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like two phenos, you know, really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear that JTree's work made it
into the library.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on to our final questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll juggle it up a little bit this time
so we don't repeat any from last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: First one is what's the single most
memorable cannabis experience you've had?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't necessarily have to be like
the most potent hit you ever took,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just for whatever reason, it just
sticks with you is like that was just a
[SPEAKER_00]: great memory and cannabis was involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did share with you that joint that I
smoked in 1991, and that's definitely at
[SPEAKER_02]: the top of the list, but I'll give you
another one in Grateful Deadland.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would find what they call backstage
bud backstage, but it didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a particular strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was what they wanted, you know,
as they, you know, came out in the parking
[SPEAKER_02]: lot and searched around, you know,
they got a lot of clout, so they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to see things that I'm not going to see,
you know, even though I'm out there every
[SPEAKER_02]: day, they would come out, you know,
for a minute, you know, I know who Steve
[SPEAKER_02]: Parrish is, you know, you want to see some
good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Steve Parrish, he's the roadie for,
you know, a roadie for the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was Jerry Garcia's right hand man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like a bouncer slash guitar,
polisher slash roadie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he did it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if he was the one,
but I know he loves weed and he would come
[SPEAKER_02]: out and you'd see him out there every now
and again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, mostly he was working,
but he had a thing called backstage,
[SPEAKER_02]: but and this is the backstage,
but wasn't the same as yesterday,
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't the same as the last set of shows
in the other city.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what they're smoking tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was this one particular
backstage, but that was, I think we were,
[SPEAKER_02]: we were in Oakland, California and I
believe it was December and I believe it
[SPEAKER_02]: was in December of 1992.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this weed was indoor weed from
Minnesota, I believe Minneapolis or St.
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul area.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff looked like someone had taken
sugar water and sprayed it on it and let
[SPEAKER_02]: it dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like rock candy, you know,
and it was almost fake looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: The buds were kind of sparse.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were definitely like coated in this
like glassy, like tri-chrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just oozing with resin,
you know, and the jars were all eighths,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mason jars that were sealed somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know how they would have done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like when you open it,
you hear the pop, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a, like a canned jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that stuff stands out in my memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know what the strain was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just, it was backstage,
but, and then someone I knew, my little
[SPEAKER_02]: buddy, little Mike, he found he's rest in
peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not with us anymore, but he had a
knack for networking that I've never seen
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere in my life to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he somehow came across, you know,
a box of these eighths and Mason jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he, you know, this is the backstage,
but we didn't question that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was phenomenal and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that always will stick out my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 1992, you know, it's a long,
so I would say, you know, that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that memories endured, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next one, if I'm going to drop you off
on a desert Island and you can only take
[SPEAKER_00]: three strains with you to grow for the
rest of eternity, what three are you
[SPEAKER_00]: taking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kim dog, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour diesel and something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make me pick three tits.
[SPEAKER_00]: My selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of changes do you think are
needed to help keep the OGs in the system
[SPEAKER_00]: and not being forced out?
[SPEAKER_02]: The OGs are not business people,
business people and OGs, as you say,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're very different animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say like to the death,
protect the homegrown to the death,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like increase the numbers
allowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how many tomato plants am I allowed
to have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Endless.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why would Canada be different,
you know, and right now in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States, the biggest problem I see right
now is the federal government is gearing
[SPEAKER_02]: up for national legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they doing that right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: What they're doing is they're preemptively
creating a regulatory system that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to affect us all as national legalization
comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who did the federal government ask?
[SPEAKER_02]: They asked liquor producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They asked beer producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all know that we that those that
industry feels falsely that they're at
[SPEAKER_02]: odds with cannabis, that cannabis is
direct competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I both know we discussed it last
night over dinner that that's not the
[SPEAKER_02]: case, that cannabis and say wine,
beer, they go to hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually complement each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I'm a beer, you know,
if I'm away into beer, which I don't drink
[SPEAKER_02]: beer anymore, but it was, you know,
like I the same kind of experience I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: having with craft beers is the same kind
of experience I'm going to have with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people who are making the rules,
they get it wrong every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're getting ready to give it
really wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: The federal government has put together a
regulatory committee or whatever you would
[SPEAKER_02]: call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's based on like the makers of
Molson, you know, Kentucky cheap bourbon
[SPEAKER_02]: and others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's mostly alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's to me, I think it's important
that we don't just stand by and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, cannabis is like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It intoxicates you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's as far as it goes on on on a public
safety standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as like the way we view wine and
craft beers and flavor, that is very much,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, relating to cannabis and how we
perceive it and experience it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how could the federal government
understand that?
[SPEAKER_02]: How could any of these people who feel
like they're in direct competition,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, people have 50 bucks this week
to spend on their vice, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the liquor and alcohol industry says we
want all 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you put them in charge of developing
a regulatory system for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to make sure that you get
the 50 bucks over here still.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That means they're going to like push us
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the OGs, as you say,
it's already happened in many states like
[SPEAKER_02]: California, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like that would be the focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the place that we have to
stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can't do it after.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to do it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because as we all know, you can't change
what they already do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so difficult to take decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is the time to get involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is the time to come out of the
shadows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is the time to push back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now is the time for us to say what
regulation for cannabis should and
[SPEAKER_02]: shouldn't be.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want no regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all want a safe product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want Molson to tell us what
that safety is.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know anything about safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their gig has been you know, like safety
got circumvented around their industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their industry is not safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to have a nice little drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we all you like wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like wine, you know, and others.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like bourbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I appreciate good bourbon,
good Kentucky bourbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, you know, it's just doesn't
translate the liquor industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: the alcohol industry, let's say their
regulation doesn't translate to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if you talk to a policy politician,
to them, it clearly does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's two vices that people spend money on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to tax the fuck out of it and
we're going to make money on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: To them, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this isn't like adversarial.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just they're uneducated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't understand cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now is the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a big cannabis producer out
there, you know, you know, get off your
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking ass and stop counting your fucking
money in your jet and get involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the ones that are going to speak
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so since you're going to speak for me,
make sure you speak clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And accurately for me, I am an OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's many of us out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to do it right, you do it
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But get involved, you know, take your
fucking millions of dollars you made off
[SPEAKER_02]: the legacies that many of us produce and
fucking put it where it belongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it where your mouth is and stop
bullshitting and get involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will get involved too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't have that power.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have that that that pull.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you do do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let it fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it may work out for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll figure out a way to work out for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what about the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the culture?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the rest of us?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, get involved because now is the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already the United States Congress
has already passed a bill to allow the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory system to be developed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the people, the players that they
invited in, they're the wrong people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not the right people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to take it out of your
pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to take it from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and furthermore, protect the home
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't feel threatened by the home grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a lot of these big producers are
pretty adamant against the home grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It disgusts me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me sick to my stomach.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get it if that's your position.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are against the home grower because
you want to make your little money off the
[SPEAKER_02]: aid, you don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need to wake up and you need to
act right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you need to like put your money where
the culture is.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one makes beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one makes beer or liquor at home for
consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hobby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a niche.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the main reason why I think
that's, you know, maybe your point that
[SPEAKER_02]: the home grower is the backbone of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the home grower has learned,
you know, what you learn from growing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis is is one of the most important
lessons you can learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be self reliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need everything that you can
buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually produce some of the
things that you consume.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis would be at the top of the lesson
list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you when you discover that you
can, you know, when you fall in love with
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, it's at the top of the list of
things you love.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like, yeah, I'm okay with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're you love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you don't love it,
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you do love it, you become
passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you grow your own cannabis,
it opens up a door that you never had
[SPEAKER_02]: open.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can be passionate about so many
things that you consume that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: produce yourself, you know, at home for
you and your family.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a fuck if it's San Pedro.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't give a shit if it's
tomatoes, kale, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You find you discover through cannabis,
just like I did, that you can be in
[SPEAKER_02]: control and empowered by what you consume
and producing yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that should always be the focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without that, there's no real
legalization, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the final question, we're going to
jazz it up a bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to give me a quick summary of
what a day in the life of Skunk VA would
[SPEAKER_00]: be in 10 years time if everything goes to
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you wake up in a in Malibu with a
jacuzzi out front?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's a day for you in 10 years time
if everything goes well?
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a long time from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm glad you didn't ask what my
day like is today because nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_02]: hear about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say, you know, what I talked
about, like, you know, pulling off some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these goals, like being like, you know,
how do I say, reintroducing, injecting
[SPEAKER_02]: into the cannabis culture, the old school,
you know, how did this start?
[SPEAKER_02]: Never letting the user, the grower,
the big producer forget, where did all
[SPEAKER_02]: this come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did we get to this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that like the clean,
you know, keeping dedicated to the
[SPEAKER_02]: further, you know, furthering of the plant
itself, whether it be cleaning it from
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens, whether it be creating new
practices for people to avoid pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: from pathogens and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's good work, you know,
and I'm happy with that, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to be, you know, part of that
movement, you know, and I am going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: part of that movement, but I would like it
to be successful like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, what I said about
when the United States goes national
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization, it's one of the biggest
things that's going to happen on earth,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine cannabis producers in the United
States exporting cannabis to China,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine a stressed out society like China,
you know, feeling some relief from their
[SPEAKER_02]: day-to-day like we do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, that would be it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where I'll be, Malibu, I don't know about
all that, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been to Malibu.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, it's not for me, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, I certainly wouldn't want to
have to work as hard as I am in 10 years
[SPEAKER_02]: from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm only 50 years old next year,
you know, so I feel like I work too hard a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be, you know, personally,
that would be something that I would want
[SPEAKER_02]: to go for it more, kind of feel like,
all right, you know, we fought the battle
[SPEAKER_02]: and like we've made some progress and
let's pass it on to the next generation
[SPEAKER_02]: and let's hang out and chill with our dogs
and if I can smoke a fatty on the beach
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere, maybe, or on the top of a
mountain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as cannabis and the culture
goes, I just would like to, I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: it's being the, you know, you say OGs has
kind of gotten, it's starting to feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: a relic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's starting to feel like the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to be reinjected.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're out here still.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still influencing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still working, you know,
so that part I would say I would want to
[SPEAKER_02]: be part of that to reinject that back into
the culture that, hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: young man or woman, this is where this all
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where it all came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what had to happen for you to
enjoy this plant, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome to hear that even in 10
years time, you're still serving the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings us just about to the end of
it for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any comments or shout outs you
want to throw in the mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as always, a huge thank you for

[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I really do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are one of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You perpetuate the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You perpetuate the facts, the realness of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so easy for, for the big players to
gloss over some of the things that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they don't even notice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it never occurred to them and you
keep the live and we all appreciate you
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're too kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's reciprocal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that brings us to the ends of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much again.
