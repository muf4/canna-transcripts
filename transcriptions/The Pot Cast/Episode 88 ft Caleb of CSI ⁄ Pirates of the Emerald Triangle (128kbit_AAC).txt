[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining us or the Humboldt
pirate either or the real Jack Sparrow How
[SPEAKER_02]: you been since we last spoke just staying
busy as always I Don't think anyone can
[SPEAKER_02]: deny that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you been working on recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been doing a lot of a
reproducing of All the original lands I
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduced, you know Seven eight nine ten
years ago as far as the the regular pirate
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff And then just keeping busy Trying to
make you know a whole catalog of you know
[SPEAKER_00]: s ones for preservation and you know some
hybrids for fun You know a bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that a man of all tastes So let's
let's touch on both the most recent
[SPEAKER_02]: regular line you've done if I'm not
mistaken Is that the DC hybrid or or do
[SPEAKER_02]: you consider that still in progress?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, oh I reproduced the DC Reproduced the
pine tar Kush or not the pine tar the
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas pine tar is actually coming up
soon And then the Burmese I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: Burmese is mmm one I I don't know it's
it's one of the most Difficult ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know because sative is Hard not easy
pure sativa's And then uh, then I I have
[SPEAKER_02]: Panama on deck so, you know Wow,
are you starting to tap into your sativa
[SPEAKER_02]: side of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've always had it's just and
they're a pain You know any of these you
[SPEAKER_00]: know pure pure sativa's that take 20 24
weeks They don't even start flowering for
[SPEAKER_00]: six weeks You don't have a seed set until
eight weeks deep Yeah, I was about to say
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the photos of the I think it was the
Burmese you posted up and I Could have
[SPEAKER_02]: been week two in my garden, but I think
you said it was week six or seven or eight
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was probably close to eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Wow, what's that Burmese like and
where did it come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: so the Burmese I Reproduced that Oh,
I don't know maybe eight or nine years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget but uh The the seeds my buddy had
been given were from the late 90s and they
[SPEAKER_00]: had sat in his fridge forever and He
passed them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like 70 seeds or something and he
had gotten them from You know through the
[SPEAKER_00]: grapevine from this dude who went by the
handle preservation, dude Or Colonel
[SPEAKER_00]: Colonel cosmic I think But this dude was
you know really well known around like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know central California the Bay Area
and You know, he preserved a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know exactly how far back
they date before him But they're at least
[SPEAKER_00]: you know mid 90s if not, you know,
he probably had him for quite a while You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, but he passed on probably Damn near
20 years ago, maybe 15, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's been a while Yeah, wow, and you
mentioned it's like one of those like
[SPEAKER_02]: really really long flowering sativa's What
what do you think you could compare it to
[SPEAKER_02]: like is it is the effect and the smell
like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not dissimilar to other plants that go
that long or is like how would you
[SPEAKER_02]: describe it for someone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's definitely like a type You
know, well, it's a it's an old-school tie
[SPEAKER_00]: type of plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm Damn and and does it have that same
sort of effect like real uplifting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's it's right in line with
all that kind of stuff for sure That's
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had a fan submitted question
and they said they were thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: pulling the trigger on the Burmese and
they wanted to ask you how many packs do
[SPEAKER_02]: you think they should run through to find
like what you would consider one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: better plants I mean You know,
I'm not gonna go all Tom Hill and say you
[SPEAKER_00]: need a hundred But I'd say, you know just
my personal recommendation just just do
[SPEAKER_00]: one and then you know, give it a try and
because They're they're not easy to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by themselves I mean Especially if
you haven't grown sativa's before I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: you you can flower out a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally totally maybe just yeah,
maybe just get over the initial hurdle
[SPEAKER_02]: before we go to Tom Hill on it That makes
sense for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Guess as a follow-up, I'd be interested
in general when you offer your
[SPEAKER_02]: preservation lines I love how you do like
21 seeds or more in a pack Is that because
[SPEAKER_02]: you are trying to encourage People to like
do a little digging or is it just because
[SPEAKER_02]: you get more seeds or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know, I was I was a member of you
know, plenty of these like preservation
[SPEAKER_00]: groups, you know land race groups,
you know online for years and You always
[SPEAKER_00]: would see people sprouting four seeds or
ten seeds and I'm like, no, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean hell Honestly, I'd like to you
know, just do hundred packs, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum hundred packs but the reality is
Not everybody has a space or the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a hundred at a time So I do 21 because
I'm like well at least make your selection
[SPEAKER_00]: from you know a bigger amount or if you're
gonna open pollinate You know do it from a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger amount, you know And I know I know
a hundred's not perfect, you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand's better but you know,
I mean Yeah, you know, we're just trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to preserve as many of the genes as
possible for future generations
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially You know, yeah hugely hugely
and I can definitely get on board with the
[SPEAKER_02]: sentiment of you know You see people doing
three or four seed open polls and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh no That'll definitely narrow it
down to what you want or don't want That's
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean while you mentioned the Burmese You
know, it's like a tie type plan and we
[SPEAKER_02]: just quickly touched on Tom I'd love to
ask would you have any interest in running
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom's I mean, I think Tom's doing a pretty
damn good job with with that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd really like to You know see him after
he gets his open pollination his most
[SPEAKER_00]: recent open pollination done I'd like to
see him actually get in there and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Directionally go somewhere with it and get
that ratio of one in a hundred Maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little little lower one in ten.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Would be appreciative I'm looking for
that mythical haze clone and I just Sadly
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have enough space Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I listened to your interview
with him and I really liked it and III
[SPEAKER_00]: related a lot because It seems,
you know Tom and I we've always tended to
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve but we've we've never done a
whole lot on like Directionally just
[SPEAKER_00]: narrowing it down and you know making
something that's just you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know really high quality Out of the
things we've preserved, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're always on to the next thing,
you know, so I'm trying to take notes
[SPEAKER_02]: You're too kind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for listening to that one and and
look, you know I feel like you touched on
[SPEAKER_02]: a really Focal feeling that a lot of
growers have which I try to relate to
[SPEAKER_02]: people and I say Sometimes as you're
getting towards the end of a project or
[SPEAKER_02]: like a harvest or whatever You're almost
like checked out of those plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're more Invested in like what's about
to cut you like I'm about to flip these
[SPEAKER_02]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna be bomb Oh, especially if
it's 24 weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Where'd the year go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, yeah That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I mean and you know, we're talking
about Tom You did you did the deep chunk
[SPEAKER_02]: project any any interesting takeaways or
observations you made while doing that
[SPEAKER_02]: one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely found some some Some plants I
didn't really You know, I hadn't noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: before in previous reproductions,
um, I think I just you know in my old age
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm paying more attention moving a little
slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and There was some there was some
Some sniffs that I wasn't expecting just
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a little little skunky to him
and I was like, hmm, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know It could blend well with some
things That's exciting to hear I would
[SPEAKER_02]: love to ask you specifically I know you've
been posting some really impressive
[SPEAKER_02]: looking photos of some deep chunk males
You've been playing around with I think
[SPEAKER_02]: you've narrowed them down a little bit
Were there any specific traits or things
[SPEAKER_02]: you were looking for with that selection
or how did you whittle them down?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for stinky ones and you
know, of course frosty ones, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I asked Tom, you know, what do you
go for in those males and he's like I like
[SPEAKER_00]: the frosty ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know You know, I was I was you
know, making sure I got those ones
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful beautiful beautiful and do you
think that like People are keen for the
[SPEAKER_02]: deep chunk or do you think that it's sort
of a bit difficult for a lot of people to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I mean in its own its own regard
It's it's just as difficult as like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the sativas, you know,
it's a short stumpy Super slow growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know inbred inbred indica,
you know And I mean anytime you get
[SPEAKER_00]: anything inbred, you know, whether it's
indica or sativa Yeah, you know It's not
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not the easiest to grow,
you know, so Certainly and and how would
[SPEAKER_02]: you like compare and contrast it to say
the mazar line because I've been eyeing
[SPEAKER_02]: that one off and I'm like, oh I kind of
think I want to run the mazar.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they different?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um the mazar it tends to like Grow a
little faster or a bit faster really have
[SPEAKER_00]: have more distance between the nodes and
more be like a traditional type of just
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like a Hindu Kush type of thing
That definitely You know not the monster,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know fan leaves of the deep chunk and
the super stoutness and all that You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's more of a regular indica Type
versus deep deep chunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah super Super indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I definitely get you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can understand that I'm I can't remember
who it was but someone was on the show and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were saying that like the Afghani
sort of archetypal structure and flavors
[SPEAKER_02]: and effects that people in say America and
all over the world think of is sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: Maza type plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you say you agree with that in
general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely you know More of the norm
type, you know Afghani indica type plant
[SPEAKER_00]: there were there was even a a couple of
them in there when I reproduced them last
[SPEAKER_00]: that Were a little bit reminiscent of say
like a Baba Kush, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, no Baba for sure, you know,
but definitely, you know, and then you see
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot with you know Some of the you
know Hindu Kush, you know Afghani Indicas
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that, you know, you know that that
look of a plant so Yeah, nice and and I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean like if we're talking about say the
Maza or the deep chunk or really any of
[SPEAKER_02]: the lines We've touched on so far Have you
found any like really standout keepers or
[SPEAKER_02]: are you more just looking to open
pollinate and you're not looking?
[SPEAKER_02]: To find a keeper per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh There's definitely been been ones that
you know If I had more time more space
[SPEAKER_00]: more help, I definitely you know be
keeping some of these I'm terrible at
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping stuff like I'll keep them for I
don't know two months six months and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just like you know, my my mother
rooms are already overflowing I Gotta make
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions and if I have seeds,
you know, I tend to let let a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers go So yeah, no, it makes sense and
you sort of touched on a question I wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to ask you which is that I can't count how
many breeders have just like offhandedly
[SPEAKER_02]: made the comment being like God damn the
amount of work Caleb does is insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Wanted to ask how do you do it with just
on your own because I know you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: a ton of help Like how many sites you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you how do you like get sleep?
[SPEAKER_00]: I Do have a very small crew of dedicated
helpers, um, you know, I've got I'd say
[SPEAKER_00]: three three helpers that you know put in
some serious time and You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I run Five right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I downscale it a couple years ago,
but I run five breeding rooms two rags and
[SPEAKER_00]: three fams and You know, I Try to stay up
on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do pretty good mostly Yeah, truly it
really is honestly inspiring to see how
[SPEAKER_02]: much work you put out and you know because
I feel like sometimes it's easy to drag
[SPEAKER_02]: your feet on projects and to like,
you know just stick around and there have
[SPEAKER_02]: been times in my life where I've been more
productive than maybe I am currently and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I Look at you and I'm like damn
that's that's honestly the goal It would
[SPEAKER_00]: be nice if you know I only had one or two
projects That that kind of sounds good to
[SPEAKER_00]: me lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a crowdfund some help so you can
go on a holiday I Really want to I really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to head to Australia one of these
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Look, I would love to have you here and
let me tell you there's a lot of really
[SPEAKER_02]: nice CSI cuts floating around Australia
like the one that jumps to mind
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately is I know that there's a
really nice lemon tree headband That my
[SPEAKER_02]: buddy found it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, beautiful all day everyday
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I bet I bet yeah I'm a big fan of that
lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes and the headband Well before we get
there I want to quickly ask because we've
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of been talking about some of the
older projects you've been doing Can you
[SPEAKER_02]: give me any insights on the use Becky Stan
line?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that came from Charlie Garcia and
That was from the original seeds he
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduced before he out across it to the
northern lights and I Got those or we got
[SPEAKER_00]: those I think through Bodhi So Charlie had
given them to This one cat who had then
[SPEAKER_00]: given them to Bodhi and then I Ended up
getting them from Bodhi and reproducing
[SPEAKER_00]: them gave a bunch to Bodhi gave a bunch to
Charlie, you know But it's just a it's
[SPEAKER_00]: another old-school, you know indica Kind
of a leg year indica plant, but just super
[SPEAKER_00]: super frosty hash plant style like like
When you hear people talk about hash plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you get these hash plant clones
that have no frost But that was Becky you
[SPEAKER_00]: could call it a hash plant Because it's a
frosty hash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know But yeah That that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely one of the more rarer ones
I think and so it definitely has a bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: allure to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost like touches on that Same
interesting vibe when people see Bodhi's
[SPEAKER_02]: ancient og and they're like, oh Iranian
that sounds intriguing like from a part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the world that you just never hear from
you know Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there you go Well the last sort of
mutant one I was hoping to quickly touch
[SPEAKER_02]: on because I know you got a bit of
experience with it is Over the past few
[SPEAKER_02]: years you've done slash collabed on some
cool Australian bastard cannabis stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that experience been like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Has that changed your outlook on things at
all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I I did a lot of work with
it for a few years there and It actually
[SPEAKER_00]: it taught me a lot it taught me more about
breeding than anything in the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically anything ABC is gonna be in a
recessive genetic and You can breed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know these recessive on Ever
everything, you know, you grow out a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred, you know f1 f2 f3m and you can
breed those recessive But at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day most of those recessive Aren't the
best plants, you know and ABC is a tough
[SPEAKER_00]: one I mean the only the only one I've ever
seen that, you know, really looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: halfway decent plant is you know You know
homeboy over in your neck of the woods,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know who I'm talking about I was gonna
give him a shout-out bin chicken.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout-out Dooliga Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean he has a he has an ABC that looks
like a damn normal plant Yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's a lot of like interesting
genetics in there as well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hybrid of a hybrid of a hybrid
Yeah, so Okay, and like I mean as a
[SPEAKER_02]: follow-up you made like a bunch of cool
hybrids I remember there was like a TK
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a cheese hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a there's a number of them I
don't want to do disservice by forgetting
[SPEAKER_02]: one or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll just cap it there but Did any of
them end up doing what you hoped where
[SPEAKER_02]: like you got a lot of influence?
[SPEAKER_02]: From that regular mother on the ABC type
plant or it was more harder than just
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so I honestly think I chose wrong
At least with the ones I did I took a TK
[SPEAKER_00]: You know times ABC to f4 and I found in
the f2 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found You know a plant that was an OG
Kush ABC plant right But then when I bred
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the f3 You couldn't even find any of
that og Kush You know as far as turps go
[SPEAKER_00]: you could find the look sure but you
couldn't there I didn't get any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: turps, you know, so There's a few ways,
you know, I could backtrack on that one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them would be to Make a feminized,
you know with an og Kush, you know type
[SPEAKER_00]: and then breed into the problem with ABC
is it's always been turpentine Dom like
[SPEAKER_00]: many many many sativas and You know even
Indica's but it's hard breeding turpentine
[SPEAKER_02]: out Yeah, I've often wondered why that is
like it is such a dominant gene,
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if it's just maybe it was like
one of the first Turpines to ever be
[SPEAKER_02]: expressed by cannabis and it's just so
deep seeded in the genome or something
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean back in back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've told me good luck breeding the
turpentine out of ABC and He worked with
[SPEAKER_00]: it for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's that's experience
right there Wow, that that's really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: to hear it taught you so much I wouldn't
have guessed but then when you said it out
[SPEAKER_02]: loud I was like, oh, I guess that that
makes sense actually Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean don't get me wrong though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like turpentine I'm just not the
hugest fan of smoking turpentine like I
[SPEAKER_00]: like the sniff The smoke just never hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know Well, I mean before I forget
what is your favorite sort of terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Limonene's pine enes, you know,
even like lemon lose all awesome means any
[SPEAKER_00]: any of those just I think though the the
Limonene and pine ene are Probably pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: close to my favorites Yeah, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess you must love like the
lemon lime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, geez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the the lemon tree turps even
skittles I mean, you know That's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: nother topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry I wanted to I wanted to ask
you so we've spoken about some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: regular projects you've been doing
recently Let's now talk about the femme I
[SPEAKER_02]: know that the community is absolutely
bursting at the seams to get their hands
[SPEAKER_02]: on these f1 Durban hybrids You've been
making right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us a little bit about this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did this project come about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean You know, I've always kind of
wanted to test theories And you know see
[SPEAKER_00]: if certain claims or you know what they
what they are I mean, you know most folks
[SPEAKER_00]: know that you know, Jigga, you know
claimed that you know what cherry pie was
[SPEAKER_00]: f1 derb times granddaddy purple and then
Girl Scouts was Flowrida OG times f1 derb
[SPEAKER_00]: now, you know, you got other folks like
Kenny Powers being like nah And then you
[SPEAKER_00]: got you know other cats like s flux
capacity Being like mmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no So, you know, you got a lot of
these folks in the cookie fam,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know who actually were more into the
breeding side of things or Accident side
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know I'm saying we don't think so,
but you know, it doesn't hurt to try out
[SPEAKER_00]: the f1 derb itself grows like Girl Scout
cookies but it doesn't smell like Girl
[SPEAKER_02]: Scout cookies So that's very interesting
what does it smell like out of curiosity
[SPEAKER_00]: Honest stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was hitting all the not so dog up
and being like the stem rub smells like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo purple hybrid and as flux capacitor
He he was alluding I think I don't quote
[SPEAKER_00]: me but he was alluding to you know that f1
derb being a Mendo purple hybrid of sorts
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't know but that stem rub
it was just like because anybody who
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled Mendo purple on the stem rub it is
one of the most pungent just who we plants
[SPEAKER_00]: you've ever smelled in your life and That
f1 derb has that same thing but then it it
[SPEAKER_00]: produces kind of a cookie ish kind of
nugget, you know a flower and Then that
[SPEAKER_00]: stem rub does Doesn't really translate so
much to the flower which you know it
[SPEAKER_02]: happens Yeah, wow, that's that's so so
interesting and I mean out of curiosity
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the f1 derb does it smoke just like a
regular derb?
[SPEAKER_02]: What what's it like on its own?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay I'm mostly familiar with the This cut
that goes around Colorado, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: California Yeah, as Durban poison and it's
just a super strong it tests it like 5% or
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.5% pure turpentine And so the f1 derb I
I don't smell any turpentine in it you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, so But then uh, you know,
there might be aspects of like black or
[SPEAKER_00]: licorice anise to it which You know most
people associate that with Durban poison,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the original old-school Durban
poison But Mendo purple like especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: the s ones There's all kinds of black
licorice and anise in that stuff So I
[SPEAKER_00]: associate it more with the Mendo purple
Whereas other people might associate with
[SPEAKER_00]: you know an old-school Durban poison Yes,
okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all very interesting Because it
all it definitely checks out in your head
[SPEAKER_02]: because the Mendo perp structure is also
Probably not too different to a cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: structure in a sense It's a it's a lanky
indica type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was gonna say you mentioned
earlier that there's long been these
[SPEAKER_02]: speculations From from powers up a jigger,
you know cherry pie has f1 derb in it and
[SPEAKER_02]: GDP Do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that's more likely or less
likely than the cookies claim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man I mean I I could go either way,
you know on that You know, maybe yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe no You know, I Don't want to over
speculate quite yet What it makes me think
[SPEAKER_02]: is if it was true He like jigger would
have had to have somehow been connected to
[SPEAKER_02]: like either their crew made GDP cherry pie
as cookie made it all and that's how you
[SPEAKER_02]: Know or he was somehow tied into all of
the crews that did it and they're all
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh, yeah We all use this same clone
like it does just even from a logistics
[SPEAKER_02]: point of view.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of a bit doubtful Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of it is just you know They
had this plant this plant and this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room these plants her you know and
You know, they got seeds out of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then when they grow them out It's usually
if you know your plants you can you can
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of tell you know, what might apply
Unpollinated what you know, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Etc I mean that that's what got me into
feminized breeding, you know 25 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a little herm in a room finding a
seed in your sensei crop and being like
[SPEAKER_00]: ooh growing that seed up that seed don't
herm grow something Fantastic like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of this little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like oh shoot You know these
feminized seeds can't be as bad as some
[SPEAKER_02]: people say they it's yeah, you know truly
truly So, I mean, I know you've done
[SPEAKER_02]: extensive work with the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you had any change of mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think Urkel might still be in
cookies or are you more now leaning to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo purposes you've alluded to I Mean if
there's GDP in there at any step,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's that's gonna be you know
Urkel right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I Still think it has to have it there
because there's the whole og cush breath
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and anytime you double up on a
cookie type genetic like if you cross
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies with fritters or cookies with
wedding cake or Wedding cake with fritters
[SPEAKER_00]: you get these og KB the og cush breath You
know Girl Scout cookie types and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: always a doubling up on the genetic it's
the recessive trait coming back through in
[SPEAKER_00]: any form of an f2 and So it's got to have
that that Urkel trait in there from from
[SPEAKER_00]: some way it's somewhere, you know,
I mean because I haven't seen that that
[SPEAKER_00]: that phenotype or genotype or whatever of
plant You know on anything but you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Urkel and Girl Scouts going forward You
know Yeah, definitely I tend to agree that
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I guess the question then is do you
think we'll ever truly find out the
[SPEAKER_02]: lineage or you think the best will get is
what you're doing Just making similar
[SPEAKER_02]: sorts of things and just seeing what the
seeds produce I mean if the hybrids are
[SPEAKER_00]: similar the same, I mean, uh, you know,
I think I think can find out but You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um Yeah, yeah, I don't know Yeah,
it's trying yeah, I mean well I was gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: ask have you found that like the most
popular line from the f1 hybrids you did
[SPEAKER_02]: with sorry the f1 Durban hybrids you did
is The flow rider f1 do like people
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to test it Yeah, I think that's
that's the one that Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah holds the most potential Yeah,
well la la and I'd have you have you
[SPEAKER_02]: popped any of those yourself so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just two early days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, no They're they're they're in the
ground now Should have known Cool cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean while we're on the top Of the
Urkel I wanted to ask, you know Have you
[SPEAKER_02]: got any Urkel projects in the future
because I know that like I mean Urkel work
[SPEAKER_02]: in general is pretty interesting to me
because I really like the plant I like the
[SPEAKER_02]: effects the the flavors the smells but
you've also Done a twist in that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: done like s2s and I think that work is
really quite novel among a lot of breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you plan to take it to s3s?
[SPEAKER_02]: What what's your thoughts on the s2s?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you at with the Urkel project
overall?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that that ties into You know the
whole ABC kind of recessive inbred blah
[SPEAKER_00]: blah blah So when when when you grow the
Urkel s1s out you get like 10% mutant
[SPEAKER_00]: which is that OG KB type of plant and then
you get like I don't know 40 or 50 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: crap And then then you get you know 20%
that you know are are pretty nice decent
[SPEAKER_00]: representation And then you get maybe 10%
that's just like oh we you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are high quality, you know Urkel
type plants now when I took and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: made Sister sister s2s where I took one
sister and pollinated another sister with
[SPEAKER_00]: it I grew a bunch of different ones of
those out and they were all phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like 90% Just excellent plants
you got rid of all that nastiness that was
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Urkel s1s Unfortunately,
they grow half as half as slow or half as
[SPEAKER_00]: fast They grow twice as slow as Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go And anybody who's grown Urkel
is like Urkel's slow as shit and these
[SPEAKER_02]: things grow even more Slower well rid of
snows pace at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but their their quality is through
the roof You know, and so it's just like
[SPEAKER_00]: as as a standalone There there you can't
give this to any, you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can't be grown commercially You know So
it's just like well the quality is super
[SPEAKER_00]: high, but the economics of it is super low
So it it would be great as an outcross To
[SPEAKER_00]: something but not as just a standalone
type of plant That's perfect because I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to ask, you know, you've you've
done a few remakes of lines You've done
[SPEAKER_02]: using the update like, you know The Urkel
s1 that you've selected over the original
[SPEAKER_02]: when you do these revised crosses Do you
find that you get significantly different
[SPEAKER_02]: results or it's just minorly different,
but maybe a little better in certain ways
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Like the 103 times Urkel I've done it
both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done Urkel times 103 and then 103
times Urkel Those plants don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like twice as big, you know a
twice as fast growing as the sister sister
[SPEAKER_00]: so You know, it's because it has all the
Urkel genetics and then you know You know
[SPEAKER_00]: the the s1 whereas the s1 s2 S1,
you know, it doesn't have all that wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those plants grew way better than you
know than the s1 s1 But their quality was
[SPEAKER_00]: way more variable as well You know,
they were higher cult quality than an s1
[SPEAKER_00]: just by itself and Urkel s1 But you know
They weren't as high a quality as just the
[SPEAKER_02]: sister sister s1 Wow, do you think that
that sort Of thing is what you're gonna do
[SPEAKER_02]: going forward like looking to hunt through
some s1s and then do those pair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah No, that's that's that's my favorite
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I make s1s, you know,
I mean, you know and eventually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what you know breed them into
s2s and then and then hybridize You know
[SPEAKER_00]: this s2 population with this s2
population, you know And though those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants those plants can really be
phenomenal if you make the right selection
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really exciting to hear I'm keen to
see where it goes You've touched on a
[SPEAKER_02]: deeper sort of point that I was hoping to
ask you which was that I was wondering
[SPEAKER_02]: have you made any Observations about the
way traits are passed on When you fem one
[SPEAKER_02]: plant versus the other like as you said
you reverse the 103 onto the original and
[SPEAKER_02]: you reverse the original into the 103 Do
you find that the act of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Reversing a plant and making it the pollen
donor changes the way it passes on genes
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's largely the same It seems like
it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the main one I have Example of that
is I grew up Let me make sure I got this
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow I think a hundred of Mendo purple
times Urkel and The Mendo purple itself in
[SPEAKER_00]: s1s is extremely variable, you know flower
wise smell wise I mean the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'll look almost the same but
once they flower it's all over the map Now
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Mendo purple times Urkel it was
like all kinds of different Mendo purple
[SPEAKER_00]: type variations But then I grew 20 24 25
out of the Urkel times Mendo purple and
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single plant was an Urkel type plant
You know So it's almost like you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they Depending on if they're used as a
male or female they push different things
[SPEAKER_00]: forward You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have a lot more experimentation to
go on all that But it definitely seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know, you you create different
things depending on which one you reverse
[SPEAKER_02]: You know and I remember in the past I
can't remember if it was subcool or
[SPEAKER_02]: someone used to say, you know,
whatever's the pollen donor is gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: impart like structure and potency Do you
think it's as clear cut as that or do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's like it's more variable and it
just it might vary I Think it's real
[SPEAKER_00]: variable, especially I think it really
depends on you know You know what your
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen donor is and how much you know
stuff is in that you know, I I Had phyllis
[SPEAKER_00]: run a bunch of stuff, you know over the
years, you know for better or worse and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of their data is Yeah, not factual But
my main thing for doing doing that Having
[SPEAKER_00]: things tested is I really want to know
what the you know What the stability is
[SPEAKER_00]: what the you know, I'm having a brain fart
on the words.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ain't a scientist You know Whenever you
get into an s1 s2 population, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: everything becomes more and more stable
and so It really depends on what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using as your mail How how it passes
forward I think you know On that topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it was one of the fan submitted
questions people were wondering,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, obviously the phyllis The way it
all played out and the fallout from it
[SPEAKER_02]: left a lot of people quite skeptical of
genomic companies and data collection
[SPEAKER_02]: companies the like Do you think there's
any companies that are currently around
[SPEAKER_02]: that you would trust with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you're just not really engaging in that
sort of thing at the moment I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: entertained it too much just because You
know Phyllis kind of left a sour taste in
[SPEAKER_00]: my mouth and I don't I don't know if any
of these other You know companies Can do
[SPEAKER_00]: what we want them to do or if it's just
gonna be more of the same phyllis type of
[SPEAKER_02]: blah blah blah You know, yeah,
I think that's pretty understandable
[SPEAKER_02]: approach a few questions ago You when you
were talking about the Urkels being really
[SPEAKER_02]: slow growing and like not not good
commercial picks at all I did want to ask
[SPEAKER_02]: you out of the seeds you offer What are
your top three?
[SPEAKER_02]: Recommendations for someone who maybe has
a facility or a bigger space they're
[SPEAKER_02]: working with and they're like I want to
run your stuff But you know, it does need
[SPEAKER_02]: to lend itself a little bit towards the
things that a commercial operation would
[SPEAKER_02]: need You know, maybe a little better
yielding and maybe some good turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are maybe some things you might
recommend for those folk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh usually anything in the like T 1000,
you know catalog those you know We're
[SPEAKER_00]: really good when you know, I ran them You
know, I like the chem D hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they make really high quality,
you know plants and big yielders You know
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that you know people can you know
get potency and yield because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's another thing too when you're doing
commercial you need you know yields and
[SPEAKER_00]: you need High tests because everybody's
obsessed with you know something that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: got to be 30 35 percent testing you know
none of the dispensaries, you know are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna pay money for Something that don't
test high Yeah, it's a sad truth,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you know, the real Hardcore
cannabis community the the sort of the
[SPEAKER_02]: space that we exist in so to speak like
generally speaking I just say anyone who's
[SPEAKER_02]: listening to this show you're probably
like in the top 0.1 percent of passionate
[SPEAKER_02]: about because like who else would sit here
and listen for hours about this stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like our community is starting to
accept very much that like, you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: chem 91 You know, maybe it tests like 18
19 percent, but it's good smoke You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you think we'd ever get there
commercially where we get more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: general education among the public?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think the numbers will still
dominate?
[SPEAKER_00]: They it needs to get to a point where the
numbers don't mean, you know anything
[SPEAKER_00]: because Realistically if you think about
it, the numbers are an equation you know
[SPEAKER_00]: every plant or most plants have like a
ceiling, right and You know if you take
[SPEAKER_00]: one puff, you know, two puff three puff,
you know, you keep going up Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: some plants might have a ceiling of two
two puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas another ten another a hundred,
you know, and so, you know something with
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 percent ten puffs deep you're like well
I shouldn't have taken those last three,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whereas you know something with
a ceiling of like, you know three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: puffs You can't get higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just like, you know that thirty
percent, you know Ain't really doing you
[SPEAKER_00]: much much favors when you can't get higher
than that three or four puffs So,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know Have you got any thoughts on what
it is that actually?
[SPEAKER_02]: Contributes to the ceiling effect I think
I really listened to the DJ short episode
[SPEAKER_02]: not long ago and he said oh I think that
maybe there's like a tiny bit of CBD in
[SPEAKER_02]: the background or something It just sort
of like limits how high you can get I'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: interested to hear Do you have any
thoughts on what might be that ceiling we
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't know if I think that deep
Yeah, yeah, I'm a pretty simple fella,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know if it sniffs good, you know Does
the trick, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay That works for me as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean on that topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you got any?
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants or crosses that you would recommend
to people if they are looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: something that has a higher ceiling
because I actually get a lot of messages
[SPEAKER_02]: from people who are Probably only used to
the more modern stuff and they're like I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't really get what people mean by this
ceiling thing Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I swear the the chems,
you know the whole chem family You know
[SPEAKER_00]: tends to do really well and like you
mentioned about that chem 91 You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it generally does only test around like 18
19 percent you know every time we have it
[SPEAKER_00]: tested and yet it will in hybrids it will
almost double a lot of You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you cross it with something weak,
it almost doubles the you know the numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: with whatever you cross it to So,
you know, I mean chem 91 is not even
[SPEAKER_00]: remotely my favorite as a standalone But
just what it can do, you know in hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything, you know, there's no argue
and it's it's an excellent plant I
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally, you know more so for breeding
Let's let's go down this path because I
[SPEAKER_02]: got a few questions about the chem I'd
love to ask you and and the first one is
[SPEAKER_02]: What is your personal favorite of the chem
91 hybrids you've done?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a few I've had a few I definitely
smoked all of all of this select plant of
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour diesel times chem 91 that thing was
amazing and then there was there was just
[SPEAKER_00]: a Regular old chem 91 times Girl Scouts
that I smoked all that one, too It's
[SPEAKER_00]: really good so I Don't I don't know how
many I've grown in in the last year or
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh No, no there I I grew a few but they
were like triple hybrids I think they were
[SPEAKER_00]: chem 91 times Girl Scouts crossed with you
know, like ruthless runs and You know some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these other things And you know those
all came out really nice as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: so That's interesting I was talking to not
so dog recently and He mentioned that you
[SPEAKER_02]: and him were talking about it and you'd
said, you know the chem It just really
[SPEAKER_02]: passes on potency quite consistently when
I heard that I started thinking Do you
[SPEAKER_02]: view it in that sense as essentially a
breeding tool more than like its own
[SPEAKER_02]: unique thing or how?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you use it in breeding projects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it's definitely a tool
to to increase potency and you know all
[SPEAKER_02]: that Yeah And and most recently you've
done the really interesting and novel chem
[SPEAKER_02]: 91 hybrids I think a lot of people super
interested in them For the chem one,
[SPEAKER_02]: how would you describe it to people?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's its effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what's it like as a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So chem one It it tests, you know on par
with you know, a lot of the other chems
[SPEAKER_00]: roughly usually around 20% but uh,
it it tested like 5% terpenes and The bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: of that is all myrcine It's like one of
the highest just you know pure myrcine
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that you know have in the catalog
it's like a oh, I don't know 11 or 12 week
[SPEAKER_00]: type of plant and She's pretty ugly,
you know by you know today's standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean everybody wants that
pretty pretty looking, you know flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she's an ugly girl and She kind of
tends to pass the ugly You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, I mean That's a tough one as
especially today everybody loves Girl
[SPEAKER_00]: Scout Cookie And all the poly hybrids,
you know with that they like them because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're pretty but you know half the time
And if you like smoking cardboard,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all right, too That is a common
profile we've seen a lot of hype strains
[SPEAKER_02]: the old cardboard I've been while we're
talking about the chem one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as time's gone by I've been able
to appreciate more that it because to me I
[SPEAKER_02]: always thought the chem one it was just
out in the Field on its own and then the
[SPEAKER_02]: more I look at photos of say the chem four
I'm like actually I can see a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: relation here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question is Do you think it's from the
same seed stock as the chem D and the chem
[SPEAKER_02]: 91 or do you think it just has to be
different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so, you know you you you might you
know get different information from
[SPEAKER_00]: different peoples you interviews But I
still stand strong on the fact that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think The chem 91 it was the only you know
seed that was really kept From I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: there was the original chem sister from 91
and I think she was kept for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: too But for the most part it was the 91
that was kept and I think the D is a
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid with the 91 and then I think the 1
through 4 are all the same hybrid or not
[SPEAKER_00]: the same hybrid as the chem D but all you
know a hybrid of 91 because you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got those those I got clones of those
from Joe brand seed plants, you know of
[SPEAKER_00]: the 1 through 4 and They they were almost
identical sisters, you know But then their
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers, you know segregate out and they
they look a lot, you know different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know to each other the number three
was like the 91 but bigger chunkier better
[SPEAKER_00]: better plant but it was like You know a
match on the the you know, the the look
[SPEAKER_00]: and the smell and all that The four was
like amazing compared to all of them
[SPEAKER_00]: except for the fact that you know It was
it was kind of terrible, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: three or four weeks after you harvested it
because it just went brown Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard that a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'd be curious to ask,
you know I'm sure we're gonna do a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: questions about this but like the chem one
and the chem four Visually at least have
[SPEAKER_02]: always struck me as looking like there's
like an nl5 haze in the mix What do you
[SPEAKER_02]: suspect the pollen donor onto the chem 91
might have been to make those?
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think somewhere in that realm,
you know, it definitely something
[SPEAKER_00]: something sensei and you know the The the
question I've always had is you know It
[SPEAKER_00]: for for for Greg, you know chem dog Greg
Is a What was he growing in the rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know he only had chem 91 it for
maybe four or five years at best before he
[SPEAKER_00]: lost it, right and so What was in his
rooms, you know during those years where
[SPEAKER_00]: something might have hermed and You know,
that's where he would have gotten those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He swears they came from that same
original seed But it's Highly unlikely You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I don't I don't believe you know,
but You know that better question is what
[SPEAKER_00]: was in his rooms at those times and he's
posted what you know over the years what
[SPEAKER_00]: was but You know, I think some of the
posts from like Planet Gonja and I see mag
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't aren't there anymore You know
Planet Gonja is gone and I see mag,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he deleted his account I'm sure
and so a lot of his posts that weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, you know copied and you
know Blah blah are gone, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's hard for most people to find out
who said what you know, cuz it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna say guest, you know and You know
somebody like me who was there is like I
[SPEAKER_02]: know who that guest was Okay, so I mean
the follow-up you sort of alluded to it
[SPEAKER_02]: but I just wanted to nail down on it,
you know, there's a lot of focal
[SPEAKER_02]: discussion recently when Matt put up a
post saying that you know He suspects the
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem D is the 91 by super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the lineage you think is what's
behind the D?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be it could be or I mean I've
always almost thought You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be like maybe a Shiva skunk
Because I swear I swear I swear Greg was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing some Shiva skunk back then But you
know It could have been any of those
[SPEAKER_00]: types, you know Yeah, other Shiva almost
see it feels right You know Yeah now that
[SPEAKER_02]: you say I do get what you mean a bit of
that skunk influence in there as well like
[SPEAKER_02]: the not the Virginia super skunk,
but just the sense he skunk Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, no that that certainly makes
sense and then so look we as I Did when I
[SPEAKER_02]: was chatting to not so we've spoken about
the one in the for the day The question
[SPEAKER_02]: has to be asked any ideas on the 90 ones
lineage then I mean for one I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: just by you know breeding with it s ones
predominantly because you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown out the better part of a couple
hundred, you know s ones with me and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the homies and It's so stable I
swear, you know the s ones I've made I
[SPEAKER_00]: Think the chem 91 itself is an s1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, technically I think you
know what I made are probably s twos,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and then I Think whatever plant
the chem 91 came from Yeah, there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a little bit of debate on it but
uh, I don't think some people are too
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong with the whole tie-in with hash
plant Yeah, well that was what I was gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: ask.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you feel skelly fits in the
picture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cuz I I really believe that the smell and
the effect are very similar, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will happily acknowledge that the
structures are so different I'm happy to
[SPEAKER_02]: entertain the debate that maybe they're
not related But it is it is a very uncanny
[SPEAKER_02]: resemblance in smell and effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always thought So, you know,
I have I have skelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have HP 13 They both have a similar
look between each other, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not not anywhere close to you know,
like identical but you know, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of similarities between those two and Then
those two kind of got me thinking well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew hash plant one back in the day from
the devil's harvest crew and That plant
[SPEAKER_00]: has some very strong similarities to not
only The HP 13 and the and the skelly but
[SPEAKER_00]: it almost looks more like the chem 91 You
know because it has those dark dark
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a similar leaf shape and It
actually grows like a bigger chem 91
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors Then you know chem 91 itself So,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know there there could be
something too The whole hash plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know theories Yeah, totally and I mean
you touched on the hash plant 13 I think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's one where people hear about it,
but it's hard to get a lot of info about
[SPEAKER_02]: it What's your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it is it because I mean I've only seen
the plant in veg one time at Bob
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemphill's house And I was like,
oh, this is a very thin leaf plant and he
[SPEAKER_02]: was like, yeah What's your take on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a hash plant hybrid,
you know Definitely retains a lot of you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, the hash plant to it, which you know
Anytime you have an indica sativa hybrid a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of times those Indica's can be
dominant in the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems you know I've got a ton of
experience going right now where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to go both ways, you know Indica
sativa and then sativa times indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I just want to see how all those pan out
with the you know using the different
[SPEAKER_00]: different ones for male and female but the
HP 13, you know it Yeah, yeah I Don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even speculate on that one Well,
I mean I was gonna say, you know I think
[SPEAKER_02]: JJ has put up some posts talking about how
he thinks there's like some Burmese and
[SPEAKER_02]: some stuff in there Given your experience
with the Burmese have any thoughts on that
[SPEAKER_02]: speculation because just based off what
I'm hearing it sounds like the Burmese is
[SPEAKER_00]: like maybe Way too long flowering Right
But you know, they're the right Indica,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it'll it'll shorten that flower
time down pretty good and I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: the HP 13 is a really quick flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, maybe a 10-weeker Yeah,
so yeah You know, yeah, I don't know I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know Some of those turf profiles do
kind of match up, you know with that that
[SPEAKER_00]: sweetness Of the Burmese it's definitely
not doesn't remind me of like the Indica
[SPEAKER_02]: type of turps Yeah Interesting
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and then a nice little segue into
the NL work you did was for the longest
[SPEAKER_02]: time people have Speculated that like sort
of the backbone of chem dog may have some
[SPEAKER_02]: NL in it now that you've done your NL work
Do you see that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um If if there is any NL in it I don't
think it's gonna be the five and the only
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when I've I've run out was is
the five There were some similarities on
[SPEAKER_00]: You know at least one plant Specifically
when I first ran them out to the old
[SPEAKER_00]: northern lights I got from my dad back in
94 But overall it it was more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: Different type of you know northern light
that you see in a lot of hybrids You know
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you know, I had the NL five,
you know back in the day We just had it as
[SPEAKER_00]: northern lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know, I'm not entirely sure you
know what we had one two ten.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know And then like what's your
takeaway been from the project you've done
[SPEAKER_02]: with Matt and you know The seeds from Greg
McAllister have you had any cool insights
[SPEAKER_02]: into that all and tell us a little bit
about what the NL seed line Is like in
[SPEAKER_02]: general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean it's like a you know,
the NL five of course is you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially supposed to be a pure indica
crossed with a Hawaiian sativa So it's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely hash plant esque, you know You
know super frosty, you know Some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants lean towards that You know that
Hawaiian type You know But you know most
[SPEAKER_00]: of them most of them were just kind of
like that That Amsterdam thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that was wild and crazy all the
way through the early mid 90s Yeah And uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, definitely a throwback.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure, you know to those That
era and do you think it stands up to what
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of people remember?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think there is an element of
like rose-shade glasses?
[SPEAKER_00]: I Mean as as much as I'm you know,
I love preservation You know, I mean you
[SPEAKER_00]: you take all the you know, the land races
land races are not you know, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not great for a whole lot of
things, you know, you can't grow
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial, you know Oftentimes they're
they don't they're not great for
[SPEAKER_00]: standalone plants like you know
headstache, you know, they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: building blocks and It kind of feels like
the NLs, you know might be great for
[SPEAKER_00]: building blocks, but they they really
don't stand up to you know, the the
[SPEAKER_02]: designer weed of today Yeah, certainly I
can understand that I mean as a follow-on
[SPEAKER_02]: having had that experience with the NL
five Is there a part of you that would be
[SPEAKER_02]: keen to grow out the purest indica if you
had like good sauce?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean Matt Matt right he's he's got
some of those seeds and hey, oh he tried
[SPEAKER_00]: to give him to me a few months back and I
think I got too lit and forgot him I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: shoot him a message and bump him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not on him at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot All I have to do is say yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well gets to crack and I don't know
uh, you know The the the pierce is a is an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it could be you know Probably closer
to the the northern lights that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew back in the the mid 90s But uh,
I mean I'd like to grow it I got so many
[SPEAKER_00]: things though on the plate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like damn it I'm not trying to
overload you So I mean look if you had to
[SPEAKER_02]: guess what do you think the NL you were
growing back in the 90s?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was do you think it was maybe more like a
one or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my guess that's always been you
know, kind of my hunch Yeah, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: never From everything I've seen of the
five it definitely, you know didn't seem
[SPEAKER_00]: like that was that was the hybrid but uh
Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you know to tie it on up You
you also did the work with the Hawaiian
[SPEAKER_02]: lights, which was really cool You know,
how did that differ to the NL five and and
[SPEAKER_02]: what sort of the general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Description you give for that one They
were extremely similar to the NL five,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was just a ton of that Super,
you know sweet pineappley just fruity,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just hawaiian turps on a lot of
those ones you know, um there was like
[SPEAKER_00]: hints of that stuff in the uh In in the NL
five, but it was it was almost prominent
[SPEAKER_00]: and dominant on on a lot of the ones in
the hawaiians Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, and I know that you had selected
keepers of the NL and the hawaiian You
[SPEAKER_02]: plan to breed with them going forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Well, you know The mother room got a
little full again and uh, I had to make
[SPEAKER_00]: some harsh decisions so I I have I think I
have two two keepers held of the NL five
[SPEAKER_00]: and then Everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um Maybe I I might have kept one hawaiian
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: My my mother room is ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sometimes I don't even know what's in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I dare ask how many plants do you have
in your mother room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, let's not talk about that on tv
Too hot for tv.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it Okay, well look we did have a
fan submitted question and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: wondering uh, they sort of reading into
what Where we were going with this
[SPEAKER_02]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were saying, you know, I can only
imagine that maintaining a mother room The
[SPEAKER_02]: size you have is almost a full-time job in
itself Do you have any tips or tricks for
[SPEAKER_02]: maintaining a big library and as a further
follow-up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any ipm tips because I can
only imagine that's something you're
[SPEAKER_00]: having to keep on top of right,
right, um, I mean I'll admit right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I I uh, um Try to do as minimal as I
can just to keep everything alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to grow things I undervert things a
lot and not so can vouch for this I
[SPEAKER_00]: undervert things a lot just to slow them
down so they don't grow fast I I give a
[SPEAKER_00]: very very limited nitrogen You know
because otherwise, you know, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: always up in the lights if I don't you
know Slow them down as for ipm,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh My favorites are pyganic spinosad and
uh liquid sulfur You know that tends to
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, keep most of the bugs You know
that could potentially come through,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know down and out we always have uh,
the thrips flying in through the Through
[SPEAKER_00]: the open doors and you know that kind of
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always powdery mildew growing on
everything outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Yeah, I can only imagine up your neck
of the woods because I think like a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people Who have never been to mendocino or
you know, northern california in general
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably can't appreciate how what the
climate is like there because it's only
[SPEAKER_02]: recently I really like you like it is
really Foggy in the mornings and most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day like it's hard to appreciate Yeah,
and i'm i'm pretty much entire most most
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely coastal based with all all my
stuff Uh, I I still grow my you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: six california, you know personal legal
plants Uh, you know out out out in my
[SPEAKER_00]: place in the hills, but you know,
that's a totally different environment out
[SPEAKER_00]: there You know, it's 100 115 degrees,
you know all summer long out there and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, uh total total opposite of the coast
Wow, I mean on that point what sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: plants would you run for yourself both
from like things that you like but also
[SPEAKER_02]: that would do well in those conditions
because it sounds pretty hot yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I mean Uh one of my old school
favorites out there, um that always really
[SPEAKER_00]: did well was old betsy, you know,
and That's something that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of people are just like what?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know people around this general
area are like yeah old betsy's what's up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so She was always a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um my uh My uh bomb threat bubba,
um my bubba s1 selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: She she actually does really well out
there, you know, um For for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: reason i've got one of her grown this year
and uh, irene irene tended to do pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: okay Um when I grew her so i've got an
irene, uh this year um chem d did good and
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, um You know, she's a late one,
but you know Really good quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I broke down and put a chem d out this
year just for just for fun so And a few a
[SPEAKER_02]: few others i'm just trying out this year
That's a beautiful mixture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would Be feeling very pleasure to smoke
any of those strains So I guess the
[SPEAKER_02]: question is are we going to see you do
hybrids with some of those ones like a
[SPEAKER_02]: project maybe with like because I know
you've pollinated old betsy and Some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the other ones you mentioned would you
ever and the irene?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you consider doing a project like
reversing irene or reversing betsy?
[SPEAKER_00]: so, uh I reversed irene and um,
I think I had a half half a bed half a
[SPEAKER_00]: light of irene to pollinate and I got 20
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no Yeah, uh irene was um, like what I
call a one percenter like she Like I got
[SPEAKER_00]: so few seeds on my irene like a four light
irene reversal That I grew a bunch of them
[SPEAKER_00]: out immediately just to make sure it
wasn't like pollen contamination or like
[SPEAKER_00]: something else firm to The room and they
were all irene plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but the the yeah, it was the pollen
was not very viable, um, and there wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: much of it to begin with um, and then
betsy, uh, she produced zero pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I reversed her and nothing so Yeah,
i'm a little sketched to do betsy again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know Um, but yeah, yeah,
yeah That's beautiful segue for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my favorite saying beautiful segue
because we had a question about like
[SPEAKER_02]: failed reversals like one of the listeners
is currently trying to reverse a chem dog
[SPEAKER_02]: d s1 they got from you they found like a
nice one they really like and they're like
[SPEAKER_02]: for the life of me like I He's i've seen
the photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's reversed it two or three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll get the nanas, but there's no plot
Pollen in them ever you got any tips or
[SPEAKER_02]: tricks for stubborn reversals?
[SPEAKER_00]: I I kind of wish I did but It's it's tough
and you know, uh It gets tougher in each
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um Like you know s1s, uh, you're gonna
have less plants that will actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, give you viable pollen um When
you hit s2s, it's even fewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, i've heard sam the skunk man say that
once you hit s4 s5 It's terminal you you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't you don't go past s5 You know,
but just seeing how plants do you know
[SPEAKER_00]: from the s1 to the s2, you know i'm like,
I don't know if I don't even want to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with the s4 or five plant a little shrubby
little mutants Wow, but I I honestly I I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any tips for that because uh
The the few times i've made a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: selections, um with s1s and I i've gone
through and i've sprayed all of these uh
[SPEAKER_00]: Different s1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, i'll have some that produce
lots of pollen Some that produce a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of pollen and then a lot that produced
no pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So You know It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had another question that was it was
very similar just talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, do you change dilution?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you apply the spray more frequently if
it if i'm interpreting this correctly It
[SPEAKER_02]: sounds like you've just got to reverse a
lot of plants and maybe one of them will
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh Yeah, it can be like that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um That's the thing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, um, i've experimented a lot with you
know, different dilutions Uh multiple,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know frequency, you know springs,
uh, you know, this that other um and So
[SPEAKER_00]: i've mentioned this before um,
generally when I just reverse,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a plant i'll i'll take uh,
like eight plants is my usual and You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, they'll be in like five gallon pots
and they'll be you know, nice two to three
[SPEAKER_00]: foot, you know plants, you know around and
tall and uh Oftentimes with uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these, you know, even moderate,
you know reversal plants I'll only get out
[SPEAKER_00]: of eight I'll only get like two that
produce decent pollen and then i'll have a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple put on You know midsy pollen And
then i'll have a bunch of them put on no
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have somebody reversing just one
plant or two plants Yeah, I mean that You
[SPEAKER_00]: know You're gonna have you can imagine,
you know, there's there's gonna be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, three four five fails And then
you might get one to kind of hit and then
[SPEAKER_00]: another time you'll get one to really hit
you know And that's off just the same
[SPEAKER_00]: exact plant same dilution same spraying,
you know, so I mean i've i've definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: done this a lot, but I You know,
I I still can't you know tell you oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what works, you know, because it's
so variable and what I mean my question is
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can you spray eight plants with the
same exact dilution same time same
[SPEAKER_00]: everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah You know two are great pollen two
are midsy and four don't even give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm I'm like, uh, I got questions,
too Yeah, I have to acknowledge the first
[SPEAKER_02]: time I ever did a reversal I think I got
one of the midsy ones and and I thought
[SPEAKER_02]: that was like the baseline and I'll
acknowledge I've been caught out the next
[SPEAKER_02]: time I did it I got no pollen and I was
like what the fuck is going on
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so variable, uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like uh, it's like the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up to the stars So I wanted to ask
you, you know, you have been doing these
[SPEAKER_02]: wicked grows in these planters I think
everyone should go look at your instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do like, you know, these really cool
fino hunts in the beds Really gorgeous
[SPEAKER_02]: looking plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give us a quick Rundown of your
style when you're doing that because I got
[SPEAKER_02]: to give you a shout out I remember first
time I came to the emerald cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came and saw you at the booth and You
you were mentioning that the girl scout
[SPEAKER_02]: reversal you were trying to do it didn't
work so you ended up with all this sensi
[SPEAKER_02]: crop and The cookies and the patient zero
bud you gave me it was so memorable and
[SPEAKER_02]: you were like, yeah I grew it in like the
planters and um, oh my god, so superior
[SPEAKER_02]: really memorable stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the rundown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just use like a Coco peat blend,
you know Around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called black gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, I'm there's tons of
different types and then I just put in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of a bunch of amendments I think my
base is mostly fish frass insect frass and
[SPEAKER_00]: You know trace minerals and Yeah,
I've got like 20 different organic
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of I try to give the plants a
buffet of quick release medium release and
[SPEAKER_00]: slow release stuff and Then I try to just
give them plain water for the duration
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're in in those beds Just super
simple, you know Yeah, beautiful stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to ask you normally we start with
this one, but we've been a bit sidetracked
[SPEAKER_02]: Having fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you been smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still been smoking on a ton of like
the The family feud family feud times Or
[SPEAKER_00]: wait, yeah family few times like ruthless
runs family feud times The punch one was
[SPEAKER_00]: okay The triangle Kush Urkel 103 s ones
those were really nice Bunch of z s ones a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of sherbert s ones basically,
I Did a fetal hunt a handful of months
[SPEAKER_00]: back and so I've had like 500 plants
hanging We go up and like just you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pull pull, you know three or four You know
samples every night or two and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke through, you know the different ones
But uh, yeah pretty much a you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just been smoking on that last 500 seed
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, just a bunch of bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tough job, but someone's got to do
it That's right That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean a lot of questions to jump into
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the first one is Do you feel like
when you're testing that many phenotypes?
[SPEAKER_02]: It it can almost become a bit more
difficult to discern the clear winners
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm sure at the end of a 500 seed
phenohunt You've got like 10 plants of the
[SPEAKER_02]: same variety and they're all really good
Like how do you how do you whittle them
[SPEAKER_02]: down or do you just end up with a few
keepers?
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts like that like it starts,
you know Initially like it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult it seems and it probably you
know is the whole time but eventually you
[SPEAKER_00]: start, you know, finding ones that really
stand out, right and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you go back to those and you go back to
those and Then you get sad when there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: more of that plant left.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a a skittles 85 s1 and That one
stood out and we kept trying to smoke all
[SPEAKER_00]: these other skittles s1s and it's just
like and then we just cheeped through the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole z85 plant And now we have no more
z85.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even want to smoke the others You
know you become spoiled Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I actually am trying I've got a
reversal going with that z85 right now and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not crossing my fingers too too too
much because z is a hard one You know to
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's what is the 85 phenotype like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it has like all the turps of z and
it's potent Wow Because z itself ain't the
[SPEAKER_00]: strongest smoke in the shop When it when
uh when I Had Had the ABCs tested They
[SPEAKER_00]: came in pretty low and z came in two
percent higher So that bastard canvas is
[SPEAKER_02]: almost as strong as z Wow, I never would
never would have thought that there you go
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know So so when you've done this
massive skittles phenohunt What sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: insights have you gotten from that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you got any more ideas about what
might be the lineage of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh I I think well for one, I think it's
probably an S1 z is an s1 to start with
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I'm pretty sure it's just some
some type of like a Girl Scout cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid Girl Scout cookie og type,
you know Something along those lines It
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't even have to be an og type It
could just be a Girl Scout cookie hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: type and the og is you know, you know from
the Girl Scouts So yeah Wow, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and then you know, you you sort of
touched on it loosely you did the sherb s1
[SPEAKER_02]: project Did that help solidify any
thoughts about the possible relationship?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean there was definitely some z types
in there for sure Or z leaners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put it this way, but um,
I only ran 70 of them out I think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 only Yeah, that's like more than anyone
does But I I didn't Find a plant that was
[SPEAKER_00]: like that right there is z, you know So,
um, I did find one plant that was freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing and it was the best smelling plant
out of 500 plants a hurricane off of that
[SPEAKER_00]: seed run and On the sherbert s1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just absolutely amazing and it was
just one of those sherb s1s, but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing and of course, you know,
I went to the clone room and yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the one that was dead Oh
heartbreaking Yeah, so I kind of want to
[SPEAKER_00]: dip into the sherb s1s again and run out
at least a hundred or maybe even 200 See
[SPEAKER_00]: if I can't find z and that one so
Interesting interesting and I mean from
[SPEAKER_02]: like a sort of a commercial point of view
What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be able to dethrone the skittles
turps because it feels like for something
[SPEAKER_02]: to be really popular these days It's got
to be like gassy skittles purple That's
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of the general combo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think anything's gonna help us
break free of that mold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe maybe a new flavor, but just as just
as pungent Yeah, yeah, so just some yeah I
[SPEAKER_02]: guess it's almost ushered in this wave of
like it has to be insanely loud or it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just it just can't stand up Yeah,
yeah, cuz there's there's tons of just
[SPEAKER_00]: average out there, you know, it just Has
to be something just really really pungent
[SPEAKER_02]: and strong Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean in that same lane of thought
Indicas are just absolutely dominating the
[SPEAKER_02]: market and I know that there's a small but
growing movement of people who are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know We really need to show the
general public that sativas have a lot to
[SPEAKER_02]: offer and it doesn't need to be like a
pure tie But you know super silver haze
[SPEAKER_02]: did really well for a reason right like it
was sort of that middle ground Do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Will ever get more traction with sativas
and the general public or do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica is just too prevalent and when most
people think of weed they think of like
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting a bit zoned out in your chair at
the end of the day as opposed to like an
[SPEAKER_02]: uplifting energetic thing Right,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean It should it should become more
prevalent You'd think more people would
[SPEAKER_00]: would be entertaining it, you know during
the day and stuff I don't know It it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just uh, I don't know Even the sativas
that are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just kind of so hybridized out You
know, I don't even know if you're you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really getting that sativa sativa
experience from you know A lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa offerings, you know That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you ever want to focus on doing like
a sativa line or it's just not really your
[SPEAKER_00]: passion Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I definitely would they're just I mean
Indica's are way easier than they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's I'm sure Yeah, the time constraints
makes it hard doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm definitely trying to cross kind
of going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You asked about Tom's Hayes and I'm
entertaining some you know, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of how they built Hayes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know Hybridizing, you know different
sativas all together you know so I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know cross the Burmese with you know a
Colombian with a you know, a Mexican with
[SPEAKER_00]: a you know, so on and so on I mean if you
start making you know good selections of
[SPEAKER_00]: each one and then you know, you know
combining them and Then you know I can
[SPEAKER_00]: even you know combine those you using
feminized techniques which You would
[SPEAKER_00]: really speed things along and you know
kind of you know Get to a finished product
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot sooner than if you're just doing rag
braiding once a year type of thing Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we got a good fan submitted question which
was they were saying are there any Mexican
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties that Stand out to you that you
would consider to be some of the better
[SPEAKER_02]: ones because I think there is a growing
movement of people who are realizing that
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombians Mexicans, maybe some of these
were the real Unsung heroes of like the
[SPEAKER_02]: land race sativas because you just mostly
hear about Thai and Southeast Asia,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Colombians got a big following Yeah,
I mean Any of the older ones, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't I personally wouldn't trust
anything, you know That's that's come up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the last 20 20 plus years But you know
the older walk ins Mitchell cons,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know all that kind of stuff Anybody
who's preserved You know lines that came
[SPEAKER_00]: came out because anything that's really
I'm I'm talking maybe 25 30 years Anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's come from Mexico since then has a
good good chance of being you know
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated with you know Modern
Amsterdam genetics, whatever whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I mean and that's the same to be
said anywhere where land races come from I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, I don't think you could go to
Afghanistan or Pakistan or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: without Running across a bunch of DNA
genetic contamination Of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the pun as well DNA genetic
contaminate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good Shout out Ari and it wasn't a
purposeful pun Yeah I mean, you know While
[SPEAKER_02]: we're on the topic, I would love to ask,
you know, how do you go about sourcing
[SPEAKER_02]: this material?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if someone messages you and says hey,
I got this killer old stuff like do you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to Sort of approach that with an
element of suspicion or do you have like a
[SPEAKER_02]: set way you go about vouching stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your process?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean most of the stuff I've you know,
worked with is you know, all either older
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff or you know, you can kind of You can
kind of vet where it came from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, follow the trail back You know
if somebody's like I just got from my
[SPEAKER_00]: cousin, you know last year, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: In the land race community, you know a lot
of them a lot of folks in it, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to you know Trace trace things back,
you know pretty well so and then bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line is you know, I always grow,
you know grow these things out beforehand
[SPEAKER_00]: and If I like them all year I'll probably
use them but if it's there there's been
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty like I grew out a purple Yarkin
line Years ago and it was absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible and tons of people are talking it
up, but man I didn't even make one seed of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you So, you know Wow, I mean just to
quickly, you know wrap up that school of
[SPEAKER_02]: thought with the land races do you think
we're quickly slash have already got to a
[SPEAKER_02]: point where Land races essentially will
only exist in people's seed catalogs and
[SPEAKER_02]: like they're not really indigenous to
places anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, I mean There there might be
little tiny pockets here and there but I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean Land races generally stem from areas
where a Decent amount of people were you
[SPEAKER_00]: know growing, you know For some kind of
commercial, you know, right Reasons and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's you know why they have seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you know seeds became available
one way or another so but now you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's either not that happening or You
know, I don't see a whole lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Keeping things going,
you know Outside of little tiny niche
[SPEAKER_02]: pockets, you know Yeah, look it makes
sense and it's certainly a bit concerning
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to sort of hope that in the next 20
So years like people realize what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on and especially when you see Thailand
opening the floodgates to cookies It's
[SPEAKER_00]: like I don't think they're gonna be
growing Thailand races Well, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, okay well while we're on the topic
of old school stuff that's been preserved
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you've got the Kush for cutting
which is one that you really don't hear
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned very much What can you tell us
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could say I had That one fell
through the crack it was it was a cool
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it was a cool plant I don't know if
I can't remember how if I'm supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about that or not I I got that
through Bodhi Maybe maybe I'll hit Bodhi
[SPEAKER_00]: up and be like, can I talk about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can censor it but uh, I got that
through Bodhi and he got it directly from
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim Ortega right and One of the stories
was the Hindu Kush You know that was
[SPEAKER_00]: available back in the day was Kush for
crossed with northern lights to right
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was the cushiest of the northern
lights So, I mean You know, it's a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: plant You know has a nice incense each
herb It smells very Baba esque on a
[SPEAKER_00]: different structured style of a plant But
you know Past past, you know it coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from Jim Ortega I don't know a whole lot
about it Yeah, that look that's that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: story I'd heard from Bodhi that it was
like one of the parents since he used and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's meant to be really good So that that
all kind of checks out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you did some hybrids with it with
like the T 1000 Have you had a chance to
[SPEAKER_02]: see how any of those have turned out or
you just got your plate full already?
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran a couple of the Kush for hybrids out
definitely the T 1000s and They were good
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't as terpies, you know,
I mean just like we've talked,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's one two three different
things that everybody wants and You know
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else, you know, people are like
and and so it kind of falls into that
[SPEAKER_00]: category It made some beautiful flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smelled good blah blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they weren't that over-the-top
terpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know kind of to the wayside Yeah,
that that is interesting how you talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about it, you know Like there's things we
want there's things other people want if
[SPEAKER_02]: you if you were just left to your own
Devices and could pursue just purely
[SPEAKER_02]: passion projects, you know You you win the
lotto and so now you're just breeding for
[SPEAKER_02]: just shits and giggles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what you want to do What sort of
stuff would you be focusing on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should start thinking about that
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I always Um, I think I'm kind of
already doing that But uh, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Love the answer man that you live in the
dream already you're pursuing the passion
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good answer right because I tell
people a lot of people have this sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: Dire straight to view of the modern
breeding landscape and they say,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know How am I meant to establish
myself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's the same and I sort of allude
to what you just said.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like pursue what you're interested In
if you're interested in it people will
[SPEAKER_02]: probably be interested in it Right,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean Honestly, you know stuff that was
just purely Passion was you know playing
[SPEAKER_00]: around with the ABCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean Surprisingly enough there wasn't
barely a single dollar in the ABCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yes, I I had a lot of fun with those
and I'd like to revisit them too,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know But yeah, it definitely has to be
just all passion I like those weirdo
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and I'd love to be able to Make one
of those weirdos actually, you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: decent quality as well Yeah Definitely
that that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we'll have to touch base next time
