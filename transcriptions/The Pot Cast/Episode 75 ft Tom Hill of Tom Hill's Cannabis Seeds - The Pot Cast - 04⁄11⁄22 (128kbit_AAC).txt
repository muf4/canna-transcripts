[SPEAKER_04]: All righty gang, we're back for another
one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for joining us.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on this episode, we have a much
anticipated guest, possibly one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: most requested.
[SPEAKER_04]: A huge thank you to the land race legend,
master of both the hash plants and the
[SPEAKER_04]: Hayes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom Hill, thank you for joining us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavy days.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you sir?
[SPEAKER_04]: I am very good, my friend.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very grateful to be chatting to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me, what are you smoking on today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something a neighbor brought by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what the hell it is,
but it's really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to have to ask him,
you know, he's one of these guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: knows what he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we, when, you know, neighbors are
always bringing over their best buds to
[SPEAKER_00]: show off around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when this guy comes over, you know,
it's going to be really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that you live in like NorCal where,
you know, there's a lot of serious
[SPEAKER_04]: growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do the growers out there, do they grow a
variety of different strains or do they
[SPEAKER_04]: tend to stick to like the tried and tested
things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I think the majority of
anybody that's doing any growing these
[SPEAKER_00]: days is, is unfortunately, you know,
trying to, trying to grow for the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the buyers and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's getting a bit old.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can imagine, especially given,
you know, your history of lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it Sativa dominant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Indica dominant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me an idea about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's probably some hybrid of unknown,
you know, it's probably unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's certainly Sativa leaning in its
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a very, very heavy cerebral
high.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, out of curiosity, have you
tried any varieties in the recent past
[SPEAKER_04]: that are like newer creations that have
impressed you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure, you know, shit, I don't,
you know, some of this Gelato 33 that I
[SPEAKER_00]: just smoked, it doesn't taste very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not super loud or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it doesn't taste bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, it's not,
it's not super flavorful, but it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: really, has a really good, heavy,
you know, cerebral high that I liked a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OGs, you know, I love the Triangle
Kush and, and you know, that can be some
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty impressive herb as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so glad to hear you mentioned the TK,
because that is also definitely one of my
[SPEAKER_04]: favorites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever wanted to work with some of
those more modern lines, not just to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: them, but maybe toy around making some
seeds with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I grew out the TK.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know those guys, some of them
personally, it's the kind of circle that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been holding it up there in NorCal for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, maybe 10 years ago or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to flip it and failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had them in a greenhouse and it was just
too humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was busy with other stuff and I
didn't, I didn't really, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably try as hard as I should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I couldn't get any pollen off of
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you wanted to reverse it onto some
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think it might pair well with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, damn near anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my friend up there at TSI has it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it seems to be an excellent
parent, excellent general combining
[SPEAKER_00]: ability across a broad range of other
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think TK is definitely up there with
some of the best breeding plants I've ever
[SPEAKER_04]: heard of or come across.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think a hybrid with Hayes
would look like with the TK?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if it's been done,
but it would be cool in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that would be worth a look for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'd cross Hayes with anything
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that scene at the same time,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a, what a great answer there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go down that rabbit hole a bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people are very keen on your
Hayes and your Hayes experiences.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you just to start off, we've,
we've had a number of guests over the past
[SPEAKER_04]: few episodes talk about Hayes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the common things they talk
about is that there's so many different
[SPEAKER_04]: Hayes' out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what to you is Hayes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for, well, you know, I mean,
I know, I know a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one, the old one that I grew up
from Pogetronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's Hayes to me for sure,
but it's very different from like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights Hayes and stuff that's,
you know, and that stuff can be,
[SPEAKER_00]: can be just killer and rip your head off
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of Neville's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're both Hayes to me and I like
them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I just, I work with the one
that, that I prefer the most.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and in terms of like the effect,
is it like that really stimulating
[SPEAKER_04]: cerebral?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it like paranoia?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what sort of effect do you like the
most out of Hayes?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and to where you have to laugh
at yourself, you know, cause you're
[SPEAKER_00]: tripping, you know, peeking out the window
and stepping here and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just kind of, it's a shockingly
incredibly potent and cerebral high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I enjoy that, you know,
I mean, that, that, that stuff's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: disappear before I even touch anything
else when I come across a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the first job to go empty.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a, that's a sign of true quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take that over a lab any day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, it's probably a hard question
to ask, but what, what is your favourite
[SPEAKER_04]: Hayes Harvard you've done thus far?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some really good, when paired
with the deep chunk, the F2s are worth
[SPEAKER_00]: looking through.
[SPEAKER_00]: My neighbour gave me, another guy gave me
some of that a couple of weeks back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was incredibly good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the, the monkey Hayes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DC Hayes crosses that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we did him in, or we started
anyway in Spain back in 09, I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, that infamous Spain run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell us about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I think a lot of people,
including myself, saw the forum post and
[SPEAKER_04]: really captivated by the documentation you
did.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did that all go down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you, you know, Rocco, my friend Rocco
there in Spain, always been a good friend
[SPEAKER_00]: and Charlie and Doobie and all those guys,
you know, on the, on the, in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time I had passed out a bunch
of seeds and, you know, I've been just
[SPEAKER_00]: giving away seeds and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I got tired of that and it was
just kind of a way to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to not have to go to the post office
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made a bunch of seeds and had gypsy
and others distribute them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it allowed me, you know,
to not have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so let's go, let's rewind a little bit
then.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what was your introduction to the
online community?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause as you just mentioned, you know,
you were giving out seeds to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you discover the forums and come
to be a part of the online community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gosh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was, you know, cannabis world and
overgrow, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe a friend showed it to me or
something back, I don't know, 99 or
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever it was, you know, 2000,
whenever those, those things were.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And prior to that, were you mostly just,
you know, mingling with the locals and
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of just doing your own thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I had a computer or
something prior to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Truly a mountain man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go, let's go back a little bit
before that then.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it like living in the area you
were before the online communities?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, cause this is largely regarded
by a lot of people as like probably the
[SPEAKER_04]: golden era of NorCal cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that how you would describe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I would for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was such a, a really great and
different group of people that settled
[SPEAKER_00]: this area, you know, back in that original
rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, late seventies or something
started probably, you know, early
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties, you know, there was every hash
smuggler and, you know, hippie and weed
[SPEAKER_00]: dealer from down in the city started
buying property up here and, and came up
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and there's people up here from,
you know, all over the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a really interesting community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot's changed from since back
then, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of newer people up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new guard we call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vibe's probably not what it used
to be, but I still love it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been here for 37 years, I think this
is my 37th year and I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, incredible, incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess a lot of people currently are
discussing the way farmers are being
[SPEAKER_04]: pushed out of the industry with the ever
increasing legalization and the like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the more corporate farms coming
into the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this something you're concerned about
or do you think like it sort of doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: affect you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it doesn't, doesn't concern me too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it doesn't, doesn't affect me
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm going to do what I've always
done and Hey, you know, we, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, there's not really good folk
going to jail for a long time,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they, like it was back in the old
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's a win and nothing else,
you know, this other stuff, there was no
[SPEAKER_00]: money in it back in the beginning,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's not much money in
it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like we've come full circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a, that's a good analogy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's lots of people who,
who, who kind of rode this gold rush in
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and there was a lot of undesirable,
you know, entities out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came with that and I'm, I'm kind of
glad to see them go, to be gone,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of these big farms are
closing up shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they can't even make it work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, true, true.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard a lot of them yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just putting out a lot of volume,
but not a lot of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just, you know, they can't,
they can't deliver to their, to their
[SPEAKER_00]: lenders, you know, what, what they
promised back when, you know, back when it
[SPEAKER_00]: was worth more a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess, I guess an interesting
sort of direction to take this in is that
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of people would look at many of your
offerings over the years and sort of think
[SPEAKER_04]: to himself, these aren't necessarily the
most commercially orientated plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you found that you are able to grow
your strains and offerings in a way that
[SPEAKER_04]: they aren't viable or are they more of
like a unique tool that's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_04]: for production in your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could, you could probably
grow a deep chunk in a, in a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: light a single 1000 watt light over an
area, over an area like 12 feet by 12 feet
[SPEAKER_00]: or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'd probably get a couple of pounds
out of that light with that set up and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll produce out on the edges because
it's a low light plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we used to grow it under the
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, with haze, you could find a
killer clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, sell ounces for $400
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those can be commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's two sort of totally different ends
of the spectrum, but you're making it
[SPEAKER_04]: work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really liked that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd love to hear a bit more about the
deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I think I read a post where you,
you said a similar sentiment about,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, lower light levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess sort of the implication is that
you could maybe run like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: twice as big of a space with half the
lighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, the same sort of power bill,
but get twice as much yield sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that sort of what you're getting at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you can, if you can fudge
with the inputs, then, then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, this is an old plant and up here
in the old days, we were growing under the
[SPEAKER_00]: trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had helicopters all up on us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for a plant to do well underneath a
Manzanita or my drone or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: under a fucking tree, it has to be able to
boogie down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some lower light levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look, I, uh, in the past, I,
I've grown deep chunk inside a tent and I
[SPEAKER_04]: actually found it quite challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this may well be the reason I
was probably suffocating it with light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a low light plant for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, and it works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we try to grow all that debt stuff
under the trees up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that shit comes out so wispy that
you're just not even going to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're going to be working at
7-Eleven or something, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: that deep chunk is going to throw them
monkey balls in the shade no matter what.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you just referenced haze and you
said, you know, you could find a really
[SPEAKER_04]: nice pheno, you could do really well with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was interested to ask you, do you find
that you're able to get enough yield off
[SPEAKER_04]: the haze that it like, it makes up for the
spindly sort of structure or the quality
[SPEAKER_04]: is enough that it equals out that way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I, I mean, I've never, I've never
grown them commercially by clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing from seed and, um,
you know, the seed plant in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: or something, it'll do a couple of pounds,
you know, it'll give you a kilo or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if the smoke is right, then,
you know, a kilo of haze is extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: precious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it yields enough, um,
because it's just, it's so much better
[SPEAKER_00]: than everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's really, it's priceless,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And out of curiosity, have you ever been
tempted to, uh, pass out, uh, a clone or a
[SPEAKER_04]: seedling or you just, you don't really
take cuttings at all of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm probably going to run a haze run
pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny, funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, I would love to have a haze
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you find a good haze clone,
buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can change the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be a really,
really unique sort of offering to bring to
[SPEAKER_04]: the table because although there's like a
lot of focal discussion around haze,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I've heard anyone sort of
float the idea of doing that in the sense
[SPEAKER_04]: that you might.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's like, it's real,
real high up on my project list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been growing all this stuff
for the market for, for so many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, uh, now it's the perfect time,
you know, because the prices are down and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you can take a vacation from what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not getting paid anyway,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's like the perfect, now it's
like the perfect time to do something
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And out of curiosity, you know,
a minute or two ago, you mentioned Gelato
[SPEAKER_04]: 33.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think a Gelato 33 haze hybrid would
be interesting or it's a bit too muddled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I find a cerebral, uh,
you know, fast flowering hybrid,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about haze, you know, yeah,
this one might squash the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might not squash the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always, I'm always on the hunt for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that the OG would probably
be an interesting one because OG is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a plant that, uh, it's proven itself to
breed true for, for this high resin
[SPEAKER_00]: content and quality resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's, that's a pretty rare
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are, those are some pretty important
boxes to be checking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it certainly does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a parent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think with haze, you have this like
sort of a notable 5% rule.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you be able to run over that one for
the listeners who aren't familiar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, about one in 20 is, is,
is going to be really exceptional.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you'll get it, you'll get a
few that are okay, but you'll get this
[SPEAKER_00]: giant percentage of them, uh, more than
50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll be, that you'll, you know,
at least I would say, oh man, this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's a real pain in the ass
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to rifle through all these
undesirable plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but you know, if you find a good
one, it just, it makes it all worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to you, the ones that are truly the
keeper ones, what sort of traits do they
[SPEAKER_04]: embody in terms of a lot of people talk
about hazes as like this Fina is maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: Colombian leaning.
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's more Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you describe the ones that you
feel are the ultimate keepers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the Thai side of the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's kind of a citrusy, probably
lemonine or something, uh, same going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a sour apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of like back in the early
eighties, like some of the last Thai
[SPEAKER_00]: shipments that were coming in,
we call it chocolate Thai here in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was really, really good stuff,
but if you grew that stuff out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would get this, this very similar
thing to the haze that I grow and it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's, and it's kind of makeup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, as someone who unfortunately
has never been able to try any like Thai
[SPEAKER_04]: stick or anything like that, were there
any other Thai varieties that left like a
[SPEAKER_04]: lasting impression on you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the early, the earlier Thai stick
that probably was the foundation of
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaiian weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, um, it was a real spicy thing
and, you know, and it would blow up in
[SPEAKER_00]: your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't hold that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they called it expando bud,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was most certainly, uh, Thai hybrids
that were grown in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that stuff in the early eighties
was, was just insanely, uh, potent and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, just rip your head clean off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'd only ever tried like a
Hawaiian lime once, and it kind of weirdly
[SPEAKER_04]: reminded me of sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever had that sort of experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, well, I wouldn't imagine,
I wouldn't be surprised if it was sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but Hawaii got hit hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I'm, I'm sitting here
whining about camp and all that in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Hawaii got it much, much worse,
you know, with this operation green sweep,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they, whatever they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would, they have guys hanging from
helicopters off a rope and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, combing the, combing the,
the forests, like, you know, just a few
[SPEAKER_00]: feet from the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really hard to grow for a long time
in Hawaii, uh, from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Reagan, from Reagan on, uh, for,
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and a lot of the old stuff just
got wiped out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever tried to grow any Hawaiian
or it was always sort of like just
[SPEAKER_04]: adjacent?
[SPEAKER_04]: To what you're interested in?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's a neighbor here that,
um, that used to grow some Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might even still, but it just,
it wasn't very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it wasn't like the stuff I
remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't suppose you ever had the mythical
Maui Waui or?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, none of the stuff that we got from
Hawaii had names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, um, it was, you know, brown or green,
baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those take your pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, and we knew back then
the brown was fucking good, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was, and, and there was another
Thai trade, I reckon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That does sound very Thai-esque,
doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the more brown quote it goes,
like the better it gets.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't hear people saying that about
many varieties, except for Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's, you know, I mean,
there's some of my favorite Maui modern
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties will go brown too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, chem four doesn't hold onto
its color for very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to move that shit quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, four, four months after you take
that stuff down, it's going brown,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, look, you just said one of the,
the favorite varieties of the show,
[SPEAKER_04]: the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_04]: What, what's your experience with the chem
dog?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you grown many of the different cuts
or just the four?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown the 91, the D and the four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And any one of them sort of more of a
favorite than the others or they're all
[SPEAKER_04]: just sort of good in their own way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked that chem four the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, I wasn't a very big fan of the 91
and the way that it grew, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, it just doesn't do a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The D is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little earlier outdoors and it
makes a nice bud and does all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I think the four, all things
considered how it grows and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how it hits your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the four was probably the best,
my favorite anyway, and that's all I care
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I can understand where you're coming
from, especially being outdoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think the 91 does need a lot
of, uh, you know, babying a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: coddling, as we might say.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that sort of all checks out.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the focal discussion points on the
show we talk about with guests is what do
[SPEAKER_04]: we think the lineage is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause we still don't really know what chem
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people say, you know,
Northern lights, something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any sort of guesses?
[SPEAKER_04]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's, you know, uh,
it's really good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, a combination of what came
before it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably some, you know, awesome
transgressive segregation up to a bag seed
[SPEAKER_00]: from some dude's closet back in 82 or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look, I love that term transgressive
segregation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me and you have spoken about it a bit in
our personal chats, but I have a feeling
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the listeners may not be familiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you give your sort of basic,
um, you know, description of what
[SPEAKER_04]: transgressive segregation is for the
viewers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, there's, you know, there's
hybrid, bigger, you know, heterosis and
[SPEAKER_00]: the F1 where you kind of have weaker
traits of one parent being masked by the
[SPEAKER_00]: input of another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and so, you know, everybody likes
F1s because they kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're, they're not weak plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice and uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of, but it's kind of mid parent
values.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly it's predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's why seed companies used to
do it and such, but, uh, it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: fly off the charts in any, in any,
in any category, uh, that doesn't happen
[SPEAKER_00]: until you get into the F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, um, that's when you get very
extreme, uh, phenotypes, uh, that you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't seen before in either parental
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, that's where the fun begins too,
whether you're just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting clones or, or selecting breeding
prospects.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brilliant stuff there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is sort of a topic we talk
about on the show, but have maybe never
[SPEAKER_04]: actually correctly labeled it as
transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just so I'm trying to get in the
mindset of the listener, you're sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: saying like, it's when you get a result
that you wouldn't be able to predict from
[SPEAKER_04]: either parents.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like something totally left of field,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a measurement
that this, this thing is doing in one,
[SPEAKER_00]: in some category, um, where it's,
it's measurements lie outside the range of
[SPEAKER_00]: either parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, so, you know, so we're,
we're talking about, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: faster than a speeding bullet,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, frost, frostier than the DC and
more cerebral than Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, that's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be an example of
transgressive segregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, um, and it's not, it's not
something that doesn't happen often,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's actually, it's,
it's more of the rule than the exception.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's a great answer there
because I was going to ask some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: most exciting results of a cross in my
opinion are exactly that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when you get something very sort
of unexpected.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you use more land race or pure
breeding strains, I think you tend to see
[SPEAKER_04]: this occur more.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my question is, do you feel that
transgressive segregation can still occur
[SPEAKER_04]: with two poly hybrids?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's just harder to come across or do
you really need that pure breeding strain
[SPEAKER_04]: to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it can happen with any introducing
any new, you know, new germplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but the more, the more divergent the
original parental lines are, the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: the incidence of transgressive segregation
that you'll see in the following
[SPEAKER_00]: populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if someone's looking to like get them,
put their name on the map to establish,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, some reputation for themselves,
do you think this is a good route to
[SPEAKER_04]: travel?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do you think this might be sort of
good advice for an aspiring breeder in
[SPEAKER_04]: terms of how you can make something
unique?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, that's, that's where,
that's where, you know, new starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, um, and then you, and then you would
take, you know, you would, you would,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would pick several, you know,
let's say candidates or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, if from the F2 generation set them
aside and, and, and then, and then breed
[SPEAKER_00]: them and then, and then you'd rank their
progeny and say, okay, this one was worth
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding with and this one wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's the way it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is, this is pretty standard
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is how, you know,
corn breeding is done or anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's what breeders do is,
is they, you know, try to slam two things
[SPEAKER_00]: together, get into the, you know,
the later generations and find something
[SPEAKER_00]: exceptional and try to, try to make
families out of these, out of these like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, individuals and, and some of the
families will, will succeed and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them will fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, you're just crunching
numbers, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely a lot of things the
cannabis community can learn from like
[SPEAKER_04]: modern agriculture that we're sort of only
just picking up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's use the monkey haze as a sort of
reference.
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you go about finding that unique
phenotype?
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got your F1 seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you go from there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you just pop those and try to find that
phenome?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: F1 seeds, I would, I would breed them into
them, into themselves and come to the F2
[SPEAKER_00]: before I, before I'd even start looking
for anything strangely new and excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if someone wanted to really try to do
this, they really need to be in the F2 or
[SPEAKER_04]: beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the goal of this F2 generation is,
as you, I think you mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_04]: something more resinous than the deep
chunk, but with that haze effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be S2.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just talking about recombination
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the F1, anything after you,
it could be a first generation backcross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the next step after F1 is when you're
going to get some recombination happening
[SPEAKER_00]: within the genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and when you reshuffle the deck
like that, that's when, that's when shit
[SPEAKER_00]: gets interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And out of like a personal curiosity,
when you've done this in the past,
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotypically, do the plants,
look like they might look like one parent,
[SPEAKER_04]: they might look like the other,
you just got to hunt them through,
[SPEAKER_04]: or is that sort of keep a pheno looking
like a 50-50?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, the F1 will be 50-50, but the F2,
it's all over the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have a massive variation,
but that's, that's what you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a seed buyer would probably hate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he bought a pack of seeds and it was
all across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but if you're, but if you're going on
the hunt, I mean, that, that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, that's what you're looking for,
aren't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, show me as many different cards
as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so with the monkey haze, I think
there's like a really notable photo online
[SPEAKER_04]: of this beautiful looking plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I had to guess, I would say that it
sort of looks like a slightly more haze
[SPEAKER_04]: leaning plant, but it's obviously got that
resin from the deep chunk that we talked
[SPEAKER_04]: about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Has that been your experience in the past
that they, because you're looking for that
[SPEAKER_04]: haze effect, you sort of are looking for a
haze type plant or not necessarily,
[SPEAKER_04]: you could get like a full deep chunk squat
indica looking plant that had that haze
[SPEAKER_04]: effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it's just the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've struck out until now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't gone through a bunch of them,
but that's a hard thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because haze by itself is really,
really excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and, um, you know, let's say,
let's say deep chunks through a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: extra resin on it, uh, to the naked eye or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, when you, when you
started examining the resin head size and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, it just doesn't measure up to what
haze was doing by itself already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, deep chunk can have incredibly big
resin heads too, but, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting, getting to find those plants,
um, is always tough, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because, because it can look more frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, you know, you were telling me
the other, you know, before about some
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that, Oh man, it's just a resin bomb
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I want to look close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a bunch of, is it a bunch of Stipe
cells?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, is there a big head size there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see that big head size,
you know, with anything that I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, that that's,
uh, that those are the storage containers
[SPEAKER_00]: of what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, the bigger the vessel,
the better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful answer there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree just for anyone listening,
we were talking about the Mac and I think
[SPEAKER_04]: you actually, without knowing much about
it, hit it perfectly on the head.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people say that there's a lot of
like, uh, resin stalks, but not
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily the heads.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, you know, what's, is that really
useful?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, there, there's no Tori.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our train wreck was like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern lights was like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there, there's a big,
long list of plants and modern man,
[SPEAKER_00]: modern plants too, you know, modern clones
that are, you know, all hyped up and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get them and look at them and
it's a, you know, it's, it's a,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an empty vessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really small heads and, and, and,
you know, just a bunch of, a forest of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of, of stalks and, um, and, and they don't
get too high, you know, uh, in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience that, that the big head,
you know, uh, individuals do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously a lot of people listening,
very keen to hear about some of the old
[SPEAKER_04]: school days, some of the history,
but before we get there, you just
[SPEAKER_04]: referenced, you know, the hype strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to quickly touch on that first.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people listening to this
would be keen to hear what you like out of
[SPEAKER_04]: the more modern genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm wondering how to say the past 20
years since like OG Kush, what has
[SPEAKER_04]: impressed you?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think is good weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the cams and the OGs and, and,
uh, gosh, that's put me on a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's a bunch of them,
the haze, the haze, you know, all the haze
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff out of, you know, that, that people
are hunting down those, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those, uh, that East coast haze and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that stuff's, uh, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these, uh, Northern light haze
type things that are around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, gosh, you know, there's no,
if I was growing outdoor, I'd be saying
[SPEAKER_00]: something like salmon Creek or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some big, there's some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and, and even blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, I think everybody's just
kind of growing for this market and not
[SPEAKER_00]: growing for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, you try to be honest
about what you really like and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and you should stick to that
because, uh, the market is ever changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people get burnt out on,
on, on really good plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every really good plant comes along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody grows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market gets burnt out, demand
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody stops growing this really
fucking good plant, you know, that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Hey dude, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, you know, don't fucking shit can
this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fucking fabulous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, their buyers don't want it,
don't want it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had too much shove down their
throat and they move on and nobody keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really good plants get lost like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, how about I narrow it down for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I know that you are a very talented
outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk outdoor varieties for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of the MVPs for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you like to grow outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, blue dream, let's see salmon Creek
bid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big bud train wreck was a good one
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just any plant that'll get,
that can get really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we were messing around, you know,
we, we used to be able to grow 25 or
[SPEAKER_00]: something in Mendocino County here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so, you know, everybody finally
poked their head out from underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: trees and started, you know, doing these
big, uh, you know, big plant grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you want the plan to be as big as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I've made the mistake of
growing my, you know, like sour diesel and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and the same, same outdoor
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that stuff doesn't grow very
well at all outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, blue dream was fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I even liked blue dream as a
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend over up at CSI, he laughs
and laughs and laughs at me about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but, but that's my honest
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is that plant was a pretty good smoke
and it was fucking absolutely bulletproof
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and a host of other categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that, and that, that,
that matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: That matters a lot, you know, when you're
evaluating plants and, and what,
[SPEAKER_00]: what does it fucking matter?
[SPEAKER_00]: At least to me is, you know, whether or
not the fucking market wants it or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm not going to, not going to,
you know, you know, grow, grow for that
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually I'm full of shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been doing exactly that,
but shame on me for doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can all relate to that in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: You did reference the Salmon Creek,
uh, big bud, which is a very interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: strain because it's hard to get
information on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I would be interested to hear what
was your opinion on the high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause a lot of people like to barn humbug,
big bud and say he's just a cash crop
[SPEAKER_04]: strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't good, but there are a lot of
people who say, well, the Salmon Creek one
[SPEAKER_04]: was actually really special.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably say it was like a high B and,
uh, go with the former opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a cash crop thing,
but it was, it was, you know, it was
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable and stuff, but yeah,
it just grew really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just absolutely bulletproof and
it could come out really well,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you, you know, indoors and stuff,
I've seen it look really, really good,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, it wasn't all that maybe a high
B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly not grade a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, out of curiosity, you,
you said that sour diesel doesn't grow
[SPEAKER_04]: particularly well outdoors, which,
you know, that's, that's definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: something we hear around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you a fan of indoor sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause there was certainly a time where it
sort of took everyone, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: by storm.
Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't the chems around by then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were around before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like sour diesel, you know,
it's, it's, it's a good high, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it's like a 30 minute high,
man, you know, after 30 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just like, you got to smoke more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd probably great for the guys out on
the block, sling it, sling in 20 bags or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, you know, I mean, if it,
it, it wasn't something that I would,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I would want to keep around because
of the duration of the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that fucking plant, uh,
processes better into concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, than any other plan I've seen in
decades, decades.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a big concentrate guy or more into
flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more into flower and, you know,
if you got a toothache or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to grab reach for something
stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm in massive pain, I'll, I'll,
you know, I'll turn to hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with the, the sour diesel and you just
reference, you know, its ability to make
[SPEAKER_04]: really good concentrates, are you,
are you a bubble guy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you like BHO or source or like
whatever?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a preference really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that plant, sour diesel,
it's like the first one that I've seen go
[SPEAKER_00]: through all of those things you just
listed and, and still be able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to be able to be identified.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so, so many plants, uh,
you run, you run it through water
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction and, and, um, it all just,
it tastes like generic hash after,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, smells like generic hash,
all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen, uh, sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was, you know, BHL propane and,
and, uh, and smoke like sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's essence just comes through
with flying colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, you know, for all of its faults as
a grower, as a, you know, as a plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, uh, it makes up for it in that
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a flower doesn't last long of a high,
but otherwise, you know, it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, but the low, you know, bottom half
of it's going to be empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, you know, it just got such as
inter nodal length and all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: things that go against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're trying to grow it
outdoors, that it wasn't a, it wasn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: contender for the big pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that classification system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a contender for a big pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, out of curiosity on the other end of
the spectrum, you know, you were saying it
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't last very long.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some strains to you that you feel
really have the legs and go the mile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this one I just smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get with my neighbor and ask
them what the hell it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Hazel, Hazel, Hazel put you down for
like four hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would really, really long high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh gee.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, OG will knock you out for a
couple hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think, I think the cams too are real
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but most, most, most varieties that
I've tried, uh, recently, nothing stands
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, the old tie or anything,
uh, or, you know, or a haze that can,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, you're going into four or
five hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, nothing, not as modern stuff does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I've tried recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the haze, let's go back to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What, like, what was your introduction?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you get the haze seeds and what
sort of stimulated you to do it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you hear magical things about haze?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, Hey, I got to check that
out myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, that's a funny, that's a funny
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, and I think it was 93 or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got camped on up here, you know,
helicopters came and took all my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there was, they could see it
through the Manzanita.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was packed full under there,
you know, probably changed the color of
[SPEAKER_00]: the green of that Manzanita for those
helicopters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, stick out like a sore thumb,
but, um, so the plan was to go deeper in
[SPEAKER_00]: the shade, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get camped on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I was taken in by those damn
brochures from, from all the seed banks
[SPEAKER_00]: back then, you know, about how Durban
poison will produce good chunky buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: even during the worst season and all this
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking Amsterdam, like that's a
place is a fucking foggy, cloudy mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you even get any sun over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, if it produces good there,
maybe I could take that shit under some
[SPEAKER_00]: deeper cover and still be able to produce
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, away I went on my seed,
on my seed, you know, journey to go get
[SPEAKER_00]: all this awesome variety that I was
reading about in this brochure,
[SPEAKER_00]: in these brochures and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got there and, uh, you know,
and I would go out and I would go get
[SPEAKER_00]: samples from all the different coffee
shops and have them all labeled and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and try them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I liked one, I would find out
where they had these seeds for this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I go about it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the haze they were selling,
so there was some really good haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would have been the winter of 94,
95.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I was there over Christmas
and all that and new years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there was some really good haze from,
from one of the older coffee shops at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot who had it, but, but it was,
and it was kind of Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that stuff was really, really good and
really trippy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I already had haze seed on my list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to find those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but even though, even after I got it,
man, I kept going to buy more of that haze
[SPEAKER_00]: for the rest of my trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of fucked up my, my testing,
you know, I was supposed to be supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: be testing all these varieties,
but it's like fucking haze was all I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and I finally found it,
you know, they had it all over town and
[SPEAKER_00]: various hybrid forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff, and I bought a few of those
too, but I could only find it at
[SPEAKER_00]: Positronics then, uh, that said it was in
pure form.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And out of curiosity, did you end up
picking up any other seeds on that trip
[SPEAKER_04]: that ended up being like a memorable
variety?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or was it really just haze that cut it?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was 27 varieties I brought back,
I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it was just a haze that I ended
up keeping in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, my friend liked one of the,
one of the early skunks, uh, that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think Sam had at the time through
Positronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that was a plant that,
that delivered up here, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: most people are harvesting beginning to
mid October and this, this thing was out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ground by, you know, by mid
September or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and that meant a lot up here,
you know, an extra month of, of not having
[SPEAKER_00]: to evade camp and stuff, you know,
so he really liked that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't particularly good smoke or
anything, but it made him a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was certainly a good grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you got back and you're
growing them out, what was it like that
[SPEAKER_04]: first time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember like the Fino hunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my friend, my friends still have songs
were created about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you know, we tried to grow
these things in kind of our normal shady
[SPEAKER_00]: spots and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and none of them produced anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close to decent, but you know,
these things are used to being selected
[SPEAKER_00]: under lights and stuff and all,
you know, they work really well indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can't take that shit under the
shade, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it grows stuff that, that buyers
would even back then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: would turn their nose up at, and that,
and back then people would take anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they were lucky to know a grower
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, but yeah, oh, it got me mad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, it was horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a horrible experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've hated everything from, from Holland
since, just, just kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what was it like when, so I'm,
I'm assuming you, you like F to them and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then grew them again.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, that was when you found sort of
the magic or how did that happen when you
[SPEAKER_04]: actually were able to get something good
off it and were like, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I had like 60 seeds or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, uh, I think, uh, positronics sold 15
seeds per pack back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had like four of them or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I grew up 10 the first year and I
found a really fucking good plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Holy fucking shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this stuff is really fucking
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nothing like the haze I was smoking
on the street in Amsterdam though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was more of the,
that one that, that, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that Chanty and Neville and all them work
with, which is, it was more of a kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: leathery, uh, insensy thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teak would kind of a flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the one I had grew was totally
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what the hell is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, this isn't the shit I was smoking,
but, uh, but I said, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: double take fuck, but it's really fucking
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and said, so I knew that there was
good stuff in it, but I didn't save a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do any breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, fuck later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I wish I didn't even grow
those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I immediately went to open pollination out
of that and made more seeds, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the 50 or so seeds or whatever I had
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I've, you know, I've, I've just
opened pollinated since then, but it did
[SPEAKER_00]: start with a population of 50,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, lovely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like that, but I've always
opened pollinated them and I've tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it in various, you know, I've done
half seed selection on it and I've tried
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, collect seeds only from my
favorite, you know, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're basically saving seeds from,
you know, your male pollen mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these different haze girls in a
greenhouse and whichever your favorite is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, set aside those seeds from it
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have said, have said, because of the
male pollen mix, but, um, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't know, I've never really
made any progress with it, to be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it still sits there kind of
right where it was at 5% kick your ass
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and a whole bunch of hay and,
you know, a few ones, other ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't worth right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Home about, but you thought we're going to
be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, but that small percentage is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so because I've never made any,
any progress with it, if I'm, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: going to grow some out, um, I reach for
the open pollination shit, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause it's less bread and, um,
it has the same damn ratio as,
[SPEAKER_00]: as anything that I tried to make any
progress with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hold more value on the open pollination
seed doc pays than I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_04]: But before we jump into some open
pollination stuff, I've got to ask that
[SPEAKER_04]: first time you ran them, that key,
that killer plant you got, have you,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, how would you describe that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you said, you know, it was different
to the Amsterdam stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And have you seen that phenotype pop up
again since then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's when it's on, when,
when it's good, it's a really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good, good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just incredibly potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, you know, geez, I've walked into
the bathroom and looked at myself in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mirror and like, talk to my stuff and so
I'm high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so fucking high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and, uh, and that's really
silly shit, you know, uh, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, there's nothing else out there
that'll make you do that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you'll be, you know, looking
around for your telephone, using the
[SPEAKER_00]: flashlight on your fucking telephone,
you know, where's my phone is in your
[SPEAKER_00]: hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll just, you just have these
moments of, holy shit, I'm fucking high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and Hayes is really, uh,
you know, it's, it's number one at doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_04]: What sort of flavors and terpenes did it
have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's like, I just, I just call it
really tie-like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of citrusy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some, there's a bunch of weird
stuff going on in Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it a high school metal shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like their stems will, will smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like almost like metal, like high school
metal shop, like oil, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: machine oil and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's got some really weird evil kind
of smells going on, but the ones that I
[SPEAKER_00]: usually gravitate towards will have a,
have a citrusy kind of, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, lovely.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to delve into the open
pollination stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause as you mentioned, it's, uh,
one of your preferred breeding techniques,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least with the hay.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you go through and do an open
pollination on the technical level?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you, do you cull any plants?
[SPEAKER_04]: What sort of criteria would you use if you
were going to cull anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, um, I would, uh, well,
I, I would say I try to shoot for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at least a hundred plants in an
open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it's not to back yourself in too
much of a corner, um, or as many as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can, you know, if you could do more,
great, you know, more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is better, you know, so you're not,
so you're not losing anything that you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, but there's a couple of
instances also where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want the, the population to sway
in any one direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I have an early male that's coming
along, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, this guy's about ready to shoot
his load and every other male in the room
[SPEAKER_00]: is behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go ahead and top that male and cut
his input back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, lessen his, his effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want him robbing them,
having to lie and share a pollination in
[SPEAKER_00]: the room just because he was earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that, that, that's, you know,
it's leaving out too, too many other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that you probably are going to want
there in the end, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you pay much attention to like runs
or anything like, you know, things that
[SPEAKER_04]: are like sort of lacking in compared to
the others or you're not too fussed about
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just let it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Old guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I include them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I include them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they might, they, they could,
who the fuck knows, you know, they,
[SPEAKER_00]: there might be correlations that we have
no fucking idea about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, it's, you know, have you,
has anybody in the world ever that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, seen this massive yielding
perfect plant that also happens to rip
[SPEAKER_00]: your head off, you know, and it seems like
they shouldn't be, you know, it shouldn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean, it's not even like
hitting the lotto.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're fucking unicorns.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I don't know that I'm not going to
leave them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let, I'm going to let them,
I'm going to let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, their, their input
would be small, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're just a fucking runt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting way to think about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not too worried about fucking up
the population at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're, what you're worried about
when you're doing this is including
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as big as numbers as possible and just
stand back and then just, and just let
[SPEAKER_00]: that happen though, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to kind of, you know,
like I said, you have to guard that like
[SPEAKER_00]: an early male doesn't pollinate
everything, you know, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, weeks before the other males shed any
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that would be catastrophe,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the one thing I do keep an eye
out is early males and I'll just cut them
[SPEAKER_00]: back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll turn them into a runt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say, just because you're early,
you know, it doesn't, doesn't mean you get
[SPEAKER_00]: the lion's share of being a daddy,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I think that gives you a nice,
uh, you know, mix of genetics and the open
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's good to hear that you keep
them all in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I think a lot of people would
sort of cull those early ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, I'm going to give that a go
next time I do an open pollination is just
[SPEAKER_04]: topping it, but leaving it in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you still get that mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, you can mess with their,
you know, if anything's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it looks like it's going to get the lion's
share of pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can just, you know,
lessen that plant's input really easy with
[SPEAKER_00]: a pair of puck and scissors in the room,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to loop back to Hayes for a second,
you know, it seems like it's had this
[SPEAKER_04]: massive resurgence, probably around the
time Neville passed, it started to gain a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of traction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we're now starting to see more
and more Hayes has come out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: woodworks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do you think Hayes is becoming so
popular?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it's just people are
realizing there are these really special
[SPEAKER_04]: Finos?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the market's just coming around again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were probably, you know,
it was, it was been super popular before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, and then everybody fucking had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the fucking buyer said,
Hey man, we don't want anything but
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, great plants come along and
that's what happens to a man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get shit canned because there's
pressure coming from outside to deliver
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's what happens with the really
good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come back, you know, a couple of
years later, when everybody gets sick of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the newest kid on the block is,
these, these buyers and customers,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they'll come back and they'll say,
Hey man, you got any of that fucking old
[SPEAKER_00]: shit still?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they, they miss it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have, they have to, you know,
come around in their head that this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this was a really fucking good plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Hayes is, it really is, you know,
it's one of the, one of the best plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in, you know, in modern history for sure,
with zero doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that you have such a passion for
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a little bit earlier, you did
reference NL5 Hayes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to hear your thoughts in
terms of like, do you think they're
[SPEAKER_04]: comparable or are they just totally
different beasts in your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in most categories they're better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, they certainly,
any hybrid will certainly yield better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen them have big giant heads,
you know, our friend, or the community,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obsolete.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some incredible macros with
these big giant heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there, there's some great parents in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's zero doubt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've smoked some that completely
ripped my head off too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're both great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's great stuff and all of
the, those Hayes lines, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just have to be willing to run,
run the numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And have you tried any of the current
popular ones like the PIF or the Cuban
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Hayes?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither one of those that I know of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a couple of people who have had it
and I've been meaning to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I hear the stuff described,
it sounds a lot like the stuff that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking out of the coffee shops in,
you know, in Amsterdam in 94, late 94,
[SPEAKER_00]: early 95.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you mentioned it being like
incense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is how these Hayes cuts are
described.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stuff was really spacey too,
you know, it's a really cool, a really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool visual and audio kind of trippy high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And can we maybe expect to see some Hayes
seeds being offered from you at some point
[SPEAKER_04]: in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I like the idea of finding a,
yeah, I'll be running Hayes always,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean, I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to not grow some Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like I said, now's a great
time to do it because the market's so
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can kind of take a little
vacation and do what you really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm actually, I more care about
finding, I have plenty of Hayes seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more excited about finding a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because I've never really done
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never, never saved a Hayes clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fuck, I've seen so many of them go by
from seed that I should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've saved, you know, and, you know,
it'd be a pain in the butt to grow even
[SPEAKER_00]: from even from clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty fucking special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it stacks up against anything,
anything when it's when it's on.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, and like, is your idea to breed with
it or like sort of disseminate it out to
[SPEAKER_04]: the community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd love to have it, you know,
out in people's hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if I would breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'd stick with Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just and all my old lines,
I just stick with open pollination as
[SPEAKER_00]: least frequently as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the best possible storage
in the interim.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen you post about your seed storage
online.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you like to store seeds long term?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't have much of a choice up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bury them under the frost, under the
frost levels, under the frost level and
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas will be different depths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, it's about, I don't know,
two and a half, three feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you dig a hole about three feet deep
and get an army.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ammo can has a good seal on it and such to
keep ammunition dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are good storage containers for
burying seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about, you know, it's not as good
as a refrigerator, but it's about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think 55 degrees Fahrenheit or
something, earth temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't vary a lot from summer to
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't freeze and it doesn't bake
during the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about like burying them in King
Tut's tomb, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty good option.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but refrigerator would be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were always concerned about getting
busted, you know, back in the old days,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get busted and they and they take
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you didn't want to have them around
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want any nothing safe until it's in
the bank of the woods around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We bury everything that has any value.
[SPEAKER_00]: My seed stash has always come into that
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep another ammo can that's not buried.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, you know, kind of a remnant seed
thing that I use for handing out and
[SPEAKER_00]: sending out and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't keep as well as the stuff
that I bury and let set there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you have like a certain time frame
you like to like, you know, every five
[SPEAKER_04]: years I restock it or like what,
how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do a germ test, you know, germination test
and and write down what percentage you got
[SPEAKER_00]: up, you know, every five years or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, stored well, they'll go 20 years
at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually try to open pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: After about 10 years when when when or
when whenever you get close to 50 percent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you have a germ test that's down
to 60 percent or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better get you better get going again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you referenced a few questions ago,
you know, that like popular strains come
[SPEAKER_04]: back in fashion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to know, it seems like the
peak or maybe just over the peak of the
[SPEAKER_04]: roadkill skunk obsession, did you ever
have any experience with it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if so, do you think it's worth the
hype?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these these these hills were filled
with all that stuff back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super, you know, it was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most of the Ghanis and Pakistan,
we came up in here, the broadleafs that
[SPEAKER_00]: came up through here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it, I would say, was skunk,
was very skunky, you know, old school and
[SPEAKER_00]: old school manner or definition rather.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, everybody bred away with
it, away from it, you know, that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and they wouldn't have if it was worth
the hype now, would they?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's just not a very exciting
profile, really, to be honest with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because other ones in the end,
for the most part, have won the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for one reason or another,
you know, there's only a few of them
[SPEAKER_00]: around today, you know, and they're like
cams and, you know, the diesel and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting close to what these guys are
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way more evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the old skunk wasn't so evil as
in these new popular cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so because like what I've heard a lot
of is that the the terp profile,
[SPEAKER_04]: some people have found things similar,
but they're often like not super potent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you say that was your experience
with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that that's the reason that
everybody or, you know, the majority of it
[SPEAKER_00]: got bred out of the gene pool is because
it wasn't the bag that got emptied
[SPEAKER_00]: perished, you know, out of your samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just it didn't it didn't take some
important boxes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then we weren't growing for the
market or what the buyers said that they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could grow whatever we wanted,
you know, because buyers would come up
[SPEAKER_00]: here and buy whatever the fuck you had.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were lucky to know a grower,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back then we had this freedom to to to
grow what we wanted, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could sell anything that we wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just going to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could actually grow what you
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's that's kind of like
what I'm excited about the way the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is now and the prices are so far
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting really close to that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just you can just grow whatever
the fuck you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, I remember you you said a
comment to me that sort of left a lasting
[SPEAKER_04]: impression, which was like the bag of weed
sets the ticket.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the question for a lot of
growers and what they're wondering is
[SPEAKER_04]: like, what can I do to find something
that's going to be able to do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what's going to be impressive enough
that it sets its own ticket?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any advice?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, well, I think historically,
you know, we did it when it started
[SPEAKER_00]: getting imported, you know, by ships into
the harbors here on the West Coast,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, back in the late 70s or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came along.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like eighteen hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: When everything else was like,
you know, two or three hundred dollars at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time, Tyweed certainly hit America by
storm and it was able to write its own
[SPEAKER_00]: ticket as far as how much it's worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Hayes can do the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see anything else doing it
really, you know, but certainly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that whole New York,
that back East Hayes stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff could be pretty expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, certainly it was pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Elite stuff to get a hold of and people
willing to pay a lot of money for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you'll hear Clark talk in the
old days, how like even way back when
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes was going for like four hundred
bucks an ounce or something, something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can do that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you went out and found a kick
ass Hayes clone, you could pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: just decide what you were going to sell it
for and and and people would buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like that because it sort of
flies in the face of what would
[SPEAKER_04]: intuitively seem like the right thing,
which like you might think to yourself,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, I need to like make my own thing and
like become unique through that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's sort of like not necessarily
going to guarantee you're going to get
[SPEAKER_04]: like a really good end product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas with the Hayes, as you said,
like it's tried and tested and no one's
[SPEAKER_04]: filling that niche right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's almost like a space in the market
waiting to be filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm not thinking about it from that
angle, really about the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, the reason that you could
do that with stuff like this is because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just so much fucking better than
anything out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and introducing seed is one
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you introduce Hayes seed,
you're introducing, you know, this big,
[SPEAKER_00]: giant percentage of hay to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's, you know, it's like smoke
and rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's, you know,
that's not that's not so valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you introduced a Hayes clone,
you know, that was just epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now you're doing something for
society, you know, now you're now you're
[SPEAKER_00]: now you're doing well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for anyone out there who's feeling
particularly inspired by listening to
[SPEAKER_04]: this, do you have any recommendations for
growing Hayes indoor or like, do you just
[SPEAKER_04]: like I don't recommend that?
[SPEAKER_00]: My good friend, I guess, CBF, he grows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been growing it indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always grown it in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CBF grew a lot of this of my seed
indoors over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he just tried to flower it out
as fast as he can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still going to be, you know,
six foot plus two meters plus,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what you do, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just becomes a jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I guess just just.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I mean, now from clone, you know,
if you, you know, just started flowering a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone, a rooted clone, that's probably
where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, then I bet you could finish it
up under five feet or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But growing it from seed, good luck,
because that thing is not, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not even going to start flowering for
what, you know, two months if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and then it's going to and then
it's going to keep stretching for like two
[SPEAKER_00]: months after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's a nightmare to not just let
go, you know, go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only imagine just these most
monstrous trees at the end of it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get 15, 20 feet, you know,
if you I've never even really grown it to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to see how big I can grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that type of plant, they get so big,
you know, it'll get huge in in six months
[SPEAKER_00]: of life cycle if you started in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine what it would be like,
like, you know, starting it in the spring
[SPEAKER_00]: and letting it have all summer and then
stretch out through fucking September and
[SPEAKER_00]: October and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, finally come in and
probably November, late November,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in December.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant would be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several meters, probably four or five,
I don't know, six meters, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can totally imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tiger like that up here, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would get huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Setting records.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, you grow a lot of outdoors,
so I'm assuming you're growing in soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you give us a bit of a rundown of how
you grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what sort of amendments do you use?
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything interesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been a big fan of chicken shit
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's a it's a very balanced
food and it lasts about three months or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you know, and that's a pretty
good that's a pretty good amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like bone meal and chicken shit,
but I haven't grown these large outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most of most of everybody,
including myself, have just been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: depths for years, like depths and in
greenhouses, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and that's an even shorter lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, we're going that would be
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the long outdoor season,
I like chicken shit and bone meal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you do like like a super soil sort
of thing in the sense that you put that at
[SPEAKER_04]: the bottom and then some regular soil on
top and then the plants on top of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it just that's the whole medium?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just kind of what I start out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I'll do some feeding
of like fish and and and liquid,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, various organic bottle
nutrients, you know, a couple of times on
[SPEAKER_00]: the outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've got to spend years since I've
really grown outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my outdoor pots now are filled
with mama plants to take fucking cuts off
[SPEAKER_00]: of for the second run on the light depths.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what sort of a feeding and soil regime
do you use for when you're doing light
[SPEAKER_04]: depth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, like you use these these injectors are
real popular where, you know, you grab
[SPEAKER_00]: just grab some age old organic or
something, you know, one of the liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: organic fertilizers and use these these
injectors where it just auto mixes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with the hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can just feed really easy that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the old days of shit running
around with granny cans and dipping them
[SPEAKER_00]: into a slurry of, you know, 55 gallon
barrels filled with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: study are over.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Modern problems require modern solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're asking about soil and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use grow back some some people use
to, you know, make beds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my beds have always scared me a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, they're really easy to
prep and stuff because you can just run a
[SPEAKER_00]: rototiller over the thing, you know,
and until in some amendments, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: each year or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but pathogen ripping through there are
vermin ripping through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you get a wall or something
ripping through your and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be like, you know, gophers tearing
up your bugs, bunny cartoons, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: any type of soil borne pathogen or critter
can wreak havoc in a in a in a raised bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once he gets in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like the I like I like to use grow
bags for that reason, but I do use soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I get a problem in grow bags,
it's isolated to that one singular bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but then feeding it becomes a
nightmare, you know, because you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: just run grip tape or whatever over grow
bags, you have to get a hose on it or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or drip line or something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so those injectors work out really
well for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: The automation and the reduction of labor
is hugely important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was curious, though, in your depths,
do you use any external lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we always used fluorescents in
the past and and but everybody's using
[SPEAKER_00]: these string lights now, and they seem to
work as, you know, as dim as they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They hardly got give up any light and they
use, you know, almost no electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the string lights are like LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: E strings for having cocktail parties in
the suburbs or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: An amazingly low amount of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll keep them in veg when you when
you when you get that early jump in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second one, the hours are
long enough that you're not worried about
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting, you know, and everybody's
everybody was talking about mixed lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: these days and stuff where if they try to,
you know, go too early or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll have some bigger lighting systems
in there to help it along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll play it off like it's
some hybrid system of indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, you know, you don't need to do
that if you grab a bigger chunk of the
[SPEAKER_00]: good growing season.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would love to jump into some of the
old history and the early stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go back to the start.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me, what was your first experience
with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God, I was 14 years old and I smoked
out of a can pipe with with a couple of my
[SPEAKER_00]: friends who I've known since, you know,
junior high and brought both of them up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the mountain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've all done the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've known him forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is that they both own property
up here and such, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that started when I was 14,
probably Mexican weed, some shitty fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: northern northern Mexican weed,
you know, Browntown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in, you know, in the suburbs of L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: or the or the South Bay on the coast
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: About Los Angeles, that's all we had back
then, you know, so you'd get some good
[SPEAKER_00]: green but occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people were smoking Mexican weed
back then.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And did it have a memorable impact on you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I liked it a lot, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would probably smoke the next day,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the day after that and the day after
that for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was about 40 years ago now,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then so what was your progression like
then?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you just begin to smoke more and
eventually you decided you wanted to start
[SPEAKER_04]: growing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what was the transition from casual
smoker to the next level for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Being impressed enough by that tieweed to
that chocolate tie that used to go around
[SPEAKER_00]: in Los Angeles, probably came into Long
Beach Harbor, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it was around those beach cities
of Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, books were coming
out, you know, to teach the backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: growers of the 70s to actually how to grow
some bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, before that, they were like
smoking leaves and shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but it was a book, The Primo Plant,
Jerry Garcia's wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: We called her Mountain Girl back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had written this book, The Primo Plant,
that, you know, ran through, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to grow and how to, you know,
call the males and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that and along with that tieweed,
you know, that's what I wanted to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I was over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to work for this guy that had this
tieweed and he had this big garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was a landscaping business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy loved flowers and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had this big giant rooftop deck and
we would grow a few up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was what we called chocolate tie at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that and and that's why I say that my
favorite Hayes, it's just the same as
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the difference is that chocolate
tie, that seed was it was it was
[SPEAKER_00]: predictable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you grow a couple of those
plants, you know, and they're they were
[SPEAKER_00]: all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was it was it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a what a brilliant introduction and
growing your own chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bet it was delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what happened from then?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you begin to start growing in L.A.?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I happened in somebody who was a
friend of the family who was selling this
[SPEAKER_00]: really killer bud in Santa Monica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was 17 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, hey, man, I've been,
you know, I've been grow out by 16,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually say, I've been growing this stuff
that you've been buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this place in northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you want a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, hell, hell, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's when I came up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a winter of 86, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first crop was in 87.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and I've been here ever since.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, my Lord.
[SPEAKER_04]: So much to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: What like that's such a cool opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you got up there, were there plants
there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you pick the seeds?
[SPEAKER_04]: What were you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the varieties that he had and
everybody else, you know, around the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood had, you know, the chemist
was one guy that had a particularly good
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, everybody in the
neighborhood back there, they would they
[SPEAKER_00]: would share what they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you you grew a little bit
of everything, checked stuff out and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and developed your own favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and that's what I did anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what everybody was doing
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, there was no shortage of
variety, you know, and lots of that's gone
[SPEAKER_00]: by the wayside, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's because they were,
you know, if they were somebody's favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: and they didn't save them, save them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you should you should be honest
with yourself about what your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still got deep chunk and Hayes,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the whole world, if the whole world did
that, you know, cannabis would be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: better off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis culture would be a lot better
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have this awesome gene pool
that was incredibly diverse and that had
[SPEAKER_00]: little pockets of homozygosity and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have true breeding lines that would
develop because they were, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's all they had to your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what that's what you
should be growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be growing what floats your
boat and you should be doing something
[SPEAKER_00]: about that to keep it to keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll come back to that topic because it
is one worth visiting for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you mentioned the chemist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of the information online
says the chemist was your father.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think based on what you just said,
he wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he's just a friend and neighbor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in until this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one of the original guys that,
you know, that were up here when people
[SPEAKER_00]: started coming up and, you know,
realizing, you know, that they could get
[SPEAKER_00]: that they get that same price for that
California green bud up north that that
[SPEAKER_00]: tie was fetching.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it started out about eighteen
hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get a pound of tie or Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's really what changed
everything into into something that where
[SPEAKER_00]: people could make the money up here before
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just back to the landers that were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they were growing some grass,
but it wasn't really for profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was for, you know, putting away over
the winter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what was it like for you to begin
to acquire some of the strains you're
[SPEAKER_04]: known for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, there's the X-18,
the pine tar.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the journey like to pick some of
these strains up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Were they just things that went around?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or did you have to go out of your way to
get them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I used to grow with the chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we we were partners on a few
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I knew all of his lines really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just hit him up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hey, give me this, give me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I was already into the
science of it at the time, which he and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's a real chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's a scientist in his previous
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think he was making the flavor
grape or some shit in a lab somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but he is a scientist and kept really,
really good notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that impressed me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a good grasp of breeding and
that impressed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he so he's been pretty open with his
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just visited me a couple of weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's up in his 70s now or something,
but he's real healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's fantastic to hear that you're
still in touch and that he's doing well.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think I might be wrong here,
but was it the pine tar kush was the X16?
[SPEAKER_04]: 15, I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's D15.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chemist, we call his other nickname is
D and it was number 15 from the chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 18 was to 18.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it sounds like there was a number
of interesting strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it about the other ones which
made you think they weren't quite worth
[SPEAKER_04]: looking into more in the way the ones you
picked were?
[SPEAKER_00]: I snagged the Indian off of him,
too, which was his number nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were these were all of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had a bunch of hybrids and stuff,
but I wasn't interested in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones were the ones that went back to
their parentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because the hybrids were really nice,
too, I was like, same thing like when I
[SPEAKER_00]: went to Holland, I want the fucking
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make my own hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: A man that knows what he wants.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes sense if the other ones were
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in that case, did he ever tell you
where he got some of those things from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the North Indian Indica come
off of Bell Springs Road here in Mendocino
[SPEAKER_00]: County and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the PTK and the X18 come off of another
grower that's still with us in here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same guy that used to grow some Hawaiian
that he got off of him when he did some
[SPEAKER_00]: work with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back then, people used to have
little projects together and such,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they would share in the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's like this stuff that
I'm smoking today, the neighborhood,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, comes over and he wants to show
off this check this stuff out,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it all starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I mean, imagine it's the
same as now, that online shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean, but a whole different
thing, you know, before there was an
[SPEAKER_00]: Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been that same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's got something.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, hey, man, this is really
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to show somebody,
you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's awesome that it was sort of
like this tight knit community.
[SPEAKER_04]: A community of people collaborating
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you mentioned it a few times.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll dive down this rabbit hole now.
[SPEAKER_04]: The North Indian.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a cult following.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think mostly because it never really got
released.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so people have always felt like there
was this mystique around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen you talk about it online and I
think you said like, oh, people might not
[SPEAKER_04]: like it as much as the other lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you describe it and how come it
never really made it to market in the way
[SPEAKER_04]: the other lines did?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a smaller budded plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of these ones that have,
you know, a little wrap, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little all the way up the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't throw together a cola really at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the buds are kind of this uniform,
but smaller size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not incredibly resonance,
you know, nor particularly, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly potent, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it had this flavor that just crossed
out so fucking good with everything else
[SPEAKER_00]: that I got from the chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was growing out the hybrids
that he had made, you know, when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: working with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew it was an excellent parental
input.
[SPEAKER_00]: And occasionally that thing will throw out
some of that roadkill skunk, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that super, super skunky stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and it jibes that it's not
incredibly potent or resonance,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's about a valuable plant to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked that plant when it's on
and, you know, hybridize it, it crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: out real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did an open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I was going to get them out
there and, and I got super busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really a sad story, but I'm going
to tell it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I did this open pollination
until, until the, actually, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think CBF was maybe with me that year
because my friend CBF online, he,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know him in person and he's a good
friend and he came out and spent a summer
[SPEAKER_00]: with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so anyway, I had this, that Northern
Indian indica or greenhouse filled with a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred plus plants and did this open
pollination and dried, dried the seed and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just got, you know, I got super busy
with harvesting other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just chucked it in a, in a contractor
bag, you know, you know, a big,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, black garbage bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I threw it in the shed,
you know, it was dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of put it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll deal with this later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I kind of forgot about it in the
middle of harvest, you know, in the midst
[SPEAKER_00]: of harvest and the chaos and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I, when I did go check it out,
uh, mice had gotten into this fucking bag
[SPEAKER_00]: and they just ripped through this and they
ate every fucking seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and they, and they left a bunch
of my shit in its, in its path,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so my buds were, were all shred,
you know, just turned to powder and just a
[SPEAKER_00]: pile of my shit kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they ate through the plant and ate up
all of my, my precious seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I still have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I could just do another open
pollination and I just saw the chemists
[SPEAKER_00]: the other day and let them know I'm going
to be raiding the stash and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he's not, cause he's not growing
anymore, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, but it was, it was brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just spent, you know, months and months
and months on this open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chucked it in this fucking old shack
and, uh, the mice had got into it and
[SPEAKER_00]: just, and went for the seed straight for
the seed, you know, and just ate very
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking efficiently, every fucking seed in
this whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this is in a, you know,
several pounds of weed, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably 10 pounds of 10 pounds of seeded
weed or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is, this was a lot of
seeded weed, you know, over a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in a, in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, but yeah, so they went through a
lot and they didn't miss any of them seed
[SPEAKER_00]: either, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through that stuff, hoping that I'd
find at least something, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the shake that these mice had
turned all this seeded bud into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was nothing but my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a real drag, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's absolutely heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can only imagine how efficiently
they went through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's why it never got released
because like that's what happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when I had that in mind and so
it just got eaten and it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: eh, you know, I, you know, I'll still do
it for myself, but it's not really high
[SPEAKER_00]: priority to like do it and get it all out
there and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: People probably won't like it anyway,
you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm interested to know your
thoughts on why we don't see Indian more
[SPEAKER_04]: prevalent among users.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it just does relate to the
yield thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, uh, you know, I think India
has certainly done its fair share of
[SPEAKER_00]: passing some really good grass around the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere from, you know, probably
Columbia, Jamaica, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that it is probably all
crap right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm hesitating to say,
but that's, that's kind of what I suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, same, you could say the same
thing about tie, you know, all of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these honey pots scattered around
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has another factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're involved and that's like,
you know, by time, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't keep something great forever,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if there was a bunch of great
stuff in, in, in India right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, we would see great India.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I could say the same thing about
Thailand right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there's just not a lot of
great stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I think you would see all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a believer, but it's hiding in it's
hiding in somebody's attic, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere old seeds that uncle Joe forgot
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can completely understand that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people are hoping we find
some gold from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be interested to know your thought
because you have grown out a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: Indian and a bunch of haze.
[SPEAKER_04]: In your experience, do you see any Indian
in the positronics haze, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I probably wouldn't know the
difference between, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a Mexican or an Indian.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I saw it growing, you know,
certainly some of the, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more tropical Mexicans, uh, or,
you know, which I would probably wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know the difference between any of the
inputs of, uh, separate, maybe a Colombian
[SPEAKER_00]: that was purpling up, you know,
of any of the inputs, but I, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: doubt that, you know, uh, I don't doubt
that the, that the Southern India,
[SPEAKER_00]: mind you, it's not just Indian,
it's South India, you know, and it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that's pretty goddamn specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the description that,
that, that I was, uh, looking at at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and we've seen Rob Clark write it
and he's a damn good friend with Sam,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't have any reason to doubt
that it's exactly what they say it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could, you could chase the lineage
back to and say that it originally was a
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian, you know, uh, they may have
been selling it already as haze by then
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but I, but I, I allow for all of
it, you know, the, the, uh, description of
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the four way hybrid didn't,
didn't come out of thin air, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and when guys like Rob Clark have written
it and other people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: who I think were probably around back
then, I would call that haze too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly one of the hazes that was
known to Amsterdam and Holland,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at the time, uh, there's just,
there's too many descriptions from back
[SPEAKER_00]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was there, you know, to, uh,
to change it now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're on the topic though,
I wanted to touch on, are there any other
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of underrated land race or genetic
hotspots in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess to me, India is sort of one
that comes to mind that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't hear about it quite as much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any others in your mind that you
think are a bit like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, certainly Southeast Asia,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's probably the biggest one in
our life, you know, that cranked out more
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, I think than any other place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when you talk about India,
uh, boy, that's, it's going back hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: and hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That place has been, you know,
putting out quality, but I don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see it probably doing it,
you know, too much today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I would call hot today
as far as land race varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, that's a real tough
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I would say Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's still probably some,
you know, even in Thailand and bordering
[SPEAKER_00]: countries and, and neighboring islands,
you know, uh, you know, all through that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that region, um, that's still holding
gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there might be some good shit in
Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have smoked some of your fair
share of some good tie bud too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's, I know that's true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe, uh, at the time, yeah,
Australia was privy to some nice import
[SPEAKER_04]: from Thailand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very jealous of all those who got to
try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't get it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we don't either.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately not.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any spots that you think like
really don't get enough attention for what
[SPEAKER_04]: they merit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like for me, I always think like Korea
never really gets discussed much,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I hear from some old timers that like
land race Korean was really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything like that for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown a Northern Korean, uh,
broadly here that was going around the
[SPEAKER_00]: neighborhood, uh, back in the mid eighties
or so, you know, late eighties or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it was, uh, it was a very unique
and, and flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, I don't even remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just remember it really stood out in
flavor, but you know, it didn't come,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't as good as a deep chong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't my favorite, but it was super
interesting, you know, weird spicy
[SPEAKER_00]: incensey kind of evil, uh, thing going on
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably would have been a great thing
to have today for, uh, for working in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Highbridge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I saved the best for last for this
reason.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little bit about how you came to
acquire the deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the memorable stories I've
read online, though I have some suspicions
[SPEAKER_04]: about its authenticity is that,
uh, the seeds came out of a brick of hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: How did it actually go down?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was, it was, uh, it was in a pound
of seeded weed that sold for like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, told for like $5,000 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: When, when, when, when pounds were 1800,
um, it was, it was one that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: these growers accidentally seeded their
crop, but it was so early and everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: was just getting exposed to, to,
uh, uh, um, to broadleaf up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they were all growing early
Mexicans up here before, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the broadly before the Afghan and
everything else started coming through
[SPEAKER_00]: when everybody started rolling in here up
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, and so, yeah, it was a pound of,
it was a pound of seeded weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy actually very entrepreneurial.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seeded his crop instead of saying,
oh, fuck, you know, he went and sold the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeded weed for like way more than he
could have got for, for seedless weed at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and somebody, and it was super unique,
you know, and it was, and it was like new
[SPEAKER_00]: and exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, and somebody up here bought a
pound of, uh, of seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that Afghan for $5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and that's how it got introduced
to the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, uh, floated around in a few
people's hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, back then I got ahold of it and I just
held on tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of, you know, most people have
lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a couple of people that
still have it from the old days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what was your thoughts when you first
grew it out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Were you like, wow, this is something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really, it really stood out,
you know, to, to pretty much everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that sees it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, what the fuck is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it's so, it's like
cartoon-like and it's, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: Jurassic-ness.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like, looks like something out of
a, from a different world, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It truly is something very unique.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think another one of the famous sort of
anecdotes that goes around online is that
[SPEAKER_04]: some people have noticed that there's a
slightly thinner leafed fino that sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: pops its head up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it tends to be a very, a slightly more
cerebral sort of high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you ever experienced that?
[SPEAKER_04]: The thin leaf deep chunk?
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously it's still not thin by like
equatorial standards, but the thinner leaf
[SPEAKER_04]: deep chunk fino?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've always kept an eye on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked those because I think that they
have, they have more room for cranking out
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've come across a lot of really,
really, really good ones like that in my
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, you know, narrow relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say it might correlate with a,
you know, a higher callus to leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they're, I think they're worth
keeping an eye on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to grow a bunch of leafy
fucking bullshit, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to grow the best resin that I
can with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that come out the best
flower, you know, are often a thinner
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And have you ever had any ideas or
thoughts about where the deep chunk comes
[SPEAKER_04]: from, like specifically?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, you know, in Afghanistan,
I know that there was a million of them
[SPEAKER_00]: around here, you know, at the time,
but it was one of the more extreme ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I, and I thought it,
I found it really cerebral too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kept it and pretty consistent,
you know, I mean, and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could, like I said before earlier,
it could do really well in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those fucking leaves are great
solar panels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, out of Creole, curiosity,
were there ever any other things that went
[SPEAKER_04]: around back in the day, like sort of
around that time that were maybe unique in
[SPEAKER_04]: a sense or memorable for some reason?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hundreds, hundreds, you know, so it's,
it's hard to even talk about them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but except to say that I cry myself to
sleep at night for, you know, fucking up
[SPEAKER_00]: and not keeping more of it, you know,
even though it wasn't my favorite,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm, but I'm happy that I've kept my,
you know, what was my favorite,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of feel like, you know,
I'm off the hook.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give you the all clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're very grateful for what you've given
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, while we're on the topic,
we had a gypsy Nirvana on not long ago and
[SPEAKER_04]: he, he told me that you had this
interesting story about like winning the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis cut with deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just remember that, you know,
he was the first guy that kind of jumped
[SPEAKER_00]: away from, you know, the politics of the,
you know, the whole politics of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, cannabis cup there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the high times one,
uh, people were paying the pain to enter,
[SPEAKER_00]: paying to win.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was kind of a, kind of a shifty
scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he, he, and he just, you know,
he wanted to, you know, make it more of a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, anybody can, anybody can come
over here and, and, and enter the contest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I sent him a couple of
ounces and, um, and I've won the fucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they probably never had anything
even similar remotely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there was, you know, I mean,
I think, I think there was already diesel
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff by the time, by that time at,
you know, available, I think it was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I think it was Oh four or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was some, there was
probably some good smoke there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I had just done an outdoor grow of
like 50 plants and I had a couple of ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was keeping an eye on, you know,
because they were like fucking resin bombs
[SPEAKER_00]: halfway through flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I, you know, I had a few of
them tagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was keeping an eye on and I grabbed the
best two of 50 and sent them in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some nice ones by the sounds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, apparently so.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were my favorites twice and sent them
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and it hurts a little
because, you know, those are the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want all of that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I got to send this guy an ouch,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did and I don't regret it,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: He, uh, he spoke pretty fondly of his
recollections of you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said that like, uh, initially
before he was like stocking your seeds,
[SPEAKER_04]: you, you were just sending them to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_04]: That sounds very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I mean, that's,
it's kind of been what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, um, I don't, uh,
I didn't, I didn't want to handle,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really didn't want to handle all
the PMs and all that stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I figured I'd just give him the gypsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can book and give him out because he
was doing freebies at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm like, okay, well,
you know, he can do something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way this is the, this dude has to
go to the post office and not me,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the way to make it easier to,
you know, to have done what I wanted to do
[SPEAKER_00]: without actually having to do it myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you have it gang.
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you think?
