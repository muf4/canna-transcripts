[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hello again, my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fancy seeing you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the next episode of the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Cannabis Podcast for Buddy
Enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: On this episode, we're joined by our
Alaskan friend, the one and only AK
[SPEAKER_01]: Beanbrains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking all things genetics, new school,
old school, and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode, as always, was brought to
you by the one and only Seeds Here Now,
[SPEAKER_01]: your only seed bank that offers a
guarantee both on satisfaction and
[SPEAKER_01]: germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to shop elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got all the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Likewise, 420 Australia and Organic
Gardening Solutions, your two number ones
[SPEAKER_01]: in Australia holding down the fort,
everything from apparel to grow needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it there first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a quick shout out to our regenerative
farming friends at Dragonfly Earth
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big thank you and welcome to our
first guest from the final frontier.
[SPEAKER_01]: An extremely nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the pleasure of hanging out with
a few times now.
[SPEAKER_01]: AK Beanbrains, thanks so much for taking
the time to join us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to finally do this, like you
said, after we've met a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should have already been, you know,
fishing or something, but the interviews
[SPEAKER_02]: passed due, so I'm glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to have you on, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first question for today, what are you
currently smoking on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny thing is, it's the same thing that,
you know, I had a lot of at the Emerald
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember what we were smoking that
Platinum Huckleberry Cookie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you happen to remember that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do fondly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good, because, but yeah, I happen to
have a little bit of that, and I'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: picking that as a really good favour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love Dynasty, so his smoke just stands
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah, I can definitely agree with you
on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's loop back to that one a bit later,
because the first thing I wanted to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: you is what was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was a bad kid, so about fifth
grade, when, you know, all the kids are
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to score cigarettes and stuff,
a friend of mine's dad had a little,
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't convenience store, it was like a
country store, and he lifted like cartons
[SPEAKER_02]: of, the worst thing in the world was,
I think, camels or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was horrible, strong tobacco,
and we'd get it together after school and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, smoke a couple, but it turned me
green.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they tended to keep smoking,
and I found out that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: pot at the time was like real weedy and
just around, I think it was probably right
[SPEAKER_02]: about 80, a little bit earlier than 80,
78, but you know, my mom had a friend,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he'd give me ounces or not,
you know, they called it lids at the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was five to 10 bucks a lid,
and I'd have him, he'd get me to roll and
[SPEAKER_02]: clean it up and roll like, you know,
35, 40 doobies out of a lid, he'd give me
[SPEAKER_02]: a one or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I smoked that, and it was just such
swaggy weed, I never ever really got high,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I thought I was getting high,
just like a real poor butt every time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I guess I was around 12 years old,
and I babysat for a friend, my mom's
[SPEAKER_02]: friends, and I don't want to be
stereotypical, but they were bikers,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they had some bud, they knew that I'd
already smoked, and they said it would be
[SPEAKER_02]: cool to try it, and they gave me a bud,
and it was chocolate tie for all I can
[SPEAKER_02]: tell from everything I've ever seen later
in my life, it was real chocolate tie,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was all basically right off the tie
stick, and I pulled the seeds out of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I smoked it, but it's stuff,
that hit me, and I was like euphorically
[SPEAKER_02]: high for four or five hours, shouldn't
have been babysitting their kids,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it was like super potent,
so then I realized that what pot really
[SPEAKER_02]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, wow, and has that always left that
as kind of having a little fond spot in
[SPEAKER_01]: your heart?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to ever go back to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It really does, because it's a rarity
though, chocolate tie, and that certain
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor that was on that, it was a
leathery, tobacco-y, chocolate-y flavor,
[SPEAKER_02]: and if I could have just had the knowledge
or any kind of sense to keep those seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, it's insane how many pounds of seeds
have gone down into the waste,
[SPEAKER_02]: because at the time, all the import was
just seed bud, and we never thought we
[SPEAKER_02]: would want the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely, and I mean, just as a
little random side question, do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's true that there ever was tie coming
in that had been altered with opium or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You always hear the whispers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that economically it would be
viable for them to do that, but I do
[SPEAKER_02]: believe it had to have happened,
because it was talked about, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe there was opium dusted.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said opium dipped, who knows what
they call it, but it was basically a very
[SPEAKER_02]: potent psychoactive product, so I never
really got my hands on it, but I know
[SPEAKER_02]: people that they swear that it was
certainly the real deal, and it came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard an anecdotal story from a
friend who said that one of the only times
[SPEAKER_01]: he'd ever greened out was from tie stick,
and to me, that always gave a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of credence to the idea, because a lot of
people, when they first have opioids,
[SPEAKER_01]: they vomit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll take over your whole system,
so you're not ready to be hit by a truck,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's what hits you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so with all that being said,
have you ever looked at some of the kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of notable tie hybrids and thought,
oh, I want to get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, maybe Hayes,
given it was like 50% tie at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's always been a big challenge up
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: For outdoor growing is really a challenge
up here, so our summers are harsh and
[SPEAKER_02]: short, so if you're going to do light
depth in greenhouse, you have to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: program for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just devoted to it for Colombians,
their ties, so it's not an impossible
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, but that's one of the things I put
off the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've hardly ever grown a very,
very little Hayes due to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to grow it up here, but I've
always been super fond of that and want to
[SPEAKER_02]: relive it, and I've smoked Bodhi's really
good 16-week tie at Emerald, and it's got
[SPEAKER_02]: a really similar high, but it wasn't that
exact same thing that I'd smoked before,
[SPEAKER_02]: so yeah, I'd always like to relive that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know the tie you were talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that pearl tie with the alternating
calyxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was kind of yellowish and brown,
not yellowish, but amberish, I should say,
[SPEAKER_02]: and brown, and it was just hemp strings
tied onto a bamboo splint is what it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: so they tore it off for me and actually
gave it to me, and I broke it up,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it had qualities and tastes that just,
I don't know, that will ever be found,
[SPEAKER_02]: so yeah, I'm chasing that rabbit for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it definitely sounds very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take it back though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start off at that point where you
tried the tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: From that point onwards, what made you or
were the factors that led to you then
[SPEAKER_01]: deciding to grow yourself, and how long
did it take before you did do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It took me a little while, about three
years before I realized that you could
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, there wasn't a ton of
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably accidentally sprouted a seed
and went from there, but at the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: after 75, here in Alaska, there was a
Supreme Court decision with the state of
[SPEAKER_02]: Alaska Supreme Court, and it was called
the Raven decision, and it legalized
[SPEAKER_02]: personal use cannabis here, so there was a
lot of ornamental, kind of like shrubbery
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds being thrown out, and you could see
people growing leaf type of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They never flower, because they're summer,
so about 21, 22 hours, and sunlight is
[SPEAKER_02]: blaring, and then it'll shut off to
nothing and freeze, so the plants will
[SPEAKER_02]: just start to sex, and maybe three weeks
in the flower, they'll just freeze up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be solid winter from then.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was always thinking about growing,
and it took me about three years before I
[SPEAKER_02]: realized it was just something easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay, and so a lot of people outside
the states may not be aware that Alaska
[SPEAKER_01]: legalized or decriminalized growing very
early on compared to, say, California,
[SPEAKER_01]: and commonly I get it here told in the
context of, yeah, they were almost trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to invite people up there, you know,
get the population boosted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that the reason behind it,
and did it work?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was kind of like opened up to
be a free state and just, it wasn't like a
[SPEAKER_02]: move that a lot of people would have took
up, I don't think, but it was viewed as
[SPEAKER_02]: more of a freedom type of a state,
and what happened with the Supreme Court
[SPEAKER_02]: ruling is it said that the right to
privacy was stronger than the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana was illegal, so you could have
four ounces in your house and up to 16
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, so it was just like so calm,
and when you're having the mindset of it
[SPEAKER_02]: being legal, they did have illegalities on
it, which was transportation and selling
[SPEAKER_02]: of it, but you could gift it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't ever transport it,
so you know, they'd get you on that,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was really silly, but it was so
commonplace to just grow that nobody,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a paranoia for sure because
there was, there was federal rules that
[SPEAKER_02]: came into play after 24 plants you would
be into, like federal felony land,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you just didn't want to go there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was your first setup like back
then when you first started?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, outdoor sun, and I knew about light
depth at the time, so you try to just get
[SPEAKER_02]: it in in September and start covering it
up for three weeks advanced before the
[SPEAKER_02]: weather really turns on you, and
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't, we had crappy lights,
and certainly highlights had just come
[SPEAKER_02]: out, but I didn't have a penny for them,
so I used the eight foot high output
[SPEAKER_02]: fluorescent lights, which is pretty common
grow light back then, and super
[SPEAKER_02]: inefficient, and you'd get real stretchy
plants, and besides the genetics were,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I tried to grow Colombian inside
and end up being 12 feet tall,
[SPEAKER_02]: sideways, and I realized real quickly that
we had to have something better going on
[SPEAKER_02]: than that, so I learned very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what type of genetics did you look to
that would be more well suited to the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was plenty of, you know,
by mid-80s there was plenty of indica that
[SPEAKER_02]: was going around, so up here especially,
there's always been a ton of local indicas
[SPEAKER_02]: that were never named, and if you were
gonna grow indoor in a light depth,
[SPEAKER_02]: you would get something like the Northern
Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern Lights number one was super
common from about 80 to 85, and there was
[SPEAKER_02]: others that weren't named, but they were
just about the same, three foot to four
[SPEAKER_02]: foot tall, maximum bushy Christmas tree
shaped, solids, really solid could support
[SPEAKER_02]: them, you know, they'd support their bud,
which was heavy, and it'd always be mold
[SPEAKER_02]: resistant, and tended to be just pretty
good straight up easy to grow indoors,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's what we kind of aim for pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: This might be a silly question to some
people, but I've always wondered,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, given the name Northern Lights,
do you think that there was some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding effort put into the actual
Northern Lights up around the Alaska slash
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian area, or do you think it was
purely just a marketing name?
[SPEAKER_02]: It had to have been a marketing name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was developed in the Northwest
in the Seattle area much more so than it
[SPEAKER_02]: was ever past British Columbia,
so I don't think it was up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It only made its way up here, but by the
time I saw it, it was a mainstay,
[SPEAKER_02]: so the name stuck, and really,
really probably one of the best things
[SPEAKER_02]: that ever happened to the cannabis that
we've come across so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's fast forward a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you decide to have a whack at
breeding yourself, and what was the first
[SPEAKER_01]: thing you ever made?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it an accident, or was it purposeful?
[SPEAKER_02]: The first time I ever tried to breed now
would probably have been about 18 or 19.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought it was a way to advance any
way to get genetics, because there just
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't seed stock available, so I would
take whatever so-and-so's aphi from,
[SPEAKER_02]: usually it was like trailer park genetics,
and I would cross it over to whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: other one might have, you know,
red petioles stem, and I would just try to
[SPEAKER_02]: make crosses just by cool looks and smells
right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was kind of like my goal,
try to breed the best of the best of
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever we could find and give it a test
run that next batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was the consumer market like at
the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, did you do it because you knew that
it would be unique, people would want to
[SPEAKER_01]: try it, or there wasn't that much push
from consumers to say develop new things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Up here, there was no market such like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody grew their own smoke,
or you would bomb it off of somebody that
[SPEAKER_02]: happened to have plenty excess of smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was pretty clandestine gardens,
but everybody knew each other and they
[SPEAKER_02]: knew where there was supply of bud around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even remember even selling any bud
until like the late 80s, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty unique to where we were just
growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the scene sounds like it was kind
of focused around the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were the things people were most
interested in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it like as a grower, were people just
interested in the biggest yielding or was
[SPEAKER_01]: it more a quality focus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was definitely, I'd say a lot of
it had to have been with yield because
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody, shit, there was a lot of,
still a lot of people not having nice big
[SPEAKER_02]: grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of basements that were dug
out, you know, when they're growing under
[SPEAKER_02]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rafters and you might get a five foot
ceiling out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people were growing good stocky ass
plants and try to get good yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that we ever,
never ever gave up, but had just quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think nobody ever looked any other
direction, but quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like the dream almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy because people did focus their
own goals for their own purposes and
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody basically wanted to make
themselves happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before all the competitive brand naming
and so-and-so's bud is better than
[SPEAKER_02]: so-and-so, it was like a cooperative thing
and people were really just trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: extend the good feeling of the seventies
kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so were there any breeders at that
time who you were kind of looking up to or
[SPEAKER_01]: you were inspired by or was it still a bit
too early for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Still a little bit early for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no advertised breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: The very first that I had ever heard of
was Navelle Schoenmacher over in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_02]: in 88.
[SPEAKER_02]: It opened up, you know, a whole new world
when I realized that there was genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: that could be just picked up from a
collector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a question I love to ask
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you hold Navelle in the hierarchy
of breeders throughout history?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is he numero uno for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd say yes, because when we
were first involved with him, my partner,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's one of the best guys in the world
and I don't deal with him and haven't for
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 years or better, he would hand write
letters to Navelle and it might be a two,
[SPEAKER_02]: three month process to get a return reply,
but he was steering us and telling us and
[SPEAKER_02]: he's like such a great mentor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in that aspect, he didn't just
collect and breed, but he wanted to spread
[SPEAKER_02]: the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that little bit of Aussie pride in
that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so something I wanted to touch on
quickly was when I spoke to him in person,
[SPEAKER_01]: you mentioned this idea of like up in
Alaska, you guys were very isolated and
[SPEAKER_01]: you kind of were OK with that in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you mind expanding a little more on
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: We were, you know, isolated in quite a bit
of ways to where we didn't get imports.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they did make it up here,
I would say it'd be a 10 year hiatus and
[SPEAKER_02]: it might have made itself all the way
around the world before it actually hit to
[SPEAKER_02]: Alaska or the local region and outlying
towns.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was well proven by the time it got here
or it would have just faded out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you think about our our isolation,
it made us a lot better growers because it
[SPEAKER_02]: would be like there's still things that
were developed up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple named things that are just like
legends and still up here and the same old
[SPEAKER_02]: heads have got them and still don't
generally put it out or even care to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's amazing that the mentality is
still nearly the same for 30 and 40 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people have kind of kept the same
mindset.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a unique thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you think that's still the case?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the hype strains make it up there or
is there still that time lag?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, now is like you and I are,
you know, different sides of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's technology is just here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I had a couple of years ago
taken live cuts to Emerald and was
[SPEAKER_02]: actually stopped by the TSA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are flagged, I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our airport police wanted to
interview me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got down to where they when they
wanted to know how much flour I had and
[SPEAKER_02]: how much concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they wanted to know the weight of
all the hundred seed packs I carried.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had come up with the right answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he asked me where my medical
grow permit was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I told him was supposed to stay in the
groin and I was supposed to copy it or
[SPEAKER_02]: it's in invalid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything just was the right answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was under the weight limit for
carrying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he just says, OK, well,
what about the live cannabis plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, as far as I'm concerned,
the law says you can carry six plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: the TSA says whatever the state legal
limit is, is what you can carry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he, you know, he ran me for priors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no priors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, OK, well, if this is all
the medication you need, then we'll have
[SPEAKER_02]: a, you know, have a good trip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just like let us straight go on our
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point, and just like you can go to
Emerald if you're brave enough to buy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, clones that are available down
there, you can just straight pick up any
[SPEAKER_02]: strain and bring it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hype strain or maybe heirloom or.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then clone shipping is not a big thing
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tends to be that anybody that has
access to good genetics, you can just get
[SPEAKER_02]: it shipped straight to you and now the
door is wide open for genetics up here
[SPEAKER_02]: every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's 20 new strains coming up
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting you mention that,
because I'm not sure if it was you I was
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to about this or someone else,
but they said there was a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: finnickiness with the clone shipping
compared to, say, other states in that,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, you sent it on the Friday and it was
going to sit somewhere over the weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only is that, you know, not ideal for
the clone, but given if it was winter
[SPEAKER_01]: time, it could potentially kill the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a bit of an overstated fact or is
that very much the reality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty common that you could run into
small glitches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had, you know, half a dozen or more
packages that would maybe hit during the
[SPEAKER_02]: California two or three years in a row,
man, they were hit with the fires.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they were hit with drought and flood
and they'd shut down county roads and
[SPEAKER_02]: certain outlying towns.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might not get a three day priority
package.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could.
[SPEAKER_02]: Generally send a clone three days safely
in a clone porter or clone shipper and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the seventh day, they don't like to
be in the dark that long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had I've had them just one after
the other going to even like Bob Hemphill
[SPEAKER_02]: and the nature farm and they'd get them
and they'd be just seven days.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd be yellow as hell and droopy and
ready just to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: No way you're going to not going to talk
them back into life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the summertime, I think it's
better to ship in the cool season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Truly, we don't have bad luck in the cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the summertime, it tends to sweat the
plants a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're going to send them dry tech,
just snips or fresh cut tips, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the dry tech, it works to a certain
degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they start to sweat, it'll just
cook the foliage and it'll be wilted
[SPEAKER_02]: lettuce or worse every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it brings its own challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned a minute ago that some
really old school, really awesome strains
[SPEAKER_01]: were developed up in Alaska and they're
still being held by the locals up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brings us to the question that everyone
knew was coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the story behind Alaskan
Thunderfuck or Matanuska Thunderfuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we know that was coming,
but there's a lot of stories behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the experience that I've had with it
was the 1970s and the mid 70s,
[SPEAKER_02]: quite a few Northern California,
Emerald Triangle people, whether they were
[SPEAKER_02]: coming back from Vietnam at that exact
point or didn't at the end of the war,
[SPEAKER_02]: about 74, they didn't want to go into that
conflict.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of them went to Canada and some of
them ditched out and came up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's I'm not going to say there's
a bunch of draft dodgers that just that
[SPEAKER_02]: fill our state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a lot of people that were,
you know, patriotic minded, but didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to go and fight for some political
cause that had no no win to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they they uprooted and they came up
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they brought was some some bud
that was, you know, it could have been
[SPEAKER_02]: originally Burmese or crosses of their
import bud that they were growing down in
[SPEAKER_02]: Trinity and humbled.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it didn't work up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So within, I'd say, four or five years,
there was no more of that tall structural
[SPEAKER_02]: equatorial, I'd say lowland type of
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was they would basically
outcross it to the best, fastest,
[SPEAKER_02]: shortest, most controllable grow plant
there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the sativa genetics went out
with it by 1980.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was there was hardly any of it to be
found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's the plant like itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it is it more of a stocky one,
as you just implied?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the kind of the flavor and the
highlight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our stands as we have a very old cutting
that I started my job currently right now
[SPEAKER_02]: in 87.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my foreman at the time is where I got
this and he had it at the time growing in
[SPEAKER_02]: a quantset.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it puts it at over 33, 34 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant the plant as it stands,
these guys never cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a cutting and it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hadn't been taken bottom cuts for
decades on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it started getting a lot of
generational drift and getting really
[SPEAKER_02]: sluggish and woodier and woodier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they didn't have any common sense to
like regenerate that plant in the sun or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, try to advance the upper growth
and take cuts and get better, healthier
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So about a long time they grew it like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, you know, it's an indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at once it are not an indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows like it like an aphi type of
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll get real thick, solid base that
could go to two and three inches even
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets this monster base on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It supports great, great amount of bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, super crystalline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it smells like sweet wine and sweet
chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a crazy combination because
it's like sangria wine and Hershey's
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolate bars with the turps are on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it tastes like that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a real unique plant, but I've
delving into it now by making back crosses
[SPEAKER_02]: of itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I dug into it and we're finding that
the sativa hybrids are still in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just it laid dormant in there and nobody
really wanted to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's a point to where I'd sent it
to, you know, a couple of guys to play
[SPEAKER_02]: with like a dead pan head and two-tone
Willie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they came out with a lot more hybrid
types, not as much as the standing aphi
[SPEAKER_02]: that she is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I have to, I've come up with
really, really cool hybrids that,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've even pulled pure skunk out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've collected a male that's just the
heaviest pure skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's crazy to think what could really
be dug up out of the Matt Houston.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess kind of the last question on
this one is, do you think that it was kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of developed in like a communal sense,
kind of in the way that like skunk was
[SPEAKER_01]: initially developed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you had to take a guess,
what do you think are some of the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you mentioned the Burmese and the
aphi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just equate it to being pure
Trinity County and Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flavors are right there real,
real close.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I used to, let's say 1980,
you know, Humboldt, we would just get Bud
[SPEAKER_02]: called Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just a really killer,
sweet aphi is basically what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'd get some interesting turps every
which way, but it wasn't super skunky or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like great, great flower,
like the, like the best cushions that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can get now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's half of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there has to be some tie in there
in Burmese because what's coming out of it
[SPEAKER_02]: now is pretty uniquely different than the
way she stands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if we jump to another kind of older
strain that I know you've got in the
[SPEAKER_01]: collection, tell us a little bit about
your cat piss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't aware that you actually had that
one, but I am aware that they tend to,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of them basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your cat piss probably isn't the same as
someone else's.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you mind giving us a bit of
backstory on your one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the cat piss just came our way from
imported puna bud that came shrink wrap
[SPEAKER_02]: from probably the very first seal a meal
in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right around 85, we were getting just some
import bud from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of all things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it was some of the best flower
that we've ever smoked to real comparable
[SPEAKER_02]: to, I would say the, uh, what we would
call humbled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just a fantastic, uh, Indica
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a cush.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but it had the craziest turps to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just bred it to Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, for years we had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is still a super unique type of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, it for whatever reason grows
much more sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: She'll have a very long middle finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about one third longer or two up to
twice as long as all the other fears in
[SPEAKER_02]: the pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it'll grow into this,
uh, crazy sativa looking bush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I've got it in a probably F.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two F three and then BXs and BX two,
three and four.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I recently, you know, out crossed it
to a really rank, uh, cat piss that came
[SPEAKER_02]: from California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have a gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he has, uh, uh, haze that was total
cat piss, uh, Indica haze that,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, is just about, it'll make your eyes
water when you're dealing with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're, uh, in the flower form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's really pungent, ammoniated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ours is slightly sweeter, but super
ammoniated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we couldn't help, but, you know,
put it together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I think there needs to be a lot
more of the old fashioned, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: combinations of that terpene being brought
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Hawaiian did have real unique thin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaves the leaf isn't thick like it's like
a Indica leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much thinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and, uh, it's a lighter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Green by far than most any Indica,
but, uh, the bud that we did get for
[SPEAKER_02]: certain was a really good Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what they called it too,
was Hawaiian Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always just called it the Hawaiian
Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, as I'm getting to do a lot more
digging into it, I'm coming up with a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more Sativa hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick shout out to El Jefe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I wanted to ask you though,
was that, you know, this, this idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: having these clones for a while is pretty
common within your collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you keep these clones for so long?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it seems so common for people to
just lose clones over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've got like 30 plus year old
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to, uh, farm, you keep,
you keep about five, uh, plants with your
[SPEAKER_02]: trusted group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully, uh, everybody can cover
each other's bases because certainly we've
[SPEAKER_02]: all, we've all had situations where we've
lost our mothers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, my biggest advantage to saving
genetics was not necessarily, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping a clone alive the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of old, old, old pettings,
but I've got a lot of old, old,
[SPEAKER_02]: old seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would produce it in the late eighties
and early nineties, and I would just
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can go back on it, you know,
at any point in time and generally have a
[SPEAKER_02]: very high success rate just to reproduce
what we were dealing with 30, 30 plus
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the topic of 30 plus years ago,
let's talk about that epic old school
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Lights freezer beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've got a few different freezer
beans, but fill me on on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I believe your one was different to
the one Coastal worked with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's the same too.
[SPEAKER_02]: What mine is, is, uh, 85, just the
standby, uh, typical Northern Lights one
[SPEAKER_02]: that was going around and it was,
uh, just fantastic in every way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that I still think if it
came out today, it would just beat the
[SPEAKER_02]: shit out of cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody would just go, wow, such a
complex, uh, old school high to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the flavors and, uh, the look and
bag of peel covers anything that the
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies and all of the thousand cookies
crosses are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I had the 85 cut and then in 89 we
purchased the, uh, skunk, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry, the NL one from, uh, from Sensi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was one of our four picks that year
in 89.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a three times inbred.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where his was, uh, you know,
back crossed to be extremely fast,
[SPEAKER_02]: 45 days, super stout, super resistant to,
uh, molds and, uh, almost a bulletproof
[SPEAKER_02]: type of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I crossed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Male to my female cutting and we just had
seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the, you know, I'd grow out the
seeds for sure, but I crossed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd put them up to F2 and F3 and then I'd
frozen a ton of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, when I think that, uh,
coastal Kagu's, um, and it one is the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking it's the exact same 85 cut
that I had, but, uh, different phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: His has a lot of the turp, turpinoline
and, uh, spray paint phenols, but it still
[SPEAKER_02]: has the same, uh, everything on it is
identical, the resin, the look,
[SPEAKER_02]: the structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's, uh, it's a real unique type of
plant that it's so strong and dominant
[SPEAKER_02]: that, uh, the single stemmed capabilities
can override everything that I've read it
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that I've ever seen anything
ever be able to override the, the NL one
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says something for dominance and line
breeding, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a question related to this,
I wanted to ask is when you were doing
[SPEAKER_01]: these early seed increases or back crosses
F2s, et cetera, did you do kind of more
[SPEAKER_01]: open pollination types of things,
or are you just selecting one male kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: how more modern genetics has done?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've always open pollinated if we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if there's only one male,
you know, if you end up with one male and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to reproduce anything,
you're going to use that male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been at that point, but every time
that I can open it up, I won't open it up
[SPEAKER_02]: and use the weak genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be a couple of real shitty
males that just maybe they might not even
[SPEAKER_02]: be genetically inferior.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might've been that they were lagging
because they cracked later or they got
[SPEAKER_02]: more shade or, but I generally would take
like the top five to seven, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: males every single time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also looking for, you know,
a lot of high qualities, lots of different
[SPEAKER_02]: qualities in the males, but opening up a
population is a lot better to me than to,
[SPEAKER_02]: to ice isolating it with one super male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you remember the types of things
you were selecting for back then?
[SPEAKER_01]: And can you contrast that for us in terms
of what are the traits you like to select
[SPEAKER_01]: for in your mail nowadays?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, uh, we were pretty idiot,
idiotic, I should say on our selections on
[SPEAKER_02]: our, uh, in the 89, 90 years, because I
didn't know and realize the dominance in
[SPEAKER_02]: the hemp flower, everything that we're
basically dealing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going back, you know,
10,000 years, it's going to come down
[SPEAKER_02]: from, uh, a fiber wild, uh, strain of,
of, uh, flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I realized and learned a whole
lot in the first couple of years,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause we would pick a super male.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what we call a super male,
the male that wants to dominate over
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll just be.
[SPEAKER_02]: A foot taller.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be about a week faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in some cases, twice as tall and three
weeks faster than other males.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would think that male would just be
the tits and we would grab it and breed
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I realized after three
generations, four generations of doing
[SPEAKER_02]: that, we had actually degraded the flower
to becoming so dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's you get long internodals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, stretch, uh, it just basically was
just reverting back to hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the fourth generation of picking a
super male like that, it basically,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can turn a plant's genetics
faster than anybody thinks you can and
[SPEAKER_02]: send seven generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make a plant just, just be
whatever you want it to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's really what we've come up
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's commonly held view that, you know,
if humans were to disappear off the planet
[SPEAKER_01]: and we left cannabis to do its own thing,
we'd, we'd get back to hemp pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that backs that idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the contrast view, I, uh,
I'm, I've got a lot more insight on what,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, what is what each strain is
going to be a lot, a lot of difference in
[SPEAKER_02]: their values.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, uh, I realized that you want to get
certain males for certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do everything a whole different way
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always just every day seems to be a,
you know, a new chapter in a learning
[SPEAKER_02]: experience, which is one of the things I
really love about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds very humbling, like a lot of
breeders say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get a little bit specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of, uh, attributes or kind of,
um, tests, if you want to call it that,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you do on your males?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you like a stem rub guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: You more of like looking at the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: What things help you identify a quality
male?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know most people are really,
really big on stem rub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my opinion on stem rub is that it's
valuable, but it, uh, it changes and you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you might find a day to day changes in
males.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't go by stem rub.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would just go on, uh, structure,
uh, the health of the plant, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: stem rub.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will generally, uh, breed a plant and
grow it completely out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, instead of making maybe reverse a
male with floral or some other hormonal,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, spray to test, to see what type of,
uh, uh, female type of traits it will
[SPEAKER_02]: throw, like the, uh, what phenol it can
possibly throw for turps and, and the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of crystal and structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one way to check, but I just like
to grow a male out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally they at the six to 10th
week, they're going to go fully ripe on
[SPEAKER_02]: you and, uh, show you exactly what's
available in the mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I probably have five different real big
criteria that, uh, they all go and go into
[SPEAKER_02]: play, but definitely like to see the final
product finished out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard this sentiment echoed by a few
different breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we've only really had two 707
seed bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, gosh, the name is escaping me at
the other breeder who used the floral and
[SPEAKER_01]: reverse them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what you said, my always,
my question, I love to ask in relation to
[SPEAKER_01]: that is, do you find that the terpene
profile you get off that reverse male is
[SPEAKER_01]: quite accurate and indicative of what it
will pass on?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's a good one right there
because you're inducing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you can change, you can change,
uh, vegetables and fruits so much with any
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of, uh, hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really not a super fair test is
why I don't use the, uh, the floral.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just think how much you can change
ripening of any fruit or vegetable with
[SPEAKER_02]: ethylene and, uh, gibberellic acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that's right on the same line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's better to go onto a natural
test than to rely on a hormonal change
[SPEAKER_02]: that you created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on the polar end of the spectrum,
what do you feel is the role of labs
[SPEAKER_01]: within breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like to utilize any of their
services or do you still kind of like to
[SPEAKER_01]: use first principles?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was, uh, I'm a big advocate of,
uh, analytical testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, I think it's, it's very,
very, um, important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's also a lot of times not,
uh, financially viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is, uh, since we are like crazy
addicts, addicted to, uh, producing new
[SPEAKER_02]: strains and wanting to test them out at 80
to $150 per test, which is real cheap
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to what I hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, there's very high testing rates
at other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ours is, is relatively inexpensive,
but when you're doing 10 turp,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 terpene tests or 10, uh, potency and
cannabinoid profiles, it's $1,500 out of
[SPEAKER_02]: your pocket just to get an answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it only makes sense so much,
but, um, I would, if I had unlimited
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of money, I would probably put a
lot of stock into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe a bit of a redundant
question, but have you ever utilized the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole, um, like, you know, finding out the
sex of seedlings when they're still just
[SPEAKER_01]: got their little pedioles or do you just
think like, nah, just go old school.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll show themselves soon enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny because we talk about that
quite a few people are starting to utilize
[SPEAKER_02]: the, uh, the different testing services.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know phylos has it and farmer,
uh, farmer John, I think is one of them or
[SPEAKER_02]: farmer Freeman.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I have never done that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to just grow the male because I,
I consider that there's some, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might only be 5% or something,
but I still want to kind of like roll the
[SPEAKER_02]: dice and see what's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I have done about 80 analytical tests
though on different plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am, like I said, I'm a big,
I'm a big supporter of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just not, uh, financially capable of
constantly testing everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I do narrow something down and I
have to know, we, we test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good sentiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you are testing out some seeds
you've made, how many seeds you'd like to
[SPEAKER_01]: pop to get a good idea of what's going on
within the line?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like what I like and what I can do are
way different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do 300 at like a minimum and
then I get a pretty fair answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, at a minimum 10 and that doesn't give
you a whole lot of answers unless your
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics are like super inbred or if
they're so focused and you know exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: what they are, you can get a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a lot out of a smaller
batches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a bit of a devil's advocate
question, but let's just say you had a
[SPEAKER_01]: strain that you were liking the results in
terms of what you were finding inside of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but you rather consistently found that
you get a hermy every say three packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, one really definitive hermy
every 30 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that like rule it out for you or do
you still think that there's potential?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just maybe warn people that that is a
possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how do you feel about that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a good question because I think
that super worthy genetics would be,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, I don't think that that's
going to be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: One in 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are, uh, if the people that are
getting the genetics from you are wanting
[SPEAKER_02]: it because it's such a good plant,
they are going to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, a bunch of people that
don't really know what they're doing and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, grow kind of improperly or stress
their gardens too much and might have high
[SPEAKER_02]: occurrences of hermies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, I would just talk to them ahead
of time and, uh, which is near impossible
[SPEAKER_02]: if they're buying it out of a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you tell them ahead of time,
what's going on, that's really not a bad
[SPEAKER_02]: number.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the genetics are just mediocre and
you're getting that is totally
[SPEAKER_02]: unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be standout genetics or,
uh, the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that brings us to an interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about strains that have a
little bit of controversy surrounding
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not super familiar because
I'm not a, uh, I'm not the type of guy
[SPEAKER_02]: that follows any drama.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, for a lot of time, I've dealt
only with certain genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't necessarily study or know a
lot of people's creations or what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: famous for or what they hurt somebody
else's butt or, or, um, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't keep up with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I get told this by a couple of very
knowledgeable young people that are like
[SPEAKER_02]: strained fiends and they, they just know
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, uh, I have no problem probably using
somebody's genetics like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I would want to go back to the person
that they doubled crossed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I'd be straight with them first
because I'm not the guy that goes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'll go out of this world with my
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's basically it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to go around being talked
bad about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have no problem work in certain
lines, but, uh, I would avoid it if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just too much controversy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see the value in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, kind of the most high profile
incidents of that is a rez dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you familiar with that case?
[SPEAKER_01]: And would you use rez dogs genetics if you
had something you liked?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a real good question there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am, I'm getting old enough to quit being
so spiteful, but I was for my whole life,
[SPEAKER_02]: the type that would cut off my nose to
spite my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to avoid a lot of situations
and not, uh, not go to that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I knew all about what happened with
rez dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, so that gives me a kind of a
low opinion of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, somebody had sent me a pack of
his, uh, AJ soured these all V three.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I grow this shit out too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, are basically like, uh, they're not
poly poly popoloid, but they, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were like oral violet taxi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, one was a hermy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other two like sucked shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So rez dog can kiss my ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might have to edit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're happy with it, I'm happy with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just kind of came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you that might come out something
like that, but, uh, you know, I got a P I
[SPEAKER_02]: got to hold people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for their standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, if your genetics suck and you're
a piece of crap, then you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's, that's just it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly know that a lot of people,
um, have done good with his, his,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it's a great little segue
onto chem dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, chem dog is a focal part of the
show and indeed modern cannabis history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where does chem dogs sit in the grand
scheme of things to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you have any plans to try to work
with it going forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: That might be the best question that you
ask me because, uh, um, I am, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I recently met, say, you know,
lucky dog, uh, skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've known, I've known, uh,
Duke for a while and, uh, should Duke send
[SPEAKER_02]: me some, uh, Kim cross maybe a couple of
years ago when I grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, I didn't think too much
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never been experienced with Kim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Period at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is going to be a little bit
harsh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I might get people to hate me because
they're followers of the people,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in, uh, in the high time San
Bernardino cup and 17, I wanted to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: handle on what cam was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cat that I'm running around with
his, uh, his IG handles, uh, nine Oh seven
[SPEAKER_02]: or Falcon or nine Oh seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this kid has, uh, you know,
a hundred, 150,000 to $200,000 worth of
drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's got a whole list of genetics that
he's collected and he intends to maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: start up or, uh, using it someday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the hell he's doing with
it now, but he's collected it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's been a fortune to
collect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he knows every single person in,
and the backstories that's who I go to for
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, he's carrying me around and I go,
I want to smoke some, I didn't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: gorilla glue was or how to hold this to
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have no idea what one's so.
[SPEAKER_02]: He went over to JJ at, uh, top dog,
I do believe, and, uh, introduces and we
[SPEAKER_02]: are all talking and JJ like had a pre-roll
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe he rolled.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really remember it because I'd
smoked like 20 joints, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: we start smoking and it's my little
partner, AK Rizzo and, uh, and Falconer
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and, uh, JJ and we're smoking up and
man, the third or fourth hit around the.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big ass seed pops out of that shit and it
blows up like a grenade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, which you don't normally see a
lot of, usually you'll see them like few
[SPEAKER_02]: them out, like a little volcano,
but that shit popped.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, Oh, that's it's arch and
not nobody, you know, really wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, Oh no, we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: He go, I'll roll another one out of my
stash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go, no, no, we're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we rolled on and it's such a
poor example of what my first,
[SPEAKER_02]: my first chem dog was like, Oh,
so that's that, that's not really,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, real happy feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, then in Emerald that same year,
I was over there talking with,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, he goes by Montana Roy now,
you know, uh, Cody and, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: over at Duke's and, um, Duke disappeared
maybe to get a smoke or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, he, he goes, man, you,
you check out this chem dog, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: or yeah, chem dog, I think it was,
but, uh, he gives us a bunch of his
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave us like, you know, the,
he had killer flowers that that year he
[SPEAKER_02]: had the like dominion skunk and the granny
skunk and, uh, the local H and I think the
[SPEAKER_02]: dominion or the, uh, capital G and he had
such stinky ass bud pole cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, he gave us some of that cam and I
just sat right there and rolled it up and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, second or third hit of that shit going
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized what cam was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, Oh, they hit me between the
eyes and I was like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It overrode probably 15 other times I'd
smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that, you know,
cam's pretty serious, pretty serious,
[SPEAKER_02]: but so it's a good thing to judge by it's
got rankness to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a good standard to,
uh, compare a lot of things to,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm, I'm so inexperienced with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: First time ever that I was able to get my
hands on it and do something with it was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, uh, this year at Emerald.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, skunk V a gave me a nice handful of,
uh, crossroads cam and we were smoking the
[SPEAKER_02]: shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really great, but so,
um, I like it a lot, but I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: go down that road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, what could I do with cam that hasn't
been done?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's people that are
specializing in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I wouldn't say competing with
them because I don't, I don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: compete with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd make something equally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, share it with them,
but I'd say that there's a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: specializing in cam and I don't need to go
down that road at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a really kind of mature mindset
to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And definitely a huge shout out to Cody
and skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love all the skunk fam crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just out of curiosity, do you remember
which cam you tried?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it the 91 or maybe the D?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cam D.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what, um, there was a couple
of people standing there on that third
[SPEAKER_02]: round when the, when the joint came back
and, uh, they backed out and didn't take a
[SPEAKER_02]: fourth drag off of it because the shit was
starting to affect them heavily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good, that's a real good
standard to go by.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, it's probably a bit of a no
brainer, but if anyone, including yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: ever gets the chance to try some 91 from
skunk VA, do not pass up that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I would put it in my library and,
uh, I'm, I think I've been offered,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he was, he's always been really
great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I'm super well,
but he's always been super generous and
[SPEAKER_02]: offered me things, but I never took him up
on it, but I would keep it in my library.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I guess that finest, uh,
cut that was going around the cam.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, can be at the, uh, emerald this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a couple of people that grabbed
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might, uh, I might snatch that up
even though it's not the 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, heck, the D is, uh,
really comparable to the 91 in many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought of it as though it's not
quite as potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe if the chem 91 is kind of like
a hundred out of a hundred in potency,
[SPEAKER_01]: the chem D is like somewhere between 90 to
95, but the taste and the yield are much
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So commercially it kind of makes a bit
more sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know, uh, Mr. Bob grabbed up one
of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said his was doing real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, he was going to prove it out,
but I had heard from secondhand sources
[SPEAKER_02]: that, uh, P bud Mike confirmed that that
was the real, uh, can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think you can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard given there's so many different
chem D's at least three I know of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it's, there's, there's varying
voices vouching for each, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: heck, if P bud Mike is vouching for one
that that definitely stands for something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm, I heard it secondhand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't say, but, you know,
I was real lucky to, to be in the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: of the conversation with, uh, skunk VA
Tommy and, uh, or, you know, Duke and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, a couple of the other guys that were
actually at Emerald and, uh, AK Rizzo and
[SPEAKER_02]: I happened to just pop in at that moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, Duke grabs up skunk VA and tells
him to come over cause they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: settle this thing right now on provenance
on, uh, who had what on this chem D.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, Oh, I need to hear this
induced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of private conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we instantly just sucked up like flies
on the wall and listened to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, it's so valuable to
get, you know, five of, of people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, the holders of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all you hear is, well,
I got it in 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gave it to him in 93.
[SPEAKER_02]: It came from him already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the exact source.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then shit just gets squished.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, um, I've been really grateful to have
heard a few conversations like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the first time I was at Emerald
cup, um, just out of nowhere, not so dog
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of tapped me on the shoulder and
introduced himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's able to reveal a few things to me,
which was very interesting because he's
[SPEAKER_01]: tied into more things than you might know
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's funny with, uh,
with him that, um, I've got friends that
[SPEAKER_02]: had used him as good, good friend and
librarian and holder of keeper strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, he is, he is the further I see
has got his hands all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I've got a really good
friend that, uh, knows him, but that's who
[SPEAKER_02]: held El Haffey's, uh, that he's cat piss
and El Haffey did not have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during the fire lost everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, they thought it was gone forever,
but not so dog held it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, sativa seed stash, uh,
leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was able to go snatch that,
that thing up, get the cutting up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now he's got his, uh, cat piss either
coming back home or has it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's, it's so valuable to have
somebody like not so dog holding,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, might be years later,
but when it comes into play, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's an incredible value to everybody
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so him and Bob Hemphill, I think,
uh, in my mind are the two really notable
[SPEAKER_01]: librarian figures, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we just jump over to Bob for a minute,
um, I noticed on your Instagram feed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got some MTF cross NL one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you mentioned in the comments,
it was given to you by Bob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that the case?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was it like you, did he make it and
give it to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you make it and do something with
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that all tie together?
[SPEAKER_02]: No on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my MTF and my NL one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, uh, I have given Bob my MTF and,
uh, he could certainly have my NL one or
[SPEAKER_02]: both.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes to the standing, what I have right
now to it with no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, that's just something that I made
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to use NL one to, uh, I had to do
something to get seeds for Matanuska
[SPEAKER_02]: Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's really probably no better
choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean on that same kind of train of
thought your feed, it's essentially like a
[SPEAKER_01]: gold mine in terms of all the different
genetics on the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next thing which popped up to kind
of sprick my ears off was the Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: Lights Hayes hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were TK Northern Lights Hayes
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what's the backstory behind that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you want to kind of do with
those?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you're that observant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know if I knew what you know at your
age, like you're an incredible,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, human being, especially for your
age.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, uh, I value you a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just you have insight beyond a lot of
others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that being said, uh, that's,
that's a real, real, real special thing
[SPEAKER_02]: right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the TK NL5 Hayes, uh, we've been able
to work with it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my original Waco in the eighties,
we never knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a local plant, but it has to be NL5
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we never knew it looks, looks every
single thing about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the cover photo of the 8990 Sensi
catalogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we didn't buy it from Novell because,
uh, it looks so ratty on the cover photo,
[SPEAKER_02]: funnier than shit that we would pass on
something due to books.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, I've been able to get NL5 Hayes
from, uh, I think, uh, Mean Gene grew some
[SPEAKER_02]: in 98 from a friend of his in England.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might've been his first breeding or
first, uh, it could have been his first
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it was his first NL kind of cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, he did a seed increase and he gave
me some of that seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I grew on, I, uh,
I thought they were pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're super NL5 dominant, but I just
recently crossed that TK NL5 Hayes male to
[SPEAKER_02]: that NL5 Hayes to, uh, kind of do a back
cross on it and, um, go that route.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, as it stands TK NL5 Hayes is,
and this is going to go on record,
[SPEAKER_02]: but this is the, um, the finest,
uh, and best and strongest cannabis that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have come across in two decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big climb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to, I hate to, uh, go around and
keep repeating myself, but I have told,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, all my loved ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Local old heads, my partners and,
and, um, all my testers all are on board
[SPEAKER_02]: and a hundred percent don't they?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not taking anything for granted on
the deal, but, uh, I've sent it out to a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of people that are, um, they need to
be amazed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you did get sent the TK NL5 Hayes,
I don't care if it was the NL dominant or
[SPEAKER_02]: the TK Hayes dominant or a cross of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't sleep on it because it,
uh, Oh man, going out on a limb here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I do believe it's all of what Kim ever
was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it tastes better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just quickly, I just wanted to say,
thanks so much for those kind words.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I guess, does it go without saying
that this is the next type of line you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to work more or has already been
done?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's been done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just don't see where this bottleneck
that's created with 1000 cookie strains is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to go from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, it's going to revert back to,
uh, a lot of heirloom and I say even a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of land race genetics are going to get
re-added back, uh, for a lot of different
[SPEAKER_02]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, might not be uncontrollable hard to
grow wild strains, but there's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot more meat to, uh, to try to you
know, break the bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it has been done 10 ways to
Sunday for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll five haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you consider it like this,
uh, one of the, one of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledgeable and, uh, trustworthy and,
uh, old heads that are out there be at
[SPEAKER_02]: Rosenthal, you know, he, he had a good
opinion of, uh, NL five haze being the
[SPEAKER_02]: most potent, uh, smoke that he'd ever come
across.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like his favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then if you go on facts like
dynasty relic seeds has, uh, he has a,
[SPEAKER_02]: he has a 27% 19 year old cut of the cough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm, I'm imagining it as the Fort
Collins cough or the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was, it was named the cough,
but it was, uh, I think in, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably, uh, produced right out of Fort
Collins, but I've heard it called the
[SPEAKER_02]: Texas cough and other things too,
but it is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's an outstanding NL five haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was able to send Paul and of my TK NL
five haze to relic and he got a breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: done and being the gentleman that he is,
he sent me one over half of all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, which just, you know, totally
amazes me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably, uh, I could probably shout out
to him, uh, as being one of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, more heartfelt, uh, people that I've
come across in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, he's, he's a really good guy,
but we created a monster right there that,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, it's something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, that's something in the works,
but the TK NL five haze, I'm going to work
[SPEAKER_02]: at 10 ways to Sunday right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's going to be the next thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, if you got a high, if you have a
high tolerance to most profiles right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: this will take care of the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, you know, it's a 22nd onset type
of a plant that, uh, hits you like a
[SPEAKER_02]: brick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not that dizzy, spacey,
uh, high, like the Durbin tie high flyer
[SPEAKER_02]: or tie or Durbin, or any of the,
uh, super heady, like flying your head on
[SPEAKER_02]: a kite string type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff hits you like way different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an anti, it's a biovasculator very,
very, very heavily as like a medical
[SPEAKER_02]: biovasculator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get zero blood pressure in your
brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're smoking a big head of it and
hold it, it could, uh, it could floor you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many, many, many people busted their heads
on coffee tables or, uh, uh, whatever hard
[SPEAKER_02]: object that's nearby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a dangerous animal and it's no
joke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've told us to like a bunch of people and
they just like in one ear and out the
[SPEAKER_02]: other, cause they don't think such things
exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that in, in Neville's,
uh, description of the NL five H he said
[SPEAKER_02]: experienced smokers were, uh, you know,
having a urination and defecation and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, they lose bodily control over smoking
this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's a fact that stuff does medical,
uh, properties beyond any normal weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, it is definitely something that
I'm going to dig, uh, 10 foot ditch into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can a hundred percent attest to some of
those claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, certainly not the loss of
bodily function, but I mean, when I was at
[SPEAKER_01]: Bodie's place most recently, I was lucky
enough to try some C five Hayes,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the Neville's keeper cut of
Northern lights Hayes and Jesus,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been that high before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's truly something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to have to chase you up on
your one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's, that's truly interesting,
but now is the time for us to shower our
[SPEAKER_01]: buddy, Dr. P and some love, you know,
how did you first get introduced to
[SPEAKER_01]: dynasty genetics and what's your favorite
strain by them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I was totally disconnected from
internet for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was anti.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, when I did realize, well,
I'd say about 12 or 13 years ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: really, um, I realized that there was so
many forums and that there was on those
[SPEAKER_02]: forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like seed bank information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once I started, like I had a dozen
favorites and all of it was, I started to
[SPEAKER_02]: be getting addicted to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's, it's something that happens
to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then, uh, I, I started to see opinions
on what was what.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did buy some old seed stock right
then, but the professor pre and dynasty
[SPEAKER_02]: came along about maybe through maybe about
four years ago, but Rocky mountain seed
[SPEAKER_02]: bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw that they had a release of,
of, uh, platinum huckleberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd never seen cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about it and I thought I would
never want to have nothing to do with it
[SPEAKER_02]: because, uh, people are saying it's a low
yielding super elite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, I'd like to let it go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, run its course.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to, you know, 10 years later,
I might pick it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, that one sounded real interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I, I just got a pack of that from
the Rocky mountain, uh, seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know that that's an existing
seed bank right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little tiny, uh, uh, man and wife
operation, I think, but they treated me
[SPEAKER_02]: super right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, seeds made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got, um, everything on it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got two OG KB.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, dominant, uh, versions of super male
and a super female, the male like turned
[SPEAKER_02]: super black tons of resin, uh,
probably the nicest, uh, OG BK,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, I mean, KB, uh, type of, uh,
plant that I've come across for a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the females were just like super
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for three or four years, I,
I just been in love with, uh, I don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: know how I, I might've shouted him out one
time and he hit me back on a Friday night
[SPEAKER_02]: and told me to, you know, chill and have a
good weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, slowly we kind of talked and,
um, he, he, no, whatever boil down to,
[SPEAKER_02]: we became friends and, uh, he's a standup
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not enough, uh, can be said about him
being a good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got so much love for that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably can't put it in words,
but I guess, uh, kind of by virtue of what
[SPEAKER_01]: you said, the platinum Huck is your
favorite strand from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, uh, he is the pineapple
fields is outstanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything that he's made has got
something special going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, uh, blue Magoo was, uh, really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that the, um, Huckleberry,
the, um, the, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got about a pack of everything that
he has.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had sent me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but the, uh, vanilla cherry cookies
is, is off the hook, really a good keeper,
[SPEAKER_02]: really good smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I don't, I don't think that I
really have a favorite of his.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that he has proven all of his to
be really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not like no duds in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, each one has a pretty good,
uh, thing going for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even, you know, everything he crosses is
pretty well thought out and done up right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So his males were outstanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then his females, you know,
speak for themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but I tend to smoke a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do smoke a lot of the platinum
Huckleberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just as a little personal thing,
I've, I've grown the Platte Huckleberry
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies out before and I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I noticed was it's such a short
stocky plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, did you have any tips to how to
get around that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I just, I could never get it to
stretch at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that cookies was so dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: With one of ours, it's has to be caged.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll have 20, 20 and 30, uh, tentacle
branches that want to go, it'll go off
[SPEAKER_02]: like nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've crossed it with things like lemon
tree and, uh, central core with strong
[SPEAKER_02]: centers and slower growing to,
to just slow it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have one that, uh, it's OG KB
dominant and it just grows, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: nice central.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make it to be six and eight tops
easy enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, uh, real easy to grow and fast
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now is that was the version one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The V three now is a stocky or slower
growing one at Bush year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he says that it dominates more towards
the Oregon Huckleberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's faster in flower and a little bit
better flavor towards the, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Huckleberry, but it's slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some four month olds that are just
stocky as hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're wanting to look like, um,
like little trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you think yours was slow arm,
I don't know that it was the B three.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, uh, you can, you can hang
ornaments on it when it's Christmas time
[SPEAKER_02]: though, cause it's that sturdy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I definitely, definitely had that nice
strong branching for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I should clarify.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean that in a particularly
negative way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just was kind of wondering if you had
any tips or tricks for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on that same line of topic,
I noticed you have a little sub form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on Matt riots forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: How'd you strike up your friendship with
Matt?
[SPEAKER_01]: We love Matt on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're always interested to hear how people
met him.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a good one too, because I didn't
know who he was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, I think he,
uh, Oh, I know how is that I had,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, I had offered a little bit
on the Instagram of the old seed catalog
[SPEAKER_02]: collections and, uh, he, you know,
being that he's got the history.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, at least like I'd say 14,
going back 15 years, even working with
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville and, and, uh, you know,
the whole backstory there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it, uh, he hit me up with them
catalogs and it's like, wow, old head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine this, this dude's 50 years old
and old head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he wasn't what I, you know,
when you, when you meet him face to face,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's certainly not what, what your first
impressions are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I asked a Falconer, my, my buddy who's
the, uh, he's the go-to for information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this riot cat?
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, Oh man, that guy, man,
he got a lot of controversy, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll bring up, but he'll he's,
he's honest and he's straight and he'll
[SPEAKER_02]: put, he'll put, uh, he'll put a
motherfucker on blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's like, okay, I need to
check one of these live feeds out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This cat has, and, um, he shouts me out
big time on there for, um, for the
[SPEAKER_02]: catalog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it went from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent me, you know, a ton of seeds and a
bunch of packs of like reservoir,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, strawberry diesel F threes or whatever
the shit that Bruce banner came out of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he sent me packs and packs of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, well, I thought maybe you'd
want to sell it or auction it off or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, uh, it's like, Oh, he,
he is a good guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll, uh, he'll stand up for the right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, if your shit needs to go on blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the guy to, uh, talk to cause he's
knowledgeable and, and he's a Dick,
[SPEAKER_02]: but man, he's a Dick in a good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love, I love Bode's analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says he's like the pit bull and we need
the pit bull to go off at people
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: People, that's the best analogy in from a
good guy too, because you think about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: Bode is too nice of a guy and,
um, people might, I'm not going to say
[SPEAKER_02]: that he's non-convertational.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might know.
[SPEAKER_02]: He might be a seven degree black belt
drawing on like kill you in two seconds,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't think that he's going to go
bust in somebody's balls because they did
[SPEAKER_02]: him wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, Matt ain't going to
let that shit happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, he'll go out of his way to,
you know, make shit right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I know for sure there's another
side of that and a P a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, take it or leave it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a fuck what they think about
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I just kind of like to,
uh, stay straight with everybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: but shit, Matt's a good guy to go to for
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, he's way more into the,
uh, breeding knowledge for fems and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I have any kind of questions and
shit like that, that I need to know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be right to him on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely wanted to add, we definitely
need to get Matt back on the show for a
[SPEAKER_01]: catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's, he's always got some funny anecdotes
to say, but does looping back to a
[SPEAKER_01]: different post I saw on your Instagram,
I noticed that professor P had sent you
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of CBD stuff from the new relic
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed that you mentioned you've
got your own kind of CBD thing going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you mind telling us a bit about your
CBD project?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's, uh, it's pretty, uh,
it's pretty ongoing and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting to be widespread because,
uh, basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: About March of, uh, 17, I was like
affected very badly by something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'd done, you know, literally a
thousand tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I might be dying from heavy
metal poisoning from painting cars for 30
[SPEAKER_02]: years, or I thought I might just be dying
from whatever I was dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, we got it diagnosed after tons of
trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just turned out to be a form of RA
and it's called polyarthritis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like one of the worst forms of
already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just hammers your joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was about 80% disabled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was, it was ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no putting on, I couldn't do my
belt or put on socks or shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, it was bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather just about, uh, roll up on a
ball and fucking die because of pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we ended up getting it into
remission.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to a specialist and put first,
my doctor just put me on, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: opiates and fucking, uh, methotrexate not
methotrexate at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be steroids cause he's like
a general practitioner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, we got, I went to the,
um, rheumatologist and he gets me
[SPEAKER_02]: straightened out off of, uh, told me to
suffer it out, swell up like hell,
[SPEAKER_02]: come back in pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he'll tell me what's up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did go straight for, uh,
he tried two or three different little
[SPEAKER_02]: concoctions and nothing worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: He instantly gets me on an injection of
methotrexate and then a deloxetine,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was like a, uh, pain blocker,
but it's more, it's diagnosed for,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, depression.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just makes you happy about your
fucking arthritis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, uh, it might be the better drug,
but yeah, methotrexate puts that and I get
[SPEAKER_02]: it in remission to where I could go back
to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I worked through the whole time,
but it was brutal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was, it was truly one of the
harder things I've done in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I realized that CBD could take
that swelling out like crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was buying and checking out different
CBD flowers and we ended up trying ACDC
[SPEAKER_02]: and Pennywise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that, um, Northstar, it might have
been who was breeding it for a sub cool,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I tried a couple of different ones and
it turned out that the stuff had an actual
[SPEAKER_02]: medical effect to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, my wife has Crohn's disease,
fierce and has had an ileostomy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if she has like a terrible flare up,
the stuff could work wonders for internal
[SPEAKER_02]: inflammation reduction and, uh,
such a good thing, CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I realized that it's some road that we
have to go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I started collecting,
um, a bunch of the best examples that I
[SPEAKER_02]: can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, ACDC, I, uh, got a decent 20
to one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got, I got a couple from the nature
farm, uh, API, apathetic, uh, purple
[SPEAKER_02]: indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 15, a three to 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody always says 15 to one and you
know, they got it backwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I generally say it the way it's
supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a three to 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I got Canna Montana from,
uh, King J out of, uh, out of Montana
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, his can of Montana is a really nice
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we've probably got 15 different
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, Willie G's Lebanese, but they can
go, um, easy one to 20 and, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, monster, uh, Lebanese plants
that can just be crazy, uh, have all the
[SPEAKER_02]: good things of a wild Lebanese.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I don't know if it'll adapt well
to the indoor gardens, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: that and that Charlotte's gift from relic
that you mentioned that Charlotte's gift
[SPEAKER_02]: is, uh, you know, Charlotte's web and
Ringo's gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he has it to an F three when he
gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I asked him if he minded that,
um, you know, we use the males and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he's a hundred percent doesn't,
uh, doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, he's the best guy in the world,
but that's going to be, uh, one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: components.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, my goal is to just make something
that's about 10 to 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be to me a one to two, uh,
and then I want it to be something that
[SPEAKER_02]: makes me happy, which would be the main
goal with most people smoking flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely want something pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you predict will be the future
of the CBD orientated strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially given there's this sentiment
within the community that the kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients who are really in need of the CBD
have kind of been left behind now that
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization has come and passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, that's a real, uh, problem
because it has come to that, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD flowers, not something that,
um, people, you know, where I always think
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor growing, but down, down in a lot of
areas, it's legalizing now that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not relying on indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're relying on, um, like death or
greenhouse or outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, they won't owe much or any of
their time and genetics or garden or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever it takes to make a decent
amount of medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to just boil down to large
industrial hemp type of operations for
[SPEAKER_02]: people to get medications.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not thinking that it's the worst thing
in the world because it's come a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, the CBD plants that, uh,
I'm going to give another shout out right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a good one to do it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, cloud co-farms on Instagram has
a full spectrum CBD that's available and
[SPEAKER_02]: they have their own products.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, uh, it's all packaged and for sale
and individual doses and at retail shops,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're also a company that's willing
to sell at the wholesale level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, fairly small doses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy a 100 gram, uh, that's
probably the lowest, uh, price break that
[SPEAKER_02]: you get, but a hundred grams of their full
spectrum distillate is $10 a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the best medicines I've
ever come across.
[SPEAKER_02]: It, it actually has a fairly high amount
of, uh, THC in it to where if you're not a
[SPEAKER_02]: smoker, you're going to be, uh,
much more recreationally medicated than
[SPEAKER_02]: you're wanting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it is just enough to make the CBD
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also has every other cannabinoid in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So their product is one of the best I've
ever come across.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not, they're not out to be,
you know, the corporate king and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, they've expanded from one size
operation to the next without killing the
[SPEAKER_02]: little guy and, um, leaving the
opportunity open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do believe last year he planted,
uh, almost 100 acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went from a small deal, but he still
has his indoor greenhouses over the winter
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's showing 100% love, uh,
100% of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, as long as he can sustain that
guys like that, or, uh, that's where all
[SPEAKER_02]: of the, uh, I think medical benefits
probably can end up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be flour for the people,
but it's still going to be a high quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: full wide spectrum, uh, cannabinoid,
uh, distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has isolate also, but you know,
isolate doesn't work the same as
[SPEAKER_02]: distillate and the full spectrum is better
than anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of value to people like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just banged out my next question,
which was going to be, what do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: is the most medicinal of all the,
uh, the type of, you know, full spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: extract, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, uh, that thing contends with
anything because you can, uh, it's such a
[SPEAKER_02]: good high quality product to say that
you're into extracts and you might do dabs
[SPEAKER_02]: on a, on a quartz dab rig or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it tastes really good and,
uh, it's a very quick onset medically when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing a dab, the, the length of it
isn't going to last you as long,
[SPEAKER_02]: but his products are so good that it
tastes great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you'd near grab the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's very potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wouldn't say you could comfortably,
uh, most people wouldn't want to work and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and be doing a bunch of dabs of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that potent on the wide cannabinoid,
uh, you know, full spectrum side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the best medicine, but it's also,
it's a really good, uh, mixture to where
[SPEAKER_02]: it really does work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's a real, I wouldn't say a
perfect cause somebody in a lab is
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely going to make something that
could be get right past the blood brain
[SPEAKER_02]: barrier and, uh, and be the top of the
line through, you know, through lab work
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for just a natural product,
his is, is it's pretty top of the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never met anybody that doesn't get on
board when they find out about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like good advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we just loop back to a topic we were
talking about before, I remember you were,
[SPEAKER_01]: you were talking about cookies,
you know, where do you think it'll go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that you've been working with
this F3 Durban and my thoughts are now
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've played with the Durban a bit,
do you, are you more convinced or less
[SPEAKER_01]: convinced that it's actually a part of the
cookie genetic makeup?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I'm convinced that it's
nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my Durban is not their Durban for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, and there's plenty of,
uh, different Durban's, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is original SSSC's Durban stock and,
uh, I could breed it 10 ways to Sunday and
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe I'm getting cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I think that maybe, uh,
cookies is probably just like Hindu Kush
[SPEAKER_02]: and Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that's probably really all it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that Hindu Kush idea has been thrown
around a bit, especially given that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get these kind of real savory bakery
shop type of things out of Hindu Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: That and my NL1 leaf pattern in its
extreme form is a denner example to the
[SPEAKER_02]: most extreme OG KB leaf pattern.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I can go back to 1985 and have a
leaf pattern with shit loads of fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: photographic evidence and I can reproduce
it right now on an OG KB, it tells me a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, most certainly, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think inspector from CSI has
said something along those lines about
[SPEAKER_01]: when you do S1's of Mendo perps,
you likewise get that same phenotype and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Mendo perps is sorry,
not Mendo perps, Purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_01]: My apologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you, when you S1 Purple Urkel,
you get that OG KB phenome and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think anyone would deny that, uh,
Purple Urkel's probably got some NL or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some pure Afghanica in it,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say it has to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been, uh, I could think of 10
strains straight up, uh, that I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have experience with because I never made
it up here during the, uh, I'd say 85 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 2005.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it wasn't in my hands, I didn't need
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm that kind of guy that doesn't look for
a greener pasture and, uh, very happy with
[SPEAKER_02]: what I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I never saw Purple Urkel until,
I mean, the very first time I had anything
[SPEAKER_02]: to do was 12 years ago with Querkel and
that's half Purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then since then I've heard stories
that have been, you know, put out that it
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't even half Purple Urkel,
that it was, it was, uh, um, a lavender
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I had no experience with Purple
Urkel, but recently I did and do have,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, it's a real unique plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leafs want, mine want to point upwards
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a very, uh, NL, uh, dominant leaf
pattern, even though it'll go to like
[SPEAKER_02]: easily go to 11 fingered leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I never got 11 fingered leafs ever off
of NL and, uh, but it's a super unique
[SPEAKER_02]: type of plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, uh, it's coming down from that
line, uh, it's crossed to something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, and it happens to be that mine is
a F2 of, uh, the CSI's Purple Urkel too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but it's a fantastic thing that he
preserved and has passed on too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, um, it smells good in beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the things like, like I'll go
back to, I like weed that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like most of the reason that I make
flour and love flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I love to be pleased by good flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't wait until, uh, I have big
piles of that Purple Urkel flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely the, that end feeling of
consuming the flour is definitely,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely worth the effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you brought up an interesting
point, you know, as time goes by,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's certainly been, at least in the
past year or so, a bit of controversy
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounding TGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and our buddy Subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that being said, you know,
I think most people have a strain that
[SPEAKER_01]: they hold somewhat near and dear that
comes from TGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for me personally, I got a brilliant,
I got two brilliant cuts of Chernobyl that
[SPEAKER_01]: I just adore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never, never give them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how much controversy surrounds
the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything like that,
that, you know, near and dear to your
[SPEAKER_01]: heart from TGA?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of love for old TGA because
they, uh, they put some really good
[SPEAKER_02]: combinations together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that blood rec was probably
the best thing that they made and things
[SPEAKER_02]: down from blood rec or off the hook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, uh, I was completely blown away
when I was able to get a crazy train,
[SPEAKER_02]: original crazy train about, um,
it was about 11 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I got it from the,
the hemp depot of all places because that
[SPEAKER_02]: place is shady as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, the, uh, what I got was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I fell in love with TGA because
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also had space Jill at the time,
the actual, what they called space Jill,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's what they were selling it as.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was exactly like their description.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it's a little bit too much of a
biomass for me, but still, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a great, uh, producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I crossed it to Chocolo.
[SPEAKER_02]: This, this is a long time back now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, going on at least 11 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I crossed that to Chocolo that
space, Jill, and I call it tropical.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fantastic thing that I've made.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just recently, uh, passed that down to
miss Jill and, uh, she didn't want it when
[SPEAKER_02]: she was with TGA and, uh, you know,
they were doing their own thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, um, another really, really
impressive, uh, thing that TGA uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: they had a limited release of locomotion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called by heroes of the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, Pat did a really good job making
that it's blue city diesel bread to time
[SPEAKER_02]: wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how many packs went out,
but, um, I guess quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at some cool house at, uh,
in 17 in the summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, he was open in a box that came in
from Pat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, had 20,000, one Ziploc bag had
20,000 locomotion seats in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he also had quite a few backups of a
couple others, but the total, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: at $2 a seat, it was a $60,000,
uh, check you had to cut over to pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that's his personal business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't be talking about it,
but I know that, uh, quite a bit of that
[SPEAKER_02]: locomotion seed was produced and still is
getting produced, but they had it under
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had it understated on their,
on their profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I instantly told sub cool that that
thing had to be changed to over the top,
[SPEAKER_02]: over the top, uh, turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I don't know if it's,
uh, all good coming from the blue city
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel or if it's the mix with the time
wreck, but, uh, that's a, that's something
[SPEAKER_02]: that I can't live without on a daily basis
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep it at all points in time since I've
got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I breathe it quite a bit because
it's one of my only true purples.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get, uh, I get insane color from it,
but the, uh, the flavor in the high,
[SPEAKER_02]: it only tested out at, uh, I had a couple
of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tested analytically.
[SPEAKER_02]: One was 13.8.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one I keep, but the terpings
were very high on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, with the pro the profile of the
terpings and that, that cannabinoids the
[SPEAKER_02]: way they are, it hits like a 25%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of anything that just has that,
that THC spike.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's, it's a pretty great thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So TJ has put in their time, whether
they've, uh, you know, whether they've
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of, uh, gone and done different
things than they've done in the past and
[SPEAKER_02]: you follow them or not, there was a lot of
good value to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you find an old package of like,
oh, five third dimension, I would
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly crack it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a lot of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that, uh, Apollo work they did was
definitely a value.
[SPEAKER_01]: But while we're on the topic, what are
some of your favorite old school seed
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, whether they be around anymore?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they might be defunct.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might be still operating,
but what are some of the old ones you
[SPEAKER_01]: loved?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's kind of weird for me
because for 20 years, I didn't know that
[SPEAKER_02]: they existed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I did find out about 12 years ago
that the internet was you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: available, I mean, I was like,
I could give a shit about the,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I basically want to, uh, live my life and
never have to ever go on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm, uh, I utilize it for
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I had to order something off of
Amazon, it's, it's pretty handy or,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, look up a strain review.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find out some instant information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other than that, I don't need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I did find out there was companies
available and I, I dipped into it a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first things I liked was,
uh, DNA is a chocolo pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the idea of that pure sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it turns out, you know, whether people
there's controversy behind that like crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: to say, and they stole their look minds
and lied about what it was and this and
[SPEAKER_02]: that makes me want to have to,
uh, you know, discount them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now what they're doing,
you know, they've blown up so big now that
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't follow somebody like that or even,
um, I can't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them any love.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still have a ton of chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, thousands of seeds of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then projects of it that are,
I still keep them cut form 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 years of my crazy train.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my skunk cabbages, you know,
TGA and DNA that's crazy train and
[SPEAKER_02]: chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the thing that I, I go to as my
go to, to get stoned when other things
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't get me high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so that question's hard for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I go back to seed companies that I
love.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would only probably be SSSC and,
you know, the seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have no contact for a long time
after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then modern guys, I love dominion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he doesn't put anything out that isn't
worthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love, uh, you know, dynasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can think of probably 20,
you know, mean gene, those guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just don't cut corners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that's who I'd say I love as,
as a seed producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, that's, that's a hard question
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess if I'm going to play devil's
advocate here, how do you feel European
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics in general have influenced the
world stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you feel about them now in
terms of their overall state of affairs?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that through, uh,
the very first, uh, wave of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was really good influence for the whole
entire world, the best influence that
[SPEAKER_02]: could be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But within 10 years, there was more,
uh, industry, um, infiltration from they'd
[SPEAKER_02]: taken proprietary genetics back and forth,
stealing them and backstabbing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause everybody was trying to,
to get something in the only legal market
[SPEAKER_02]: in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, through that they'd either
misbred, lied, and you know, it came about
[SPEAKER_02]: to water down their genetics severely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, the state of European genetics was
a gold mine that could have been tapped
[SPEAKER_02]: and still there are some holdouts of it,
but I do believe that it's, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not compared to, uh, it's never been
compared to Alaskan genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, there's no possible way it
ever could because the morals were just
[SPEAKER_02]: like completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we were breeding for ourselves
and they were supplying the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they didn't give a shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were making money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it, it weakened the world
state of cannabis fiercely over the last
[SPEAKER_02]: decade, especially for at least from Oh
five.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there was garbage and Oh five Euro
trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it and be so harsh on the
people because you know, there's some good
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders and they're still putting in good
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are guys that are still doing
some pretty good out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, uh, I personally know them and,
um, or I know some companies that are
[SPEAKER_02]: working like through Spain just because
it's the only legal outlet and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: putting in a lot of love and, uh,
I can say that they, they're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: clean up what Europe watered down and
spread out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you feel about kind of some of
the European breeders, most notably strain
[SPEAKER_01]: hunters having gone into these land race
areas and traded European genetics for the
[SPEAKER_01]: indigenous ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I got to say Franco was, uh,
on the right path.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I think they did a lot of,
uh, bad along with good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They certainly didn't hunt in the very
good spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't do a real thorough selection
and, um, did not hunt in the right spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they watered down stuff by bringing
in European stuff, they, they probably
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't like do so much detrimental,
uh, you know, alteration because they
[SPEAKER_02]: never were in the right spots in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, half of that team was all about
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one was all about, you know,
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you feel smoking cannabis in
conjunction with tobacco affects it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel it really doesn't make too
much of a difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you feel like it does kind of
detract or add to things?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question because,
um, it's so popular with people making,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, using tobacco wraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've, I think I've smoked three of
them in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't go straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: For, um, tobacco wraps and, uh,
I got a lot of respect for the people that
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see a problem with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes my throat kind of harsh and,
uh, tickle a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am, I'm an, I'm a anti tobacco
advocate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd say natural wholesome, good old
fashioned heirloom Indian tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole different, um, thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know in different parts of the
world, they certainly do just straight up
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed tobacco and hash or tobacco and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just their system and that's
their style.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wouldn't be able to hang with those
guys.
Shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That should make it, I'd be greener in
hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, tobacco just doesn't do me any
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can, I can relate on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fairly anti tobacco myself,
but something I do like to point out to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to show that it's not a one-sided view
is like there's actual studies done,
[SPEAKER_01]: which show that when you mix tobacco with
cannabis, it actually results in a greater
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of THC being released and
essentially not combusted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's scientifically proven.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get more high from smoking with
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always try to keep that in mind
whenever I get on my high horse.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't, uh, I don't want to
discount anybody that does roll a blunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could say I've been floored by fuckers
that bust out the blunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of them is, uh, uh,
down at Emerald, uh, Tony, he has,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, Oh man, it's slipping my mind is
extract company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he's hooked up with the, uh,
pharmacy factory a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, um, shit that cat, uh, he'd roll up a
blunt that the weed was just super really
[SPEAKER_02]: good, but it was the right kind of blunt
because it wasn't super annoying to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had super pleasurable time smoking
it, but then I've smoked some bad,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, a couple of like, I don't know if it
was what it is, the, the rap or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: but man, uh, not as pleasurable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly don't have nothing against it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd grow my own tobacco in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I, um, just for the look of it,
it's a cool looking plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of, uh, I love plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are so limited on shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might even grow a big patch of tobacco
this summer right next to like a batch of
[SPEAKER_02]: hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, um, they're an interesting kind
of phenomena taking over, but you touched
[SPEAKER_01]: on the perfect point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to go to next given you live in
this rather remote place and it's hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow things outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of things do grow well outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, and in terms of cannabis,
do you still see ruderalis on the side of
[SPEAKER_01]: the road type of thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was that more of like a myth than a
reality?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think there was ever wild,
uh, ruderalis up here ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I came across plants in the nineties
that we don't know where the ruderalis
[SPEAKER_02]: gene came from because I had bought in
the, in the nineties I bought,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the skunk one and the, uh,
uh, indica ruderalis from a sensei seed
[SPEAKER_02]: bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we tried to grow it up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like smoke, you know, it's like at
this first stages, it was ruderalis skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to get one or two that
tasted with some decent, uh, smells and
[SPEAKER_02]: rust were cardboard, but there was never a
wild strain up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've, uh, we've been able to do a lot of
environmental kind of studies by pushing
[SPEAKER_02]: plants to the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where I'm at at this exact latitude,
we know a mild winter, we can get five
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, shit, it's just that close to
finishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody was to tweak it or say,
uh, use an auto, not an auto flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause I'm friends like crazy with
Mephisto's and I grow a lot of his auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: His, uh, his stuff's a whole different
thing and it does work up here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they just get done super quick and,
uh, and they're not like other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get, they just do their thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I want to have something like a semi
auto that would, uh, flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before the light is telling it to maybe
start triggering at 16 hours instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: the slowly 14 hour trigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'd have two weeks advance on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, cause I think maybe the Iranian
thought of something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pseudo auto and I've got some
blueberries like that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're experimenting and who knows we,
we might alter the course of, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: of the cannabis to meet our environment
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we keep playing with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's interesting that you
bring up blueberry cause I see that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: worked with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You even gave me a pack of seeds as a
blueberry hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your impression of the strain and
are you kind of a DJ short fan in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not an anti DJ short,
but I have never, uh, never grown his
[SPEAKER_02]: strains ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've, uh, I think what I gave you was a
blueberry nine pound hammer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, we proved that pretty well in the,
uh, growing LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was for avid, which was, um,
you know, pretty big aeroponics company.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were on the stock exchange and they
were building up, uh, for selling the IPO
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, crazy shit happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CFO and the CEO had like hostile
takeover shit happened to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about $60 million in accounts that
got froze up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was doing test grows for those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at nine pound hammer, blueberry nine
pound hammer was in there doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of videos of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it did, it did excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody kind of loved it, but the,
uh, I got off track to what the hell was
[SPEAKER_02]: the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Ian, did he into DJ short?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, DJ short.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've, uh, we just always been sick with
blueberry up here and nobody's ever said
[SPEAKER_02]: the word DJ short, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blueberry was so common up here in
1995 that everybody grew up on it and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're sick as shit of blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They even like it up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very interesting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's interesting because a lot of
people will say that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like maybe they read an article from DJ
short in the early years and maybe that
[SPEAKER_01]: helped them with their breeding or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever read any articles,
be it from various authors or were you
[SPEAKER_01]: just very much kind of self-taught?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, mostly self-taught, but I definitely
read and got told a lot of like my little
[SPEAKER_02]: partner, AK Rizzo, um, he's a stay at home
dad, so he can, you know, find those
[SPEAKER_02]: articles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's something that, that is even
curious to me, which seems to be
[SPEAKER_02]: everything is he relays it straight to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I get a lot of good information
and I've read and found and read as much
[SPEAKER_02]: as I could and certainly do follow a,
I like the idea of, uh, like DJ shorts had
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerative, uh, practices of,
um, getting full summer growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I liked the practices of his kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that you've got it,
you've got it going on for his,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, thing that he's got there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both doing really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing of our, our blueberry is,
uh, mostly always been just sativa up
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of other blueberries in the world
turn purple and are indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have some mean, mean, mean
blueberry sativa like indoor average easy
[SPEAKER_02]: one pound per plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was a stack up, finished good fast
and over the top blueberries, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just our home and it's AK blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like so many, there's Fairbanks
blueberry, Salcha blueberry, gooseberry
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a couple others, one called Arctic
blue, uh, Arctic blue and the Dean's beans
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry are both the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're about a 25, uh, plus year old
cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I, I have, I've run that Arctic
blue in the shit out of it to just
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's so old, but, uh, you know,
those types of plants with the
[SPEAKER_02]: generational drift, they want to be hard
as hell to root, uh, hard to get to going
[SPEAKER_02]: into beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to completely shave their legs
and give them like a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 times oversized Potter to get them to
encourage the hormones to go into the
[SPEAKER_02]: growth tip and start producing vegetative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to stay in the flower all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they shock from anything overfeeding,
uh, not keeping the bottoms cleaned or
[SPEAKER_02]: small roots, they just, they just straight
up auto flower, which is a good house
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause in the middle of summer,
you can have the most beautiful smell on
[SPEAKER_02]: blueberry plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in the kitchen window, a little
breeze blowing in and just blows blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: smell all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really do nice as a, a pseudo auto,
but that has something that's happened to
[SPEAKER_02]: them from, you know, just being old guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea of genetic drift or kind of loss
of vigor is, is an interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And recently we've seen a lot of people
engaging in this Maristem tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: culturing, which kind of is said to
rejuvenate clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you've heard about and
maybe possibly interested in yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard about it and I, uh,
I approve of the, uh, regenerative,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going to be, uh,
helpful to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any dudding or slow,
uh, something that's not, they can't be
[SPEAKER_02]: rooted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's just basically, if you have
something that's that old and kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: pain in the butt, um, make it grow faster
to get the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it makes a looser cellular
formation stuff with that real tight
[SPEAKER_02]: cellular formation that almost turns to
wood.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of ways around, uh,
making plants like that grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I've been just curious just now
if I can like give light doses of algebra,
[SPEAKER_02]: I like acid and 30 to 50 parts per million
to plants like the lemon tree,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it grows, you have to grow it
under a 65 K to get it to stretch or it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you put it under 4,000, it'll sit down
on itself and have 20 inner nodes at three
[SPEAKER_02]: feet tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that thing will be four or five
months in bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, little tricks like 6,500 K and
maybe 30 to 50 parts per million of some
[SPEAKER_02]: algebraic acid, you can get internautal
length to come up from a quarter inch to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, one or two inches and then make
that thing move.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of things that run through my
mind a whole lot nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this brings us to a perfect little
segue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you grow organically or are you more of
a synthetic based grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really a good one because I have,
uh, forever done crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we've always had animals, lots of them
for, for 20, 25 years, long time ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: we had way over a hundred wild boar that I
was buying them from like the Bronx zoo.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get them from like the San Diego
wildlife conservation would sell their
[SPEAKER_02]: extra piglets and they had, uh,
you know, 36 chromosome wild boar from a
[SPEAKER_02]: black, uh, the black forest line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, the Bronx who had the zygote
line, which was from Sweden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had all of these, uh, like Lima,
uh, Ohio would have wild exotic auctions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just straight up by Polish
imports.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're picking up all of these 36
chromosome wild boars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would have regular animals too,
but we had to have, um, something exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we would, uh, always have corn mash or
corn oats and barley generally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, soaked or molasses coated with soaking
barrels for a week before we feed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 20 years ago, I realized that stuff
will grow IMO on the top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, sometimes we tap a little bit of
the water off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can either brew it and make like,
you know, some really good hooch,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you could, uh, give it to the animals
and they get a little bit buzzed off of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would, uh, I never knew to put
lactic acid into it and turn it to like a
[SPEAKER_02]: sedic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would, uh, just lightly water the
plants with it as like a nutritional boost
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking that the starches would
definitely be good for the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, if you let it sit too long,
you grow an IMO on the top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that made me, you know, for a long
time, I'd been doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd always get, uh, tons up to,
you know, up to tons at a time of food
[SPEAKER_02]: from connections for our animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would let certain things ferment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized about the, um, like the
Korean natural farming practices,
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that's what it was called,
but we would, uh, you know, I'd seen the
[SPEAKER_02]: value of fermenting things because I've,
I have, uh, worked for 30 plus years for a
[SPEAKER_02]: Korean and, uh, we eat a lot of kimchi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what fermentation does for,
you know, it's very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of different things fermented are
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, we've always kind of ate natural
diets and tons of fermented stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured the plants are going to
benefit by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I found out later the whole time
that we'd just been doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: natural practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, of all these organic styles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say I haven't bought a lot of
bottles of, uh, of, uh, pre-made foods,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the ones that I did buy, I would say
35 years ago, we used echo grow and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, it, it's not soluble.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd have to mix it for an hour before
you could use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, they kind of went away and I used
something called a ESU, which was energy
[SPEAKER_02]: sun university.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, for about 10 years, that product
was around and it changed its name to NSR.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has since gone off the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I ever had to go to a bottle
nutrient, that's what I would go to
[SPEAKER_02]: because it never rebuilt salts up,
never burnt the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a, uh, you know, an indicator for
pH in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was real, real easy to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have, you know, we'll take like a
lot of our fermented fruit for our animals
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll just straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Been forever making FFJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my garage, I probably have 25,
five gallon buckets of FFJ in multiple
[SPEAKER_02]: forms and then maybe five gallons of FFA,
the fish amino acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got some barrels of, uh,
you know, seaweed collected from the ocean
[SPEAKER_02]: to straight up right off the shoreline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Massive collections of, uh, seaweed and
I'll, I'll ferment that and then put,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, lactic acid on it and let it brew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll put an IMO that I grow and,
uh, you know, let it inoculate and then go
[SPEAKER_02]: from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try to keep like good live soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all the time I'll recycle my soil
and refurbish it then, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kick it to the side using EM1 or any of my
IMOs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just, uh, refurbish it real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it sit in tubs sometimes over the
whole winter indoors in the garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I use it too much or don't want it,
I'll put it into my outdoor gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing you asked earlier, what does
grow up here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Barely anything grows up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So berries, I have a lots of berries,
black currants, raspberries, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, tons of, uh, current just different
bushes and, uh, apple trees and any of the
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff I grow, I put it in my old nutrient
dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's living right, right into my,
uh, gardens and generally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll, any leaf that hits it, it'll just
eat it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The IMO would just gobble it up into a
pure white, uh, you know, mycelia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really some pretty nice live soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, now that we know how you grow,
we've got to ask the other end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum, what type of lighting technology
do you like to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you think will be the future
of lighting technology?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I was thinking about that,
you know, the other day when I saw the,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, high times about 15 years ago,
advertising 6,000 watt plasma lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think they're landing craft lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was going to be the future way
back when.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, now I see a change about every
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an advancement in light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use, uh, force 1000 watt, 500 watt
emitters.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they're 1000 watt, uh,
double enders, but they're 500 watt,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, CMH they call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always call them LECs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, those are really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are just loving the,
uh, like a 3000R spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like super pimp lights,
but I also like some, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: good ass LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use quite a bit of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, um, I like, uh, California light
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they make really good product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had real good success.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, uh, the spider lights they're,
uh, you know, the biofluorescent spider
[SPEAKER_02]: lights, uh, they're a little bit
expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes up to being about $3 a watt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're kind of prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the price is finally coming around
and the quality is about the same on
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're coming down to about a thousand
dollars for those 600 and 650 watt units.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, but I also am big on,
uh, timber grow lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll shout out the timber grow lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, his 480 SAMs are,
uh, very inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: He uses Meanwell drivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they cover really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll replace, uh, the 480 SAMs will
replace the 1000 and they really are a
[SPEAKER_02]: good light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use a bunch of his cobs also,
you know, a hundred watt emitter cobs,
[SPEAKER_02]: some 50 watt emitter cobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he'll, he'll sell those,
uh, kits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wire it yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got like a clone cabinet or a
re-vegging cabinet or a breeding you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, I've got the craziest grows cause
I'll have a hundred projects going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got revegetive state going on and
I've got multiple breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You draw them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so I like LEDs for that purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't just stick a, I have quite a
few, uh, six 30, the 315 watt LECs too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, uh, they are not something that I
would, uh, recommend.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're better off, I think with the 315s
and spreading them out every, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: two, two feet, two and a half feet,
uh, versus like the twin six thirties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean the twin 315s because you're just
concentrating too much light and a little
[SPEAKER_02]: central focal point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I quit using those, uh,
the six thirties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, we've talking about kind of
genetic drift as well as lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's almost inevitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get to this topic, but how do you feel
reveging affects a plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like there's a lasting
difference there after reveging a plant or
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just essentially a very time
inefficient way of keeping a clone?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, it does have multiple answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't think that it hurts most
strains because some strains come from
[SPEAKER_02]: equatorial land race.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to see 11 to 14 hour,
uh, time periods that somebody will go
[SPEAKER_02]: into, uh, it'll veg it like 14 hours and
flower at 11.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a fine line in between there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, if you're going up more towards
the 36 parallel and you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, either high land or low land Indica,
they do a different thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did, they never do rebedge their,
their life cycles over at the end of their
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're genetically programmed a pretty
much die.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think reveging any plant hurts it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, um, and I've heard, I've had a bunch of
people that are older than me,
[SPEAKER_02]: try to educate me and tell me these other
things and what it will do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I utilize it quite a bit, uh,
reveging a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found out males revenge much faster than
females.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I revege a ton of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it hurts anything,
but I do believe that each plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics are where it varies for if it,
if it is going to change it or hurt it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you did mention earlier that,
um, putting plants outside as a way of
[SPEAKER_01]: rejuvenating them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you ever able to do that in Alaska or
it's, it's still rather limited the
[SPEAKER_01]: timeframe?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we have four months of solid summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will our light gains about five minutes
and 50 seconds a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every 10 days you're looking at an hour
of game, you know, so we have this massive
[SPEAKER_02]: light swing and it's 22 and 23 hours where
I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that, that's my time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go any further north, it's straight
up 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the damn UV index is so high in the
middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's equivalent of, uh, Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people that come up here from
Phoenix and San Diego, and it'll be 75 and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're telling us bullshit at 75.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going, it's at least 95.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hundred and they're dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just our son.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the angle of that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the UV index.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have four months to where you can,
you can definitely regenerate a plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: you, Oh man, you can make some crazy
bushes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't be able to move the thing and
you won't have nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't have a place big enough to
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that something you've done yourself
or just thinking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I will.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if I had a mother that, uh,
I hammered the shit out of, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, they're so poor at that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were to put them into flower,
you will get nothing on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if you, you know, were to seed it
to do a little last ditch effort to save
[SPEAKER_02]: the genetics, you still really are in a
bad shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would take like a mother that's been
over cut and then give it a full four
[SPEAKER_02]: months and let it get to the five and six
foot point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll be almost as fresh as it was if
it had never been beat to shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an advantage there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do that every summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something I noticed on the alternative
end of the spectrum to the sun is I seen a
[SPEAKER_01]: post or two about you germinating plants
around the moon cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you do frequently and
what type of effect do you think it has?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been told, told by a lot of
people that it's real proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've, uh, I've even said it's come out
of my mouth that I don't practice that
[SPEAKER_02]: hippie shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's crazy what I've said,
but I've contradicted myself because I,
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe that the pole of the,
uh, the ocean, it has a lot to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: everything in nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the magnetic fields that we have no
understanding of period, look how animals,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, get around the whole world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's due to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have knowledge way past our
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I'm dealing with old seeds that are
25 and 30 years old, some of them never
[SPEAKER_02]: were put up correctly at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you are praying to God and hoping
that the moon's pull will anything to get
[SPEAKER_02]: you through on a whole genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I practice that quite a bit and it's
just a good timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of thought, you know, you,
uh, straight box is real aware of all the
[SPEAKER_02]: moon cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am too, because I'm, you know,
I'm into the, um, farmer's almond act and
[SPEAKER_02]: fishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what every tide is because I have
to know where my tide book is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a, I'm a freak about getting into the
water and I know what the tide is doing at
[SPEAKER_02]: all points in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the moon cycle means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, it's, it's a real,
uh, important thing to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we jump into some fishing stuff,
which we are going to get to just got to
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly ask you are notorious for having
these, you know, 20 plus year old seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're able to get to germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of your little tips and
tricks for getting these bad boys to
[SPEAKER_01]: hatch?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what it all, uh, it just was a
matter of luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first started putting up seeds,
we had no idea when we were going to use
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagined a year or two years and,
uh, I used 35 millimeter film containers,
[SPEAKER_02]: which turned out to be airproof and
waterproof.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd put a little bit of a decanter,
which at the time people would say and put
[SPEAKER_02]: in rice or a small wadded up piece of,
uh, like a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just opted for a small piece of paper
towel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would generally even write the
genetics right on the paper towel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would be labeled inside,
maybe labeled on the outside in a black
[SPEAKER_02]: permanent marker, but one or two years,
I, I never used them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, I am not one for
change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've worked the same job since 87.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had the same house, the same,
I raised American bulldogs and I've bred
[SPEAKER_02]: them since late eighties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never changed anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I like to just like keep it all the
same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I have changed a little bit,
but it's easy to get 30 year old genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just put them in the freezer and 30
years goes by and it, uh, tends to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you don't thaw, thaw them out,
you're going to retain all the
[SPEAKER_02]: germination, uh, properties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might lose 10% germination if I thaw
them out, but I never have to thaw them
[SPEAKER_02]: out because when I dig through them,
uh, for one thing, I have a commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: freezer and I can almost stand in the son
of a bitch and key it's 20 below.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can, uh, you know, I can get in there
and pick shit out without thawing it
[SPEAKER_02]: middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the middle of winter, we got,
we have seven, eight months to where you
[SPEAKER_02]: can just straight up grab your collection
and start digging through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It never does thaw.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people that I've sent, uh, you know,
good old seeds to mean gene and just a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of them, they just, they're like
instantly going, well, how old did you say
[SPEAKER_02]: they were?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I have a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's better than what I just produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, well, they, it just
happened to all fall together.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were healthy ass, good seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, people didn't know the timeframe
on frozen seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people assume 20 years on marijuana
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've heard 30 is the window,
but it's way, way, way longer than 30
[SPEAKER_02]: years because I have 100% germination at
30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it is, uh, it's something right
there that needs to be explored.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, exciting too, because if you
think about it, um, the Joe Rom cuts alive
[SPEAKER_02]: at 50 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you're shortly 20 more years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have 50 year old seeds that
just have never been cracked and still
[SPEAKER_02]: ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's the real treasure trove.
[SPEAKER_01]: There.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess my final kind of question about
Alaska in general is overall, would you
[SPEAKER_01]: consider it a good environment to be
growing indoors, given that it's got that
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice cold temperatures,
or do you think it just kind of comes with
[SPEAKER_01]: its own challenges?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're a lot more advantageous.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're lucky, I should say, um,
uh, because you're fighting heat and
[SPEAKER_02]: every, every, uh, every place in America,
but here, um, it gets real hot in the
[SPEAKER_02]: interior here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll get to 90 and you're fighting heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: There, but, uh, I know people that grow in
Texas, it's, it's a pig, uh, the law
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement's going to stand on your head
and treat it like you're a meth head and
[SPEAKER_02]: the fucking heat you're going to fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just no way you could be
comfortable in a grill room in Texas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, if you were cool on it,
you're going to run a fortune in moving
[SPEAKER_02]: air or a cool in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have really good ambient air
temperature most of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, we're able to run a little bit
hotter lights and just run you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: run a air box and, uh, bring in a little
bit of fresh, cool air, which is generally
[SPEAKER_02]: our summer air might be 60 degrees to
where you can swap out your summer air and
[SPEAKER_02]: keep a grow room without any big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it at about 75.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as an advantage to growing up here,
we also never had the, uh, I'd say till
[SPEAKER_02]: two years ago, we never had powder mildew
in Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never, ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever.
Never.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were isolated, but now, you know,
with modern day people trucking clones
[SPEAKER_02]: back and forth from PM Fest, uh,
it's, it's, uh, it's common that now we're
[SPEAKER_02]: all infiltrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now I imagine next will be the dudding
disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you hear about, uh, dark horse
nursery?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just found a cure, uh, viral, a viroid
that is, uh, the name of the buddy,
[SPEAKER_02]: the dudding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is figured out and it's a hops disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that it was, and, uh,
they actually know how to eradicate it
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's tests for it and, uh,
people with all that dudding or,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, there's a couple other names that they
call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're figuring that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right about the time that shit hits
here, we'll actually have a cure for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that post.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think what they were trying to say
was that it's some, you know, specified
[SPEAKER_01]: way of doing essentially Ameristem
culture, which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, having spoken to a few
people, a few guys have got dotted clones
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're still hanging onto because
they're so old, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the original Calio and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to, just to sidestep that point for
one sec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Overall, what do you think is the most
important factor in a grow out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: three possibilities, genetics,
environment, or the growers skill?
[SPEAKER_02]: The environment is, uh, you know,
you can make shitty genetics shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your environment is perfect and it
doesn't take much skill to, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to have perfect genetics for
sure, because you could have the best
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics, but what if you just stick it in
the shit whole environment and then
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's gone and you could still just
like being, uh, you know, an idiot and
[SPEAKER_02]: grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, um, that's one of the
advantages of growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is that it's resilient and it
gives you hundreds of breaks, lets you
[SPEAKER_02]: like live a very complacent life and you
don't even realize how much it's given
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to kind of loop back to your
breeding for a moment, the topic of
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds has certainly come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you're looking to
explore more and which of the various
[SPEAKER_01]: feminization methods would you want to
pursue out of like the colloidal silver,
[SPEAKER_01]: the STS or like the gibberellic acid?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool that you brought that up too,
because in, uh, in 88, we, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was growing tomatoes and at the time we
had Waco and, uh, we, I was growing the
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes and the cannabis together and I
was trying to get the tomato blossoms to
[SPEAKER_02]: set.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the tomato sets is just a,
um, gibberellic acid, just straight up
[SPEAKER_02]: hormone they sell us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called some, um, set spray or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I sprayed that shit all over my
tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more blossoms hit the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tomatoes stretched, you know,
three feet and the spray got onto a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of, uh, Jamaican plants of all things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was growing them in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking Jamaican gets, uh, gets
gibberellic acid on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the thing goes to a vine and,
uh, I thought it was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: The leaf structure and turned the stems
red, like, uh, like, um, zero,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, like a magnesium deficiency and,
uh, no phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, how wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started spraying it on everything and
my Waco plants, uh, reversed and we made a
[SPEAKER_02]: big batch of seeds and we grew out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We thought it was the coolest thing in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we knew at that point in time,
you could find out a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Ed Rosenthal had some shit about,
uh, feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, nothing about chemically induced
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always about just natural,
uh, you know, late season flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the thing's trying to save its own
life and then generally come from
[SPEAKER_02]: equatorial varieties, which at the time,
that's what a lot of our genetics were at
[SPEAKER_02]: over 50%, 75% had Thai or Colombian or
Burmese or any of the equatorial,
[SPEAKER_02]: even Africans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and those things will always throw
that late season banana to save their own
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that's what I knew as to be
female seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I saw these and figured it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were all females and, uh,
you know, it didn't reverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't feminize as good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not as good, I should say,
as the mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while it was all female, we didn't see
a value in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we never looked back from 88 on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never looked back period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, you know, five, 10 years,
about five years ago that, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized movement just crazily took off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I just watched and watched,
well, man, these guys are fucking up
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know that, um, unless everything's
tracked, you can't generally breed to any
[SPEAKER_02]: of this stuff past S one you're screwed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I realized that it was watering
down everything badly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really want to get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of followed people doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, recently I did grab some STS
spray, sprayed a Durbin down and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: going to just do a Durbin female,
uh, reversal or make Durbin feminize.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just, just for the shits and grins,
I guess, but it took five weeks for the,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, pollen to actually come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just feminized a lemon tree and an
orange tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 17 high times, San Bernardino Sativa
winner was the orange tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nobody disputes the lemon tree as
being like over the top lemon skunk with
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know, the fricking sour diesel
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's one of the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just figured it'd be like cool with
the turps of the Durbin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mixed in with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I did mess with it, but you know,
I don't put too much value in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The seeds are sitting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought about cracking them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd give them to anybody or something that
somebody wanted to play with it because
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, uh, I'm not thinking it's helping
the, the genetics at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So touching on that topic, how important
is it in your mind for a breeder to give
[SPEAKER_01]: away seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess specifically when they're kind
of starting out, do you feel like that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: part of paying your dues?
[SPEAKER_01]: As an extension of that idea, what would
be your advice for someone who's just
[SPEAKER_01]: starting out, wants to kind of get a bit
more established in terms of a breeder?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say do their homework and get,
um, a line or, or, or collect genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: that can be advanced and can go somewhere,
not just another, uh, another poly hybrid
[SPEAKER_02]: that is multi-generational poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, uh, they're actually at a point
of a bottleneck so tight right now with 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years of that going on that, uh,
a new breeder should gear up and try to
[SPEAKER_02]: select something that is unique and
different if it can be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, if not, you're just jumping on
the bandwagon with everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be left in the dusk and
it's been done 10,000 times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as kind of a final thought to wrap
this topic up, what's your thoughts on the
[SPEAKER_01]: exponential rise in breeders we see
collectively within the community?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has the right to breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, if everybody had the same goals,
it would be, uh, it'd be a huge advantage,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, um, that's never going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, we are humans and we are all like,
um, on our own path.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see it going, uh, you know,
between corporate and, uh, maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: trademarking and, uh, that the way it
could go that direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather see independent people doing it
and just everybody do it at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what type of breeders would you like to
work with going forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the guys that I work with right now,
librarians that, um, they paid their dues
[SPEAKER_02]: and they were there at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and, uh, they put in their,
you know, 100% to get us where we are
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's people that I value the most old
heads and people that, uh, saw the value,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 50 years ago and then all the
people with heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I don't, I don't need to,
uh, I worked for a living and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I could retire anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a shit, uh, about trying to
make a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I've worked a steady day job.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that old saying, don't quit your
day job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm fucking awkward.
[SPEAKER_02]: August of, uh, August of this year is like
34 years working down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I've always had a different view
than everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are growing and selling their buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never sold my buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might sell them off to cover a light
bill, but I grew for myself and only to
[SPEAKER_02]: further my genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was my only mindset for 30 and 35
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I don't think the same way
everybody else thinks, but I'd go with
[SPEAKER_02]: anybody with heart mean gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirk farmer, um, dynasty Mephisto's.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all people that are like,
they got your back and, uh, there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: shitload of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Way too many to mention.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, I would hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be a total ass if I didn't just come
up with 20 of them right now, because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all like, I want to work with
every one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they're just good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always one of those things where you
don't want to leave anyone out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but something I do want to greatly echo.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sentiment you just expressed is
especially in Australia, please guys have
[SPEAKER_01]: a day job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it don't make this your
full-time gig because frankly,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to have to compromise things
to make money instead of following the
[SPEAKER_01]: passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where the best results
come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're pursuing passion and not
necessity based things, but to get back on
[SPEAKER_01]: track, I wanted to quickly ask you what
land race is your favorite and do you have
[SPEAKER_01]: any plans to work with it going forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have to say tie because it's that,
it's just that one crazy ass good memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I know the potential that's there
and I'm at a point where I've been offered
[SPEAKER_02]: so many things and I've passed up on
opportunities I should have took up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do have a shitload of, um,
you know, good land race and, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely need to dig into a bunch of it,
but I would say tie is what I would try.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried really cool things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might dig, I've got some 77 Himalayan
that single stocked sativa and it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, one of the few single stocks that I've
been able to come across except NL one and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a sativa too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing that I think is pretty
unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and, uh, I like to, I like those
unique, uh, genetics, uh, straight Fox
[SPEAKER_02]: made up some, uh, he was black AFI,
I think which, which was Bodys and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, uh, Iraqi Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I grew that out, it was all like
13 finger fan leafs with single stock
[SPEAKER_02]: growth and super dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the things that I want to
work with right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally speaking, would you consider
yourself more of an Indica or a sativa
[SPEAKER_01]: guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd probably say 50 50 because I
like knock down, drag out Indica's,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're not going to let you get
anything done.
[SPEAKER_02]: You better have a fucking couch to nap on
or a four shot espresso.
[SPEAKER_02]: Waiting after you smoke some Mac,
you know, cause, uh, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be doing a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You spoke some chocolate or my,
uh, tropical that, that, uh, space Jill
[SPEAKER_02]: and chocolate, some things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were way ripping ass high and still
get everything done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe, uh, sing a little bit and
groove to the music a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, uh, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, um, the Mac, you know, it,
it, it's interesting cause Mac's not only
[SPEAKER_01]: like the flavor of the month, but you
know, there's that kind of story of,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not really a story, but there's the
incidence of you not only collecting like
[SPEAKER_01]: a really impressive amount of pollen,
but you know, you kind of sent it out far
[SPEAKER_01]: and far and wide, which in my opinion,
really quite noble and our buddy
[SPEAKER_01]: organically enhanced here in Australia,
even he managed to make some crosses with
[SPEAKER_01]: that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess my question is what made you
decide to share it because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's such high demand and, um,
you know, the explosive popularity of cap
[SPEAKER_01]: is, you know, just, you can't even deny it
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your thoughts on the Mac and why
did you decide to share the pollen with
[SPEAKER_01]: people?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You brought that up for a couple of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that because I had already been in
contact with Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I wasn't going to buy no,
I mean, it's, I've never been in a rec
[SPEAKER_02]: store.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll kind of go down this road.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been in a rec store up here or
in any other place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I have bought seeds like I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought, you know, the platinum
huckleberry from a seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I bought, I might've bought a
dozen packs of seeds, but I've been given
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe a thousand packs of seeds from the
best breeders in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the top of their line or it's the
best dash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that right there was like so
heartfelt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, when I seen how cap was given that
away and it already run for a year and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half, fuck and talk about year of the Mac,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I was kind of like a little bit
spiteful and I was like, uh, I got it
[SPEAKER_02]: given to me and I figured I'd breed with
it and offer any extra.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I ended up, you know, putting a shout
out to locals only.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up getting hit up by everybody
in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent that to Thailand, India,
Australia, Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think nine, uh, eight or nine
countries I sent that to and then sent it
[SPEAKER_02]: to a dozen places in America because I had
like 20 grams of the, of the pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was crazy wanting to dump pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I figured I was being a wise ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put a post up said, um, end of the year
of the Mac or something, just giving it
[SPEAKER_02]: out and people are going, there always has
to be that one guy that has to ruin
[SPEAKER_02]: everything good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you know, if you ain't had
your run with Mac at this point,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck, I mean, it's for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody can get it for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the main cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought, cause everybody was going,
man, I'll never ever get in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get on his list and you have
to wait and wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're lucky enough to ever get it or
get in line at an event that he might
[SPEAKER_02]: release something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just go, I'll never ever see it
in our lifetime over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd love to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not the guy that would help out
those people, you're a dick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and should, I think I lost my ass
sending that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 30, 40 bucks a pack to send
international, even if it's pollen,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but whether I got love back or
not, I, uh, I figured I helped them people
[SPEAKER_02]: out unless it was like going to India and
getting bread to, you know, land ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they, they promised me they're keeping
it for their own personal, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: collection because they can never get
their hands on the Mac.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly one of those very sought
after ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said though, you know,
we see things like the GMO having run its
[SPEAKER_01]: course and the Skittles and even Mac
appears to be kind of reaching the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your prediction for the newest
flavor of the Mac?
[SPEAKER_01]: The month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And would you ever try to kind of get
ahead of the curb and cash in on the
[SPEAKER_01]: correct prediction?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't think I care to ever
chase a dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would, uh, I'd rather go fishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I, I think what the next biggest
thing is, is going to be exotics flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some of the spice Island type of
flavors, man, if we could ever get a
[SPEAKER_02]: cinnamon girl back or some of the
Polynesian flavors, there's some really
[SPEAKER_02]: good spicy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutmeg flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, another one I would be nuts about
and, uh, passion fruits and, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawaiian exotic fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do believe there's going to be a
huge reassurgence of blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, orange is so roadkill run over and
burnt out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people still dig the turf,
but, uh, you know, it was orange and then
[SPEAKER_02]: it was lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I still really dig the lemon tree
something fierce.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm growing like lemon ice pucker and it's
like a quarter of the good.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, uh, the lemon tree is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've heard the lemon Royale from
swamp boys is like off the hook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm super tempted to, uh, you know,
check that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I would love to get ahead of
the game and the curve and produce passion
[SPEAKER_02]: fruit or any of the guava, something
that's new and exotic, not just the,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, flipping cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a hundred cookie crosses and you
taste the cookie and every one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so fucking blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was turning people on that never
seen it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go, is that the same as that
other one that we just tried?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, well, it's half the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next would be the same
answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's half the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cause I had like a whole jar after
jar of, uh, cookie crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, that's nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want some flavors back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I've never had a ton of sours,
but I do like some sours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Barnes, who, uh, he's the front man
for six feet under.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you, you know who that is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's, uh, he's like a extremely cool cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he is extreme in, uh, in his music
lifestyle and persona and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he's the most humble and, and,
uh, good guy in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grows this killer, uh, blueberry
headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: He calls it B H B six, six, six,
which is, um, beyond hell bound six,
[SPEAKER_02]: six, six.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent him my best, uh, nine percent,
uh, tested at the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunk cabbage pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he knocked his six, six, six up and
made the seven, seven, seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I guess that's also symbol for
heaven and hell, which I don't follow any
[SPEAKER_02]: of that mystical shit or know about it so
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, me and Chris Barnes are friends
and now his blueberry headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a killer power and, uh, it's like
27%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, uh, got lots of color.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to get into some, uh,
sours and, uh, mixed Turks too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to have a front of one flavor and
heavy back of another, but I think all we
[SPEAKER_02]: should have equal alpha and beta terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you cannot produce this quit growing
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely that diversity within terpenes
is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you said the golden words in the
midst of a description.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said, uh, orange has been ran over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the roadkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to ask about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any experiences with the
roadkill skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we didn't ever call it roadkill,
but we had a shitload of skunk because we
[SPEAKER_02]: bought, you know, big skunk from,
uh, from sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was half real skunk and whether some
were sweet phenos, there was still a
[SPEAKER_02]: quarter of them were skunk phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in 91, we bought the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So super skunk to me to this day is still
the, um, the only plant I think you can go
[SPEAKER_02]: back to that has the old, what people call
roadkill skunk, but true skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I call it true skunk, but yes,
I have old genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy as shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: How I might have old genetics,
but I've got original, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, super dank cast true skunks,
uh, super skunk male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to try to get together with,
with people like, I think farmer Joe four
[SPEAKER_02]: 20, I think is on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, he has, he has an 87 super skunk and
he has males, but you know, I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: known for my males.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, we're going to try to bring out
more skunk, but I got a half a dozen
[SPEAKER_02]: skunks that are, I've got a big skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the super skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a Matt Niska BX that's true
skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got an old hawk and big skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all males, which is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you can rub the mail at any time and
get that true skunk hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have my wife smell it and she
either hits me with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's, she's like very put off by it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or she just says, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very strong marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point I hit it right on the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that point it's like, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give her a kiss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like rally off to my happy point
and do a dance, you know, above scoring
[SPEAKER_02]: the shit that will turn her nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a great description.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we're kind of on the skunk topic,
tell us a little bit about your skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: cabbage or crabbage, however you want to
pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's cabbage, but everybody in the
world is going to call it crabbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just let them, let them be,
you know, whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just crazy training chocoloat,
but it's off the hook.
[SPEAKER_02]: It puts what it's like, if you were to
breed the 91 white and it puts white on
[SPEAKER_02]: anything, this fucker will put white on
anything, but it, it has really rotten.
[SPEAKER_02]: Skunky turps plus, cause there's a plant
called skunk cabbage that's up here real
[SPEAKER_02]: prevalent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the first thing that grows in the
summer and it produces its own heat,
[SPEAKER_02]: melts the snowbank around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the bears come along and then the
deer and the bear, we have, we have like
[SPEAKER_02]: implanted deer that have made it up here
since it's been 90 years or 80 years
[SPEAKER_02]: they've been up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first thing they can find to eat is
that skunk cabbage, but it melts its own
[SPEAKER_02]: way out of a snowbank from producing its
own fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we, you know, kind of put that
together, the fire side of it and the
[SPEAKER_02]: rankness of it, people actually smell
skunk cabbage and have come back and told
[SPEAKER_02]: me, is that how you name that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, that is half of why I named
it that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that Tom Hill had a skunk
cabbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just embarrassing for me to,
you know, call it that for years and then
[SPEAKER_02]: find out I seem like bean hoarder or
something that has like all these Tom Hill
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, Oh, skunk cabbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an idiot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's why I changed it with the cube
because it was out of crazy train from the
[SPEAKER_02]: TGA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've separated it that way,
but it's my go-to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get stoned.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I'm smoking 15%, this sat in
the other all day long and I can take
[SPEAKER_02]: three hits of that and it'll override all
15 joints of the 15%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, it's probably my, my cannibinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: My endocannibinoid system is probably just
geared up for that turf cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did have the high highest in state
terp test ever about three or four years
[SPEAKER_02]: ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also I was told in Canada at the
biggest lab up there, it's hit the third
[SPEAKER_02]: highest terpene cont terpene numbers on
the biggest lab up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, saying that doesn't make a
lot of sense because Canada is five or six
[SPEAKER_02]: or seven provinces and fucking 1 million
labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I was told by somebody,
it hit top three out of the biggest lab up
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got some funk to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of just dig it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that I probably won't ever
go without.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've sent it to people like a bunch of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave it to Bodie and I think Stray and
Doc and might've give it to me and Gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I gave it to pharmacy factory and I
give it to ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if you like it or hate it or
whatever, throw it away, grow it,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't matter, but it hits me just right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like that one, which is hopefully
violent with more people than just you.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that being said, what's your favorite
strain that often maybe gets a bit of hate
[SPEAKER_01]: or just doesn't get as much love from
other people?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know because the ones that
everybody, you know, you get slapped in
[SPEAKER_02]: the face or a lot of memes and shit about
AJ Sour Diesel and a lot of memes and
[SPEAKER_02]: backhands from the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never smoked any of the real shit,
so I have no idea what's good and people
[SPEAKER_02]: call bad or give a bad rap to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of only smoke my own flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been to that wreck thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, they have like gummy
bears up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody smoked that with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a 31% local thing at the wreck market
and somebody's growing it in their home
[SPEAKER_02]: deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy that gave it to the wreck or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just thought it was such poor weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a picky ass Dick and I like my own
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it sounds like a man after my own
heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can certainly relate to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you like to make your
concentrate a little bit of Keith on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of the bong hit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you a more of like a BHL and
concentrates type of guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, near zero, uh, concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make a lot of Keith a shit load because
well, I might like even on the TK and L5
[SPEAKER_02]: this last run that I seeded out 16,
16 or 17 different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every bit of it went to that pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: No flower at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all I had was, uh, you know,
Keith, after I have de-shocked it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can separate the Keith.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the only thing I do with it is
just put it on a rosin press.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, low, low, uh, heat rosin at about,
uh, 65 Celsius, which is, I think one 60
[SPEAKER_02]: or something on Fahrenheit and,
uh, just press it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have, I have, uh, I don't smoke a
shit load of concentrates and never ever
[SPEAKER_02]: really ever smoked BHL smoke, some EHL and
people up here kind of tag me for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people go, I know you, I've heard you
don't do no BHL or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll come and bring me a sample,
which is real full by hardly ever would
[SPEAKER_02]: ever smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And EHL tends to be better, but,
uh, I have about a half a pound of rosin
[SPEAKER_02]: at all points in time, just because I
squish all of the Keith.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very common to get eight ounce jars
of Keith or two at a time, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then what are you going to do with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You either had to make EHL, BHL or some
rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, rosin is white spectrum and a
little bit better, way better high,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of where the market's heading
towards the end of last year, we saw the
[SPEAKER_01]: rise of the, uh, the very controversial
$100 eights from Big Al.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you feel like this affects the
market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like there's a place within
the market for the ultra premium products
[SPEAKER_01]: and the, the high end consumers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you feel like the fact that cannabis
has this medicinal component to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we shouldn't allow things to creep up
like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see both sides of that, uh,
that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people that want to feel special
and actually have, you know, liquid
[SPEAKER_02]: assets.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dumb bulldogs are going to go off,
but, um, I don't think it's certainly not
[SPEAKER_02]: good for the normal guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's unfair for the, uh,
the grower because they're getting
[SPEAKER_02]: hammered on the low end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like rubbing it in their
face.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you can get a hundred dollars
for an eighth and, and you're paying 500
[SPEAKER_02]: for a pound, it's not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it puts an interesting spin on like,
what does the grower get out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, Big Al to his credit used to
be a grower, but I believe for the most
[SPEAKER_01]: part now he's actually a more of a kind of
like a middleman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a, you know, there's a
situation for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we're so diverse as humans,
there's a, there's people in the world
[SPEAKER_02]: would never consider, they never consider,
um, you know, first world problems like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you look at the whole scheme of
things, everybody has a right to do what
[SPEAKER_02]: they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there's somebody that there's an,
if there's a need, build a void.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, as much as I may have some personal
questions about the situation,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, my mind immediately always wanders
to the fact that, you know, there are
[SPEAKER_01]: people who pay hundreds of thousand
dollars for cars and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people don't criticize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I feel like there's gotta be some,
uh, congruency and consistency within,
[SPEAKER_01]: within our thought process, at least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you won't see anybody giving somebody
grief over that car.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to give them a hundred
percent of congratulations that they made
[SPEAKER_02]: it to that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not, not even be butthurt over it or
jealous, unless it's your hard work from
[SPEAKER_02]: your brow sweat that, uh, got that car for
your boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's maybe a whole nother
conversation in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one last thing I wanted to bring up
before we jump onto some fishing stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause we're going to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: After this one, I noticed on your feed,
you got some dungeon vault genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of Eric and dungeon vault
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you most looking forward to
popping out of those seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you have any experience with brandy
wine or more specifically the pink
[SPEAKER_01]: champagne, which is the mother of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Another really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're nailing it because, um,
I had not known him too long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I met him through the catalogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I sent him catalogs because I think his
genetics stood up for themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear anybody, um, except maybe
some controversy, you know, everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna, whatever your background is,
or somebody always butthurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, I knew through Falconer that,
um, he had some stand up shit and he
[SPEAKER_02]: straight up sent me like maybe a couple
packs of a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I, um, I know that the humble pie
was going to be real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I had no, this is how backwards
and are like so old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know that grandpa's breath was
granddaddy purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to listen to your interview with him
to find out the history of dungeon vault
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd already met him and talked to him
and, um, he's given me his genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no idea what it was because I don't
follow if there's something that I,
[SPEAKER_02]: I am not going to have a route,
a planned route, you know, to go down
[SPEAKER_02]: myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't absorb that shit at this point in
my life, a very little room left in my
[SPEAKER_02]: brain for new information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not going to absorb all,
um, knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of keep it within,
uh, right in my view.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, he's a good guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's, um, uh, really good
thing that he's got going on and keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: it straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a couple of my testers have grown
this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought me the smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did just recently send him, um,
multiple TKL five, uh, the F two of the
[SPEAKER_02]: TKL five Hayes, the, uh, my best purple to
the TKL five Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I want him to experience,
you know, another 100% view of purple and
[SPEAKER_02]: then get his dick just knocked straight
into the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's, it's, it's, um, something
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going to beat a horse on the
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, if you fucking buy it and trust
me, you have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't, then it's a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting to some of the more
lighthearted stuff I've been promising for
[SPEAKER_01]: a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about fishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you do a lot of fishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've even seen a few, the odd photos of
maybe hunting here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does cannabis interact with these
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like to do them while sober or is
it just like the perfect time to get high
[SPEAKER_01]: for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a total weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, I can tell you the days that I
didn't get high, um, to tell you the truth
[SPEAKER_02]: in 1985 from Monday, the first to Friday,
the fifth, I did not get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit smoking pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like a teenager.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was fed up with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, my brother or my good,
good friend, my friend's brother comes
[SPEAKER_02]: back from the peace corps with them on
Friday night.
[SPEAKER_02]: He comes back Thursday night and,
uh, gives him some tie bud from whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: country he was in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fucker calls me up Friday,
tells me he's got this tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like, okay, I'm on my way over a
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was right back to smoke and I quit for
five days and 85.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, there was another time I flew in
and, uh, we're moose hunting and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, and, uh, 98.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, as I see the plane take off,
I'm getting ready to roll our celebratory
[SPEAKER_02]: joint and I'm digging around and there's
no fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left, you know, a week's worth of weed
and it's like, holy shit, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be a whole week going to be
over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be the two times in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ain't smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get, I did get, I can't say that
too, cause I almost died once.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, you know, 106 and a half
fever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, uh, something, it was a,
uh, staff infection on my epiglottis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little flap in the back of your
throat, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It, uh, it's 30%, uh, survivability rate
if you get this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I waited until the last minute,
like, like I normally would.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I went in almost dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd already passed out and I woke back up
alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went to the hospital and they
innovated me and put me on, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: anesthesia for like four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was another four days I didn't
smoke weed, but I have no choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what type of fishing and hunting do
you like to do most?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, I like to hunt just about
everything, but our, our opportunities are
[SPEAKER_02]: limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: We try to fill our freezer on the moose
and deer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we hunt, uh, I don't do a lot of bird
hunting because it's not as a much
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had a lot of upland game bird,
I'd do that a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only have like a couple.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a grouse and a spruce hen and I'll
do that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love bird hunting, but, uh, we deer hunt
moose hunt a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: A bird hunt, but fishing, we just get
whatever comes up as soon as we can get
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have been, uh, like I mentioned
earlier, I would have be out right now
[SPEAKER_02]: getting crab because, uh, federal crabbing
for subsistence crabbing goes from October
[SPEAKER_02]: 15th to, uh, March 31st.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they let us just, as soon as the
weather has freezing sprain, you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to die trying to get this substance,
uh, your, your subsistence crab.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the weather just won't let you get
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now there's a little bit of a
break the last three weeks, but a storm
[SPEAKER_02]: came through just now and it's 10 foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ocean was snow and, and we'd be out
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause my partner went out last weekend and
caught a 15 pound king crab.
[SPEAKER_02]: He caught a bunch of little ones,
but he caught a 15 pound king crab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that, that is where you want to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the other thing I noticed from your
feed is that, you know, you appear to have
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of a sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell me what's your favorite candy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a kind of a dessert kind of guy and
sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but jelly, uh, good,
good gummies, uh, from European countries
[SPEAKER_02]: tend to be very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have a lot of, um, they have no
corn syrup.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have any preservatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all gummies from every country I've
ever had minus like America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fresh gummies are a big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go from place to place and there's
like, you know, shops that are
[SPEAKER_02]: specializing in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've had my friend, Jolly glass send me
back, uh, you know, ton of stuff from span
[SPEAKER_02]: of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had a couple of friends that
hooked me up like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but I, I, I got a sweet tooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got that right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only here once.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, better take advantage of whatever
you're given.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so does that extend into edibles or
purely just a, you know, a sober
[SPEAKER_01]: confectionary type of deal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Edibles hit me like a ton of bricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I'm big time into edibles cause I
love good edibles, but I generally would
[SPEAKER_02]: make like, uh, virgin coconut oil and,
um, maybe one jar of virgin coconut oil,
[SPEAKER_02]: a big size jar and a half a pound of like,
uh, XJ 13 Pennywise is a nine to 12% CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would take all that flower and put
it in, uh, you know, hydrate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't get no chlorophyll after it's
dried.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rehydrate it and then just melt off
all the Keith and make some real good can
[SPEAKER_02]: of coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, my other biggest thing is
our, we Barry pick in Prince Williams town
[SPEAKER_02]: where I fish a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are, there's a, there's a lot of
berries, cloud berries, um, there's black
berries.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another type of a black current
and there's blueberry and there's salmon
[SPEAKER_02]: berry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can end it in my yard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It generally, I have a lot of berry
bushes, so I will pick about 50 pounds of
[SPEAKER_02]: wild berry every year and freeze it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes more than 50 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might get, I might get, um, sometimes
way more buckets and buckets of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'll make a natural wild berry syrup
and put my rosin from all of the rosin
[SPEAKER_02]: that I make from kefir and just make a
wide spectrum of natural wild berry syrup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm kind of famous for it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do like that as an edible,
but I would promote, uh, anybody that
[SPEAKER_02]: wants edible green goddess, uh,
delights is the best edible producer that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've come across.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's a friend of mine and she makes
gummies that wicked cherry gummies,
[SPEAKER_02]: wicked, uh, green apple or wicked
watermelon, wicked pineapple, or they
[SPEAKER_02]: have, uh, you know, jolly ropes.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won the, the, uh, mid, uh,
the east, the new England high times cup
[SPEAKER_02]: last year with their blue raspberry funk
juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're famous for their funk juice
and, uh, their products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday I had a friend come by and said,
he doesn't get high on edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And man, I instantly broke out a 500
milligram bottle of the funk juice and
[SPEAKER_02]: said, try this tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to meet a 200 milligram jolly rope.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we split a package of the wicked,
uh, wicked watermelon, uh, gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they taste so good as a candy that
you're not going to stop eating them.
[SPEAKER_02]: My boss is 60 almost 70 year old Korean
and a fucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'll start eating them and then,
uh, could it taste like candy?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, be hammered shortly
after, even though, uh, they're only a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred milligram packages.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they're, they're, they're,
they've got it down just right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've probably never had a better edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no question.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred milligrams would definitely put
my dick in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question though, out of all the meat
you hunt or just everything in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's your favorite food?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I love halibut, but I, uh,
there is really no favorite food because
[SPEAKER_02]: we get all unlimited amount of spot shrimp
like every Friday night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, that's a pretty, pretty premium
thing, no matter where you're at cold
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shrimp is probably one of the best things
in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, good fish, but good moose meat or
a goat of a mountain goat, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff is the mildest, best tasting
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They live on cliffs and you wouldn't think
that they'd be edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause a barnyard Billy goat tastes like
grass and piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's harsh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things got a big ass, nasty set of
balls on them and they're super mature.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're solid muscle, but it's like fork
tender.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mildest meat in the world, milder than
veal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, shit that, that stuff besides
this, it's impossible to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you put all that together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say, um, mountain goat, doll sheep
might be next to, you've got to climb
[SPEAKER_02]: five, 6,000 feet and, uh, they can see for
miles, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just not going to get one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you do one of the best flavored
animals in the world, uh, of anything I've
[SPEAKER_02]: ever had and, uh, the, uh, accomplishment
of it makes it taste even twice that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goat curry is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to move on to our next subject,
many people, and you've mentioned it a few
[SPEAKER_01]: times, probably familiar with you as being
the guy with the old school seed magazine
[SPEAKER_01]: collections.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how did this collection initially
begin?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that Bodhi's mentioned in the past,
he's traded you some magazines and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly grateful to have a few copies
from you, but how did this all originate?
[SPEAKER_02]: It just started because we were buying
seeds from the sensei seed bank and SSSC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had my original catalogs from 89,
90 and 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 30 years later, I didn't really look
at them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, when I finally did look at them,
I was just going, Holy shit, they're in
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect shape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like reliving glory days really
hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, Oh my God, I, every feeling you
ever had came back.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the sending off your 60 bucks and
wait in three months and paranoia like
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy, like, like we're all going to go to
prison over this damn package of seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're all pulling on our money together.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not one of us had enough money
to actually buy seeds back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funnier than shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I saved them and realized how,
how cool it was, uh, I kind of just looked
[SPEAKER_02]: for more and, um, saw that Bodhi had a
bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: His friend was a photographer for the 85
catalog and he had a dozen uncirculated,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, copies.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gives me a brand new uncirculated copy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, man, that guy, I mean,
what can you say about him?
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, he'll go out of his way to make
you happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and it's like the coolest guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bombed his collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's that good of a guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like, don't know him, don't know
him at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like, I'd love to copy him.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could trust me with them,
send them to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he went over to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when he went down to Mexico with
strand off and he is, he sent his wife to
[SPEAKER_02]: the post to send them to me after he left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she, sure enough, she, she,
I got him in the mail, was able to copy
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave them back to him at Emerald in
17 and, um, you know, thanked him a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's such a valuable history,
uh, sitting in your hands and you can just
[SPEAKER_02]: cater, it's all categorized and you can
just look it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the information that's in there is
still viable today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing I get more of a kick out
of than going back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking at some of the strains and being
like, ah, this is the exact stock scale
[SPEAKER_01]: you came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, their technical information on
growing was immense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, um, at least the SSSEs,
uh, they have a mini book in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get more technical than I ever wanted
to for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, huge shout out to Steve
and Olivia.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're two amazing people who everyone in
the community loves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next one I wanted to ask you about,
what do you feel is the future for the
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Cup?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we expect to see you there this
December or are you considering going
[SPEAKER_01]: elsewhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: The general sentiment last year is that
things felt a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Things felt a lot different from the first
Emerald Cup and they're a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_02]: different than the original Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, you know, it's evolved and,
um, I and Alaska in general, we had our
[SPEAKER_02]: very first time ever real event,
which was a high time step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up here this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like no public display of
cannabis, no smoking of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: no nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was so shitty and harsh that it was
like the biggest turnoff in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my view, Emerald was 100% success,
even though it wasn't the same as it was
[SPEAKER_02]: in prior years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the feeling is still right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as people are still able to
relay their message, which I did see a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of that, you know, we were right there in
that circle of love the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you still can be right there with
the people that really mean something in
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry and in doing right for the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that sense, Emerald was successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did people make as much money?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Dungeon Vault, his dad died that
morning, that Saturday morning,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he held a booth there and $10,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: He didn't want to just piss it away or he
would have just walked away from the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he said he covered his bases.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said it was worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's an opinion right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I feel a little bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eric, if you listen to this, I had no
idea, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spoke to you that day and I feel bad for
not saying anything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you know, you hit it on the
head, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember you were kind of out front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the booth I was at, there was an
awesome little crew there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was you, Bob Hemphill,
Skunk VA, Duke, just every name you could
[SPEAKER_01]: think of, just kind of congregate and have
little chats out the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of surreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just sit there and to just be like,
this is, this is it right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the little circle you want to be
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It truly was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt, um, I felt honored to be able to
stand there with every one of those guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: including you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, to me, I think it's still about,
um, community and, um, everybody that was
[SPEAKER_02]: there, that that's the sentiment 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not one of those guys that didn't
have each other's back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as well as having the communities
back, which is the big part, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: which linked us all.
[SPEAKER_02]: That too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, um, it's a different world,
boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 10 and 15 and 20 years,
every single plot, everything that's gone
[SPEAKER_02]: by, it's been just a crazy world to wear
out as much as separation as it is right
[SPEAKER_02]: now with, uh, you know, people trying to
get greedy and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just as much, uh, ties being made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it made the community a lot
stronger and it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting towards our little quick fire
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last question or two before those,
though, I wanted to quickly ask,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's your feeling about the rise of the
vape pen?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you've seen the South Park
episode mocking is pretty funny,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, essentially, how do you feel they
affect the community in the sense that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're, they're trying to bridge the gap
between like casual consumer and the
[SPEAKER_01]: general market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel though they're having more of
a detrimental effect than a beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: effect overall?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a way to bridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, complete different,
um, generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's good things about them and bad
things about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny that they got names like,
you know, pussy stick and douche flute and
[SPEAKER_02]: the people that, um, it's a different
generation that tends to use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a convenient type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't say I haven't used them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my buddy Falconer bought one of the
cookie pens, which was, uh, I guess we're
[SPEAKER_02]: fillable only locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had it engraved with his name and
just tossed to some bitch when it ran out,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, it was a very good product I
thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I don't see it being a horrible
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm so neutral about everything,
but, um, there's good things in it and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's bad things in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the heavy metals,
cheap ass Chinese, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: materials being made and, uh, untested
shitty products being put into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is where I have problems with the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you feel about the kind of the
introduction of the non-cannabis derived
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes to these concentrates or even the
reintroduction of them after they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: separated out?
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a big fan of cannabis terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you put them back in, do them,
uh, you know, as a aromatherapy or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, but I'm not a fan of vegetable
and fruit derived turps being added to
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, uh, you can get real like
terpenes for flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And add it to your brewing supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a whole different thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a hundreds of terpenes that are
just straight up natural, 100% natural
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, just in liquid form,
ready to go back into anything you're
[SPEAKER_02]: brewing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it's a hundred percent good
thing, but I don't view marijuana being
[SPEAKER_02]: flavored.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've recently had, uh, terpene tests at
the lab that I'm, you know, I go through
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm friends with the workers there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're eight plus percent terpenes being
tested at that lab with you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: only a half a dozen terpenes being tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an impossibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it tells you these people are only
trying to, they're doing whatever they can
[SPEAKER_02]: to sell the rec weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's, it's a very wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you, when you initially said 8%,
I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, but yeah, I guess that makes
sense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're trying to game the
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, um, you know, it, it kind of boils
down to where it's, uh, with people
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking electronic, uh, cigarettes,
the flavors have been, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so poosified that everybody's sucking on
stuff that, I mean, I'll walk through
[SPEAKER_02]: cloud of it and it actually smells good to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're actually just getting their
nicotine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes it so much less offensive than
a cigarette, but, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you still got to deal with, um,
other things with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do, I don't think it's the
smartest thing to breathe glycol or
[SPEAKER_02]: glycerin or any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, I'm like a natural flower guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: My God, you can't really, I don't know how
old school I am, but it goes very straight
[SPEAKER_02]: back to, I want a damn joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't go past the cheeky bong hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I love what you called.
[SPEAKER_02]: I scrubbed my bong out with alcohol and
filled it with nice cold water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, Oh man, I was smoking that
purple, um, wookie V2 and, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's real unique purple
profiles, different than other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's nothing like that flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're alternate with, uh, five different
forms of distillation and then
[SPEAKER_02]: reconfiguring it to your taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good for you, but that's not good
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I can agree with that sentiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that brings us to our last few
questions, which are kind of quick fire
[SPEAKER_01]: questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first one up, what's your favorite
strain of all time?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one that nobody knows about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Waco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the, um, just a local strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everybody that ever knew of Waco will
agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you suspect is the genetics
behind that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, NL5 needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haha, it pops its head up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So flip side of the spectrum, what's your
least favorite strain of all time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, that's so easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dynafem purple power.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck a friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, he just thought it'd be smart to grow
fams about 15, 10, 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a clandestine grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically his wife didn't want him to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: He dug up the dug out the basement under
the house and he gets that shit and man,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was poor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, it was dark purple or real pretty
purple, lots of, uh, violet and magenta.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the a lot of dark purple too,
but it was a no high pig and it tasted
[SPEAKER_02]: like shitty purple.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've all had an experience or two
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would be your desert Island
strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take three with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would they be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, purple Hindu Kush that I got from,
uh, the nature farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's really the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I would say TKNL five Hays,
the one that we are just now digging
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the other one, it's going to have
to be that my old dream time chocolate tie
[SPEAKER_02]: that, um, you know, truly had me going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the high was so high that it
could have been damn opium dipped,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but I was still, you know,
you know, 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but, uh, there are no highs like that
anywhere in the world today except opium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, next question is if you could only
recommend one of your strains for someone
[SPEAKER_01]: to go out or let's say give them a packet,
just so that it's, it's there in their
[SPEAKER_01]: hands, which one pack would you be given
to people?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I would go with the TKNL five,
uh, Hays F2, but until I, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just rediscovered that, I would have said
skunk cabbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave out over 3000 seeds of it,
hundreds of packs of it, and then sold
[SPEAKER_02]: hundreds of packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never had one person ever say bad
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, pretty damn good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a solid one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you could go back in time to any
place, anywhere throughout history to
[SPEAKER_01]: presumably collect some Landry seeds,
where would you be heading?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this, tell me, you tell me,
cause you know, the answer going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: some tie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it'll be there, but I'm going to the
castle right to the cannabis castle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at the collection at that point
in time, what was available to the layman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like a hundred years worth of work
done waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go, uh, Steel Neville's collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're going to hit it on every
note, including the, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: G 13 in his purest form and just like
everything and it's purest form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will, uh, I would join you on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can get a time machine, um,
we're going there first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you most excited about that's
going to come from the community in the
[SPEAKER_01]: near future?
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as you can tell, I guess just the,
um, overall, uh, legislation that's being
[SPEAKER_02]: put in for nationwide legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's fair for people that
live in Arkansas and, um, Texas and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, Georgia and the, uh, Nebraska,
you know, there's anti-states that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not fair at all for medicinal users.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, especially them, but, and it's a super
legitimate thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are their treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as outcasts and heavy drug users
and won't give them an opportunity to,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, get any relief from
something that's going to help them
[SPEAKER_02]: without, you know, have adverse effects to
anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a good biomass producer
and help the earth as opposed to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, destroying the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, the movement should spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like the idea of Marlboro,
you know, producing packs of marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: cigarettes, and then that's going to be
the main strength thing would be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, concentrate pens and I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dream would be that, um, have both
sides available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what we do up here, we're able to
still have a medical permit up here and I
[SPEAKER_02]: can grow with my wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can have 60 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can have a six plant count plus a 24
plant extended medical count.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she can also, so if you could have a
happy medium in all the states of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, say I'm like 12 plants because
they're harsh now going down to six and
[SPEAKER_02]: three and then completely blocking in
other places.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the legalization movement is bound to
happen and the decriminalization and
[SPEAKER_02]: rescheduling of cannabis from schedule
one, that is going to be the biggest and
[SPEAKER_02]: best thing in the cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might, you know, help out corporate way
more than it'll help out the mom and pop,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it'll give relief to the people that
couldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
Certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So final question for the interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we expect to ever see your seeds
available via some seed banks kind of more
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially available?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not against, um, selling through seed
banks, but I am still working a nine to
[SPEAKER_02]: five job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though the earthquake had destroyed
the body shop and we're at a low point,
[SPEAKER_02]: we are, you know, fixing to go back online
and I don't, really want to walk away from
[SPEAKER_02]: what I've done for very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I will probably, uh, pick up a
couple seed banks just because I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: offered and it just makes me have to work
harder though, to make the commitment and
[SPEAKER_02]: keep everything happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I didn't, uh, so it's either quit
working, quit fishing and hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, um, and I don't want to, I don't want
to do either one of those yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crazy, but yeah, I would say, yeah,
it's going to, I'm not, I'm not the kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of guy that's going to jump on everything
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it's coming, coming to the future
near you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, did you have any
comments or shout out you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: To, uh, you, um, all Australians,
I think, uh, they're probably the next
[SPEAKER_02]: best people, um, next to Alaska.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, my partners of 35 years for not
ever having a problem with what I've done
[SPEAKER_02]: and said, we've just always been together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, my wife of 29 years, probably the
only thing that, uh, keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a beautiful sentiment to end it on.
