[SPEAKER_02]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
The Podcast, the cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_02]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to be back after our short
break and we hope we didn't leave you all
[SPEAKER_02]: with too much withdrawals.
[SPEAKER_02]: This show, as always, was brought to you
by 420 Australia and OGS, Organic
[SPEAKER_02]: Gardening Solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, we're joined by one of
the most controversial figures in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, the man himself, Matt Ryan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, so a big welcome to arguably the
most controversial man in the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: the punk rocker himself, Matt Ryan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first question I like to ask people
is let's go back to the start.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: My first experience with cannabis,
my dad was a grower and a smuggler and a
[SPEAKER_01]: dealer of all kinds of different wonderful
drugs when I was young.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, one of the first smells I
remember smelling was cannabis and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: how far I went back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was able to water for him when
I was little and really during those
[SPEAKER_01]: years, I had no interest in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a terrible chore.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I got older, of course, the interest
grew a lot more when I started smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what was the first strain you
remember smoking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, you know, we didn't really have
names for strains back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just like skunk bud,
you know, that's pretty much what they
[SPEAKER_01]: called it, all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they call it like red hair or
orange hair, which really didn't mean
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just happened to have more orange or
more red hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's pretty much the only names
that they ever called any of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think that any of that stuff
you would like consider working nowadays?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it some of that glorious?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, you know, I mean, a lot of it's
going to be the Mexican stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe very little Colombian at that time
because I was too young to really hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombian era.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of it was going to be a lot of
the really shitty, shittily grown,
[SPEAKER_01]: very moldy Mexican stuff they were pushing
through Arizona and California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably not, not a whole lot of
wonderful things coming through there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so before you got into breeding
yourself, were there ever any breeders you
[SPEAKER_02]: were kind of looking up to or was it more
of just like a natural progression to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, Ingmar, who created White
Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, that was a big strain when I
was young.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that was one of the first named
strains that we heard about other than
[SPEAKER_01]: Alaskan Thunderfuck, Madness Catholic
Thunderfuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, Blueberry with DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_01]: The name was well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the stuff Neville Schoenmaker
did, you know, was it like the NL5,
[SPEAKER_01]: Big Bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that stuff was very big around
that time as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of the bigger names
around the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you feel those genetics
stand up to some of the ones today?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like a contested topic
where the, you know, older stuff was
[SPEAKER_02]: better than now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like you can still go back to a
lot of those old NL5 haze lines and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's people like Terro Rojo that work
those now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still the same lines that were
available back then and they're still just
[SPEAKER_01]: as dank as anything we're putting out now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, as with anything,
there's a large phenotypic selection that
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to go on and it takes a large
election to go through all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, back then people weren't doing
these massive selections like they can do
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the space was so much more
limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, they tend to stand the test of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many that still do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a matter of what people prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of what people prefer now is the
visual look of like the hard, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: dense nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that wasn't what it looked like as
much back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still had a lot of the sativa airy
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've noticed that that real swollen bract
kind of look from like that cookies has is
[SPEAKER_02]: very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, especially out here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that essentially, do you just
kind of subscribe to that idea that some
[SPEAKER_02]: people have that those older genetics
were, you know, some of the best and we've
[SPEAKER_02]: watered them down in a sense or more just
taken in a different but equal direction?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say, you know, I mean, if you look at
the THC values, they've actually increased
[SPEAKER_01]: over all the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, in that sense, if you just
look at the THC percentage and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people subscribe to that being the most
important factor with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you believe that way, which I don't
personally, then yeah, we've increased and
[SPEAKER_01]: made everything better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, just through selection alone,
I mean, even if people aren't breeders,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to keep picking the best
just as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ratio is going to keep going up as far
as what the best is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think today, we have a wider
selection, a more diverse selection of
[SPEAKER_01]: really amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not just a one or two skunk
types, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, if we go back a bit now,
like some of the earliest information I
[SPEAKER_02]: could find on you as a breeder was you
being a part of that small crew,
[SPEAKER_02]: the modern militia with Loomper and the
Blazers and Haze Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that kind of come about?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like as a bit of a follow up,
what led to the breakdown of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I wasn't really in the modern
militia crew, just friends with all of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Loomper, Loomper was a good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: He still is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moda is a good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haze Man made a lot of the gear for Moda.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breakdown, I mean, I would say
probably stepping on toes saying it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I mean, Moda retires three times a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's kind of what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were just like, oh, man,
like he's going to retire.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know, like some people start going
away and then, you know, he's back a few
[SPEAKER_01]: months later.
[SPEAKER_01]: He then comes back and he retires.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, more power to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess in that regard,
he's probably been in retired.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, he's still he's still
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's still he's still doing his thing,
still making cool shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but yeah, a lot of those guys are still
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess, you know, do you did you kind
of start out on your own from the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning or were you kind of teamed up
with someone to begin with?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started, like getting into
serious breeding, my mentor was a guy
[SPEAKER_01]: named James Hogg Gonzalez, who made the
original Hogg's Breath out of San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he taught me a lot of what was going
on with breeding and and all the work he
[SPEAKER_01]: had done with the Hogg's Breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to work on lines with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: We released a few seed lines and then he
passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my my first real experience
working with a real breeder hands on and
[SPEAKER_01]: releasing lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also had the San Diego Urban Growers
Society, which was basically a collective
[SPEAKER_01]: there was 32 of us at one point and we
would basically grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put our own money into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow only for giving weed away to
cancer internally, ill patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no it wasn't like a collective
where we give them to achieve or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the cost came out of our pockets
and we did it just because there was no
[SPEAKER_01]: other collective in San Diego doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was it was just it was a great grab
for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wanted to push against that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so was that kind of what draw you to
breeding initially?
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you trying to develop better strains
for that collective or was that like a
[SPEAKER_02]: track?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing that initially tried to
get me to breed or led me down that path
[SPEAKER_01]: was my best friend's mom had pancreatic
cancer and she kind of raised me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during that time, I saw the only thing
that was giving her her dignity back to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to get out of bed and even like come
have dinner with us was being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke and only a few strains would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was hit or miss all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during that time was when I really,
really got heavily into it when she was
[SPEAKER_01]: still alive and she she only lived about
eight months with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just kept going from then on out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then came the the San Diego Urban
Grows Society came out of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: evolved out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so were you initially just interested
in regular seeds or was feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: always something on your mind seeing as
that's something you are fairly well known
[SPEAKER_02]: for?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't matter to me because I had
already learned really early on how to
[SPEAKER_01]: reverse plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't matter to me whether I had a
male or a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could always reverse a female and make a
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's either or.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of stigma between back then
about breeding with feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But looking at the science, even back
then, it was just like I realized,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, this is like a old wives tale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these people don't understand the
science behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just going to keep repeating
the same bullshit until they understand
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I've always been pretty open to
breeding with both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I mean, if we want to get into the
kind of biology of all that, do you
[SPEAKER_02]: believe that, you know, pollen produced
from a feminized plant is different on the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic level from pollen from just a
straight hermaphrodite plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not so much on a genetic level,
because all cannabis is a dual sex plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all of it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how much it expresses it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much of the how much of the hormones
are activated in that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you reverse a plant using like
silver thiosulfate, which is what most of
[SPEAKER_01]: us use, you're tricking the plant not
necessarily into thinking it's stressed,
[SPEAKER_01]: but but to releasing more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's halting gibberellin, if I remember
correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's bringing in gibberellin,
halting ethylene production, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: gas ethylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by doing that, it's it's making the
plant or more male characteristics less
[SPEAKER_01]: female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not causing any stress to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're when you're
hermaphroditing a plant, you're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing that stress into it and you're
pushing the stress on into its progeny to
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people say that, you know,
all feminized seeds are more bound to
[SPEAKER_01]: herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not necessarily correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of plants that you cannot
stress and push to to herm through stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can do it using the silver
thiosulfate method, because it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: stress method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that sounds really similar to what I
have always kind of theorize has happened,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just kind of clarify.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we kind of saying that, you know,
in a in a stressed hermaphroditic plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: the stress causes, say, maybe some
epigenetic changes or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: which are then put into the pollen and
passed on, whereas the thiosulfate doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was the first feminized crust you
ever made or tried to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, I think one of the first ones was
either green crack or blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making an S1 line of one of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really early on when I did the
green crack and it was still, I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: was right around the same time I did the
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't remember which came first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, this will be another good
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very hotline to be S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that the variation in
quality, because I've seen some really
[SPEAKER_02]: good blue dreams and some horrible blue
dreams from different breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think the difference is the cutting
they used or is a good feminized project
[SPEAKER_02]: taking several stages?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, a good feminized product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Project is always going to take several
stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, most people don't ever get to
do more than one stage because people want
[SPEAKER_01]: it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you if you try to work on it for
too long, then they lose interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe maybe the line isn't as popular,
you know, next season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it becomes worthless, you know,
as far as making seeds and spending your
[SPEAKER_01]: time doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of them don't ever get work more
than one generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with blue dream, there's a specific
cut from Santa Cruz called the SC cut the
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Cruz cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one to me has been like the
supreme blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one that for a long time,
everybody in San Diego was growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone up north in Santa Cruz was
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where its reputation came from
is being like this amazing, almost
[SPEAKER_01]: connoisseur level massive yielder with
tons of resin production and a really like
[SPEAKER_01]: very light, light, light blueberry smell
with a nice like it had like a tie
[SPEAKER_01]: uplifting happy high as opposed to a
speedy haze high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the other pretty much any
blue haze out there now like a blueberry
[SPEAKER_01]: haze cross people are calm blue dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a lot of shitty blue haze
crosses because haze is not like the most
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing line to breed with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting opinion there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get into that in a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, follow up question is,
do you think that a lot of the you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: shittier cuts of blue dream are maybe s
ones from the Santa Cruz?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think just they're just various
people have made it because that's it's an
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting point you brought up where I
don't think blue dream was made by one
[SPEAKER_02]: person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think many people have made that cross
and you know, the yeah, so what I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's there's Johnny blaze.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was another line released by legend
seed line.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was also another blueberry haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: But blueberry haze has been being made by
hundreds of people over over a decade,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I think it's just a popular
name with anything that has blueberry in
[SPEAKER_01]: it or a blueberry smell that yields well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that like in California,
the name change game is so stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been going on for so long and people
just don't give a shit what they pass out
[SPEAKER_01]: or what they call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it sells, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think that was the major the
major impetus behind all these fucked up
[SPEAKER_01]: blue dream crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we did the blue dream reversal,
almost they weren't I wouldn't say they
[SPEAKER_01]: were perfectly uniform or IBL or anything,
but they were they were really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all the phenotypes were fairly
predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they definitely resembled the mom
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could always see a good resemblance to
the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, the thing which stands out
to me above most every other person I've
[SPEAKER_02]: interviewed is music seems to be such an
influential part of your life,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they almost mutually exclusive
breeding in music or does one kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: inspire the other or?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for me, you know, music
influenced my life a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in bands since I was 12 and like
playing shows, punk rock shows and being
[SPEAKER_01]: in the punk rock scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is just a wild time in California
to be alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't like, you know, the era of Green
Day where everything was safe and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kids could get dropped off
downtown and it was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like if you went to punk
shows, you knew you were going to get in a
[SPEAKER_01]: fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to be fucking terrifying,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growing up in that kind of scene,
it's hard not to let it influence your
[SPEAKER_01]: life, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, music's always been a big part of my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just somehow ran straight head into
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the whole attitude that I had in
the music scene into this, because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of nasty people in our scene and our
cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just I've met them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met all of them head first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like a magnet to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just have to take that whole,
I don't give a fuck, fuck you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it just worked hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how did Riot Seed start then?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was after the project with James Hogg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we had started talking
about doing Riot Seed stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had already started working on the
Clockwork Order strain and he had sold a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, dude, these are selling really
well, the work we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, why don't you start doing some
of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had already worked on the Clockwork
Order strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were passing it out in San Diego to
the cancer eternally ill patients that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually wanted to grow for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just kind of where it came to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just started like,
okay, well, I need a name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my name in band since I was little
was always Matt Riot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Riot Seeds makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just started from there with the
Clockwork Orange and then spread on out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a lot of people, including myself,
are interested to hear, what's the real
[SPEAKER_02]: history behind the Clockwork Orange?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it seems to be really bits and
pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here and there online, but there's never
the full story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it kind of sucks because I've told
the story a bunch, but every time I go
[SPEAKER_01]: look it up or I see it somewhere,
it looks like all jumbled, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a dude named, I just call him
Crazy Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nobody called him that but me,
just because he was fucking crazy and his
[SPEAKER_01]: name was Doug.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was this weird dude that lived out in
the hills of San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had this big, massive house left to him
by his parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole thing was a grove.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking his bathrooms, every fucking
room, his basements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he trained drug dogs for the cops,
which was even more weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these evil German Shepherd dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd speak to them in German and trained
them to be drug dogs for cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this dude was also a tweaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I mean, he had syringes
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he was out of his fucking mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I met this guy through,
I think, Craigslist or something at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time that was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wanted to trade clones with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll come visit you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea what I was getting head
first into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went out there, I met him and he was
an interesting dude, very weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he showed me this really, really weird
plant that had all these crinkle
[SPEAKER_01]: mutations.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, man, I got this from
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: This came from a bag of Alaskan ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Alaskan ice at the time was not a
greenhouse strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something they were selling at the
coffee shop as bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it wasn't anything that they had named
a strain yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the genetics obviously looked,
the high was really sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves were more narrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Early in veg and then later in veg,
they got really wide blade drug type,
[SPEAKER_01]: like almost looking Afghani, but it had
this weird crinkle to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, yeah, man, this is as
strong as the hash from the parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took it, ran with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started working the line and I was
trying to take the crinkle out of it
[SPEAKER_01]: because it just looked so weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, people are not going to be
into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can get the high and the smell and
the taste, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need to get rid of this crinkle
because people think it's ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time we took a step away breeding
the crinkle out, the potency was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kept creeping away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But every time we'd have the phenotype
with a crinkle pop up, it was back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up taking that and just having
to go basically work backwards from there
[SPEAKER_01]: and trying to remake that original clone
that I had for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we found that, that original
clone or the closest resemblance to that
[SPEAKER_01]: original clone, that's what became
Clockwork Orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody knows what it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since Alaskan Ice wasn't a real strain at
the time, it wasn't a white widow haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a white widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got Afghani, some sort of skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely has some haze in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to what degree of each and what actual
strains are in it, I have no clue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sorry, just to confirm, do you breed
with the original cut or with the back
[SPEAKER_02]: cross I think you said you make?
[SPEAKER_01]: The original mother cut that was the
crinkle cut that was used to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: lines that we used to pick the Clockwork
Orange mom out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so are any other of those lines being
used to breed with currently or just the
[SPEAKER_02]: other one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every once in a while we'll bust out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made the very first line of S1s of the
Clockwork Orange cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made a line called Smart Alex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically that was like this really
super coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just smelled like when you open a fresh
thing of Folger's coffee and smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smelled just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was more dense than Clockwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was less resinous, but more dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it still had a really good potency to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one became known as the Smart
Alex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes we use that cut or S1s of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been hard to keep these alive for a
long, long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really, really hard plants to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody that asked me for the cut,
when they finally get it, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: dude, just remember, this is a really hard
plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to respond to you well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually everybody gets so mad at it,
they'll throw it out eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kept its rarity because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just really hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me a long time to master it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is there any reason why you choose
not to have the S1s continually in stock?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is it something you want to keep
kind of a bit more elusive or?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just hard to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I reverse it, it doesn't produce much
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to reverse a whole room of it to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people complain about the prices of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get that it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I look at the price that I
have to charge to make it worth doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole room of that and getting,
you know, only 400 seeds, something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if I do a whole room of some,
like a regular line with a regular mail,
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands and thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, I try to only do it every
once in a while to where people still have
[SPEAKER_01]: that interest and willing to pay that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I flooded the market with it
and tried charging the same price,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would just, it would be pointless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you kind of brought up an
interesting topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have kind of long criticized your
pricing.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, nowadays we see the rise of
several breeders who routinely charge as
[SPEAKER_02]: much or more than yours, most notably
aficionado.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel pricing plays into the
market?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you think it's simply supply
and demand or is it just haters looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for any excuse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, the way we priced
everything, that's the way we've always
[SPEAKER_01]: done it is on, it really was on supply and
demand and, and popularity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's something like a lot of people
wanted and we had a hundred seeds of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: then, you know, I usually say make,
make an offer because that's all that's
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what, that's what we have,
you know, and that kind of determined a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've caught a lot of shit for it,
but there's a few reasons for doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I don't, it's the same reason I don't
use testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I don't like necessarily want a bunch
of new growers trying to run really hard
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that causes is problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always causes problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: New growers want, you know, tend to not
all of them, but a good amount of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to, to make up for their skill
by getting a strain they think will just
[SPEAKER_01]: be super dank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course everything's going to grow
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by having the prices I did,
it kept them away and, and, and it kept
[SPEAKER_01]: the rarity up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, most of the people
that buy for me are breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: They aren't new growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I see a lot of insults
online, but I also sell seats for 50 bucks
[SPEAKER_01]: a pack on down to 30 bucks a pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the ones they tend to want are
the ones that are the cheapest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you feel that seeds are going to
continually increase in price?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, there's seeds that are
currently going in like Instagram auctions
[SPEAKER_02]: for thousands of dollars routinely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this is a trend that'll just
continue or do you think it'll cap out
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends how stupid the market is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there, I mean, a lot of this shit
selling for a lot of money is fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: retarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, the efficient audio stuff,
like, I mean, jeans makes some cool shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but 99% of that, like I'm looking at the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was talking about their OG Kush line
being a Pakistani lemon tie, whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: like just the typical line of what people
think OG Kush is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously these guys haven't done their
fucking homework and they're charging an
[SPEAKER_01]: assload for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but as long as the market remains
stupid and ignorant to what is what then
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's sky's the limit on how
much they'll pay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what do you think is the real
origins of OG Kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I mean, it's, it's an Afghan,
any sort of plant it's stretchy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that doesn't necessarily mean it
couldn't be all indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, it has a lot of the tide
trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the happiness of the hive,
but it's obviously got the density of a
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be something around there,
but who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, I've heard so many fucking stories
that, well, that could make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it all ends up being bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I quit trying to figure it out a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Digging through your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that you received a cutting of
Skelly, which is a strain that's popped up
[SPEAKER_02]: on the show before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was around during the time or a
little bit before of the dog bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your opinion on Skelly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's a great plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I had heard of it first before
from JJ New York, uh, several years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was called the puck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I guess the guy who used to sell it
used to put it in like a, like almost like
[SPEAKER_01]: a bubble tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an American thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's like a bubble gum case and it was
round like a disc, like almost like a
[SPEAKER_01]: hockey puck and he, or like a Copenhagen
pack puck looking thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would sell it in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that, that nickname stuck with it
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Skelly hash plant is just like a
really dank, stinky Afghani plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really good though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what, that's one of those ones that
definitely stood the test of time,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for dankness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so another thing I found digging on
Instagram is whenever bubble gum comes up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're always sure to make sure that
people know you're not referring to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Indiana bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the story behind all of this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, we made it, I usually didn't
point it out too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: We made the original bubble gum cookies
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ever since I've made that I've had
fucking the cookie fam knock it off,
[SPEAKER_01]: say it was this or that, you know,
I haven't, there's another guy on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram, I think he calls himself like
bubble gum cookie man or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's taking credit for it saying,
yeah, this is the Indiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not, it's, it's been like the
Indiana bubble gum doesn't pass on a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of pink bubble gum traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're slight there in the, in the cut,
but it is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not by any means, you know,
something you'd smell and go, Hmm,
[SPEAKER_01]: pink bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the cutting we had was from the
original 1995 sensei star line.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had the seed line that was originally
released as a regular line by 1996.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cut back to a feminized line and
the regular seeds were very hard to find,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we've had, we've had a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to them and we kept a large stock
of them so we could go through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, in there, there's one phenotype that
is like a menthol pink bubble gum line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an amazing breeder and it passes
on that really super pink bubble gum smell
[SPEAKER_01]: and taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we used in the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I mean, people, they just assume
like, you know, if they want to say this
[SPEAKER_01]: is their line, they're assuming that the
Indiana bubble gum was in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's just kind of frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another one of those things where
it's like what the Indiana bubble gum line
[SPEAKER_01]: is and how it breeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've never say that in a million years
that that's what it was, but it just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, again, people making just stupid
claims, getting used to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in that same kind of vein, most of your
releases, like you just mentioned with the
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble gum cookies, they, they don't seem
to be like they're going to be restocked
[SPEAKER_02]: for certain, you know, like a lot of your
strains seem to, you need to treat them as
[SPEAKER_02]: though they're possibly one offs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that how you view them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you make a lot of lines with the
intention of restocking them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I never make any line with the intention
of restocking them unless they're special.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, we do a lot of our testing
in house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use testers because 99% of the
time they don't know what they're doing to
[SPEAKER_01]: even begin to test anything and they
really don't even grow trader.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we stopped using testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do all our testing in house.
[SPEAKER_01]: We watch everything ourselves,
you know, run through all the phenos we're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see what we have and we know what we're
offering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a lot of the lines, unless they're
really, really good, I usually don't bring
[SPEAKER_01]: them back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble gum cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a version two of, uh, I'm just a
second generation of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, cookie berry, which is,
probably one of our most, uh, knocked off
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's going around California and clone
is blue cookies and all kinds of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another one cookie fam is
taking credit for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we've released another version of that
using OGKB instead of the forum cut,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I actually do prefer the forum cut
cross, which is the original one to the
[SPEAKER_01]: version, second version.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we do it again, we'll probably go
back to the original cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you like to specifically list
what generations are being used for your
[SPEAKER_02]: projects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you, yeah, I'm specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like in a parent I've noticed,
I mean, maybe I'm wrong here, but do you
[SPEAKER_02]: always list, you know, that like this
isn't, you know, let's just say,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, with the, I forget the name of the
strain you mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: The, that particular S one of the
clockwork orange, the lazy Ben was smart
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex smart Alex smart Alex.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so, um, the smart Alex, you know,
do you, would you, would you, do you like
[SPEAKER_02]: to write like smart Alex brackets
clockwork orange S one or is it just smart
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause sometimes I've noticed there's more
work into the new list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually like the smart Alex in that
case, it was smart Alex in parentheses
[SPEAKER_01]: clockwork orange S one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people can like kind of trust what,
what it's saying on the package.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, cause if I would be the same way,
like I want to know exactly what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: getting and you know, what's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hope everybody else would too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to be pretty, pretty damn
specific with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're breeding regularly,
regular projects like regular sex
[SPEAKER_02]: projects, not feminized, what is the
numbers you'd ideally like to use for such
[SPEAKER_02]: a project in terms of like finding parents
or testing progeny?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, for, for a road line, we went through
eight years of different Afghani lines
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, um, super skunk lines looking,
I mean, I can't even count it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number of seeds is astronomical,
but eight years of constantly every run
[SPEAKER_01]: cracking more and more Afghani seeds and,
and super skunk lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: To try to find the roadkill line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that was an ideal, you know,
run on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of our best ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been one of the most successful
regular, regular seed lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like, it just depends on what you
have to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one thing that I always,
I would make a habit of before I go do any
[SPEAKER_01]: runs through any lines, if I only have a
pack of something, I'm going to F to it
[SPEAKER_01]: and run through those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have, you know, a multitude of seeds
to look through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like, um, in the case of the,
the roadkill skunk, which is something
[SPEAKER_02]: gets brought up in almost every episode,
you've got several lines which feature,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, roadkill skunk traits or from
the roadkill Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, how would you describe this line?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, to you, is it a replica or just
a homage, something similar?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, where do you rate it in comparison
to the original roadkill skunk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the original roadkill skunk was not
a sunk one line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just an Afghani that happened to
smell like a skunk and people called it
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that often gets confused and
confabulated with skunk number one that
[SPEAKER_01]: was released by Sam the skunk man,
you know, and then taken to Amsterdam and
[SPEAKER_01]: it, which is like, uh, there's a lot of
phenotypes that are sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's citrus, there's all kinds of shit,
but what you don't get is straight up
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk spray, like, like an American skunk
spray, you know, being run over in the
[SPEAKER_01]: road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, the, like our roadkill is like
that, but it also has another trait that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really strong old Afghanis, which is burnt
rubber, like a burnt rubber tennis ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some slight ammonia to it
too, which is often described as like an
[SPEAKER_01]: acrid and taste.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so which of those crosses do you feel
is the most representative of the roadkill
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk then?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Sourdub, which in itself,
considering what's out there and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: been out there is already a pretty skunk
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which is why we chose that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we did a reversed cross with,
uh, the, the Afghani mom that had the most
[SPEAKER_01]: roadkill traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we released that as roadkill
Afghani feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we used a male from the pure
Afghani line that we found the roadkill
[SPEAKER_01]: mom in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the same exact type traits and
turps, uh, when we reversed him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to test him out first by
reversing him using, uh, etheril and
[SPEAKER_01]: florel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to see what kind of turpings he
put out well ahead of the time before we
[SPEAKER_01]: used any of the males.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was our regular seed line of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is that, that's the process where you,
you reverse the male and get like female
[SPEAKER_02]: sex plants, like, you know, buds and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I mean, you don't get like full on,
like you're not going to get like a female
[SPEAKER_01]: with thick ass buds and stuff,
but you will see a lot more resin
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see some flowers and
you'll get a better idea of what turpings
[SPEAKER_01]: he produces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, even if he produces those
turpings, it doesn't necessarily mean he's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to pass them on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you at least get the first idea of
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to use them to see if
the traits get passed on reliably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is that a process you like to do
for all regular males or just the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the long processes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's something I've been doing more
and more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a really valuable tool that was
really overlooked for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and now it's becoming more and more
popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've been talking about it for a
few years and I'm slowly noticing more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more people doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a good thing because
all it can do is advance breeding for
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone, making selection easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what are some of the traits you
look for in a male when you're just
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaf serration, structure, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, back in the day, I used to look
for, I mean, really it is a shot in the
[SPEAKER_01]: dark, the first, the first round with a
male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, early on I used to look for a
male that was the most like a female,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I had that like,
I was sure was going to be a female when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was looking at it, you know, right before
it showed any sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, okay, I don't have to,
you know, keep an eye too bad on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is obviously a female, you know,
that's what I would look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as time went on, I realized,
you know, that was still 50 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was still hair minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it didn't always work and I'd have to
throw out whole lines that I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really we just keep all of our males
and we just try to find something that has
[SPEAKER_01]: a structure that we like one that produces
resin naturally on its own without having
[SPEAKER_01]: to be reversed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cross them and then we see how he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just, it's, it's a long ass
process, but that's the only reliable way
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, you touched on it earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the clockwork orange,
only producing a small number of seeds for
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole room to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're producing female pollen,
is that something which just comes down to
[SPEAKER_02]: the individual cut as to how well it
responds to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it really like a methodology based
process where like the better you are at
[SPEAKER_02]: it, the more pollen you'll get and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, pollen collection is hard with
reversals in the first place, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, man, it goes down to the exact plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes down to the environment,
the plants and every, every last little
[SPEAKER_01]: variable matters with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants reverse better than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some really suck at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the really dense Indica's are
really hard to reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just because the, the male,
the male clusters, the male parts,
[SPEAKER_01]: they cluster up and get really hard and
they're hard to pick out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they don't just burst like a
regular male, the nuts don't hang,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's, that's something that
happens a lot with really dense Indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people like reversing more
less dense sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you think being able to get a
lot of pollen from such strains would just
[SPEAKER_02]: come down to training the plant to maybe
have very few bud sites in so that you
[SPEAKER_02]: could do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's just still, still more like
intricate than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there, there's actually certain
chemicals you can use to make the clusters
[SPEAKER_01]: be less dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've, I've had someone else help me
with that and kind of figure out that
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it's been so helpful in that
part because that was always the main
[SPEAKER_01]: problem with reversing a lot of like the
OG cushions and stuff like that and never
[SPEAKER_01]: getting enough seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was just that, that dense formation
of clustered balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, trying to pull the pollen out,
you literally had to go in with tweezers
[SPEAKER_01]: and do it by hand and shake it into a bag,
each little cluster.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we have another chemical that'll
stretch it out, make them hang a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more and it's much easier to collect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, even over time, it's getting
easier for us to do and we're developing
[SPEAKER_01]: better methods every, every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what, what strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: Has been the best one to reverse in your
opinion, your favorite one to work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Bubba, just the old Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for some reason, even though it has
dense, uh, bud formations, it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: been really reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's always kicked out a lot of
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just always been really reliable and
really easy to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and it tends to have amazing
progeny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never really had a bad Bubba reversal
or bad Bubba cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause Bubba is a strain I personally love
a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think the history on it is?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people say,
Matt Bubba made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like Matt Bubba a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he's got some valid stuff he said
with, with the, sorry, some just fell.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a valid point with, uh,
with OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's got a lot of documentation
with his friend, Josh, being one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: original guys that were passing it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, Bubba, he was saying,
I think came around 96, but you can go to
[SPEAKER_01]: a high times magazine in 94 and see Bubba
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know that the, the Oregon
Afghani tends to look a lot, probably
[SPEAKER_01]: closest to Bubba as a mom for Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some people say West coast dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's obviously an Afghani of some
sort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting because I, um,
I spoke to professor P of dynasty and he,
[SPEAKER_02]: he thinks that the Oregon Afghani is maybe
an S one of Bubba, which is maybe the
[SPEAKER_02]: other way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be, that could be,
um, he's worked with it a lot more than I
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, the West coast dog is another
thing you brought up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed finder has quite a long-winded story
about, you know, contrary to the Matt
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubba story explaining how they think
that's the Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you put any credit to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it's all just kind of
Chinese whispers?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the West coast dog gained a lot
of popularity, um, with a guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: a group of guys called the brothel
brothers and they were some, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: con men, cock suckers and they've had like
a few different names that they've used
[SPEAKER_01]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they've used trichome Kings and
screwed over a bunch of people on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sierra seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys, Sierra seeds, um, brothel
brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've used all those names and it seems
to be that the West coast dog originates
[SPEAKER_01]: with those guys, the story, the strain,
everything comes from those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what's it like to you though?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see any traits of the Bubba in it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, you know, I would say,
I would probably guess if anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like a, a Bubba, a hybrid with some
sort of narrow leaf sativa type plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something, something fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping on the topic of history,
I saw in a, I think it was either an
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram post or on a forum somewhere you
were dropping some knowledge about Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grinspoon and the, uh, the origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very hotly contested strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what do you know about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the first time I heard about that
strain, it was called Quaze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Ed from Delta nine sent it to me and
it was just a clone only strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't think much was known about
its, its history other than it probably
[SPEAKER_01]: was a Southeast Asian of some sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it was Thai, Filipino,
it was something from Southeast Asia and
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that clone that like a lot of the
pictures we'll see on the sensei seed
[SPEAKER_01]: site.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look into, uh, to Quaze clone only,
that's what the pictures were of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, Barney's farm got a cut of it,
reversed it, sold it as Dr. Grinspoon and
[SPEAKER_01]: that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because online on that same seed finder,
website, they say that it's, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: a reefer man strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget the name of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good Lord.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's not that it was, uh,
the Oregon tie across to something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, the Oregon purple tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fucking idiot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, you know, I, me and me and yeah,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, me and Neville, we're working together
for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was showing maker and reefer man
somehow got in the middle of it and
[SPEAKER_01]: started getting Neville to try to send me
or me to try to send cuts to him through
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like I had art,
he had already fucked over so many of my
[SPEAKER_01]: friends in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know, dude,
they probably don't want to talk to this
[SPEAKER_01]: guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really want to send him anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's kind of a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, Neville insisted.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, no, man, I say he's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you're my friend,
you'll send him this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's he do?
[SPEAKER_01]: He fucks me over there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, he's, he's notorious for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just a scumbag, uh, ex white power
Nazi guy that just kind of hides out being
[SPEAKER_01]: a piece of shit and makes his resurgence
every now and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he makes a lot of claims himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if seed finder made that
claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made that claim, but either way it's
incorrect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely incorrect.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, you've been working with
the, what you say is the original Girl
[SPEAKER_02]: Scout cookie clone for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the original Girl Scout cookie
clone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause even cookie fam can't really tell
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, the original before the forum
cut was called the forum cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wants to argue over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that was the first one that's
being passed around.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as more people got their hands on it,
they started calling it the forum cut to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to say, oh, well that one's not as
cool as this one we have over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you think that, uh, like most of
the other cuts are S ones from the forum
[SPEAKER_02]: cut or are the seeds that the forum cut
originally came from like that same batch
[SPEAKER_02]: or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, you can get like a forum cut
type plant from reversing cherry pie kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, they could be more S ones of
cherry pie kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be S ones of the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could also be, um, Urkel OG hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that kicks out the same exact type
of phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So God only knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I see the most common being the OG KB
type coming out of Urkel and OG hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, one of the reasons why we're
on this topic is cause one of your new
[SPEAKER_02]: strains coming out is the F1 Durban cross
dosey doe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What inspired this and how did you get
access to the elusive F1 Durban?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been going around for fucking ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just always been known as Mendo
Durban.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it looks a lot like cherry pie,
uh, the original, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was never that rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just only been rare since they've
called it F1 Durban or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's been around forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's not even a pure Durban in any
sense of the word.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a very Indica Dom, which a real
pure Durban is very Sativa Dom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it has a little bit of that anise like
it's a call.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, uh, black licorice to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much, just a hint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, that clones been around
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what do you think are the,
uh, the real origins of the girl scouts
[SPEAKER_02]: you hinted before the cherry pie has one,
maybe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can make like, we can make
girl scout cookies out of OG any,
[SPEAKER_01]: a really old OG like Loompa's headband or,
uh, San Fernando Valley, the real San
[SPEAKER_01]: Fernando Valley cut or face off any of
those you can use and cross to the old
[SPEAKER_01]: Urkel cut and you'll get all the say,
you, I mean, there's a lot of phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come out of that cross, but you will
see cookies type phenotypes coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: just those two strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now F1 Durban might be in it as they call
it, you know, the Mendo Durban,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, because cherry pie does look a lot
like the Mendo Durban and it could just be
[SPEAKER_01]: the cherry pie is the, you know,
the, like a grand daddy purple,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is also an Urkel phenotype or an
Urkel outcross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it could be GDP OG and that,
and that would make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could potentially pull that
out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's the best that I got on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, your work kind of in
contrast to a lot of other breeders is you
[SPEAKER_02]: clearly don't seem to have a problem
breeding with cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, what do you feel in this trend?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you, do you dislike kind of
the hate that cookies gets or you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: mind, you're not bothered by it?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or given, you know, you do breed with it a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was the first one to release
any seeds of it, um, any, any strains of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, um, in seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a long time ago, a long time
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Five, six years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw, I'd give a shit anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I was doing it, no one else
was using it and nobody really wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy it because nobody knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time I sold out of it,
that's when people just started getting
[SPEAKER_01]: popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I missed that whole cookies way for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll use it every now and then
now, but it's definitely not like a main
[SPEAKER_01]: staple of anything I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has its place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, um, the OGKB types are and their
outcrosses are, but that particular one
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're aware, but there's currently
like a bit of an ongoing discussion,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, maybe slightly aggressive,
um, between, uh, gauge green and cookie
[SPEAKER_02]: fam kind of over the origins of the
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, gauge green is saying that they
believe that, uh, the cherry pie Kush is
[SPEAKER_02]: the parent of the, of the cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's probably S ones of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen any of this at all slash,
you know, how, how do you think about
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever seen the cherry pie Kush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I don't, as far as gauge,
green goes, that's a pretty, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a pretty, uh, everybody knows that
I hate that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's not specifically the,
all the guys in it, but the original guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: he goes by key play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he was the first one to use the name
gauge green.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lied and cheated his way through all of
our business.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did it to me, Loompa, a guy named old
hand, a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's, he's made his whole,
his whole campaign on just stabbing
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone in the back that helped him out
along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even Jojo Rizzo was supposed to be one
of his friends that he's named strains
[SPEAKER_01]: after, after, uh, he traded him heroin for
his seed stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I, I have nothing that anytime
that guy talks, I just open my fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: eyes and hope I don't see him in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, interestingly enough,
there seems to be a lot of info online,
[SPEAKER_02]: which indicates that you guys argue over
the origins of the purple elephant slash,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the grape stomper.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, where, where do you see it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it just them who made the grape
stomper or was it Jojo or Jojo made it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was originally called sour grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He passed it out to a bunch of people,
but he never sold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he had a specific clone that he liked
and that, that was the sour grapes mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was passed out to all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was also given to gauge.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was supposed to be his friend and
gauge went and sold it to blue sky cafe as
[SPEAKER_01]: sour grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he started to get mad and said,
I kind of like the name grapes,
[SPEAKER_01]: not for better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what he made the seed line as.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But gauge has nothing to do with the
actual genesis of the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just hijack someone else's same with
his blackberry pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was Jojo's.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's countless other shits he's done
that with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's nothing new.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you feel like it's a interesting
situation that you guys, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like both breed with the same cup,
but there's this kind of animosity between
[SPEAKER_02]: the two is because the reason I bring it
up is there's kind of like a reincarnation
[SPEAKER_02]: of that right now between a Groma and seed
junkie where more or less, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Groma is probably going to breed with some
of seed junkie seeds, even though seed
[SPEAKER_02]: junkies made it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhat obvious he would not like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you feel like there's almost
some parallels between that and you engage
[SPEAKER_02]: with the stomp up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've ever heard of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're nobody's to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess maybe, maybe, maybe the way I
should have phrased the question is,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you, do you think that your rights over
a seed line, um, uh, kind of whatever you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to do with it, as soon as you acquire
them or do you believe like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you should respect the creator's wishes or
something like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it like, no, it's just yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the problem is the creator has been
passed, um, for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just in general, like with any say seed
line, I mean, you know, like if the people
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't, if a breeder isn't currently
making the seed line, he's not making the
[SPEAKER_01]: money off it and he's not, doesn't have
any plans to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would say, as long as you credit
them properly and you've done your
[SPEAKER_01]: research, then, then that's fine and
dandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if you're going to like F twoing
people's seed lines, like, and just
[SPEAKER_01]: changing the name, that's rude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really just the big slap in the face.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that in any other industry
and you shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so similarly we've seen, um,
a bit of an argument between, I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: if I say an argument feud between mellow
from the nature farm and yourself between
[SPEAKER_02]: these, uh, the discrepancies in the
roadkill lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your take in this?
[SPEAKER_02]: His line is, phenotypically seems
different to yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't know who he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, do I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have I said something to him?
[SPEAKER_01]: I might've said so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He could join the club.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just noticed whenever he, whenever he
posts photos of his, uh, his roadkill line
[SPEAKER_01]: he's working on, he, he makes sure that he
says like skunk IBL 69 that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean saying that he has a skunk from
1969.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is like, that is the most fucking
asinine shit I've ever heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes, oh, it takes us like 10 minutes
of research to realize, oh wait,
[SPEAKER_01]: there weren't really many Afghans.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's coming to the U S in 1969.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nor were they being harvested for their
own shit in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were still importing Indian sativa
plants for hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that claim was fucking just stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not an IBL.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's more than one phenotype,
it's not a fucking IBL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, IBL denotes uniformity and anybody see
people use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me roll my fucking eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just had a bunch of I fucking
rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, if we get back to say
maybe, right, seeds, one of many strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: one for example, called blood rose,
um, new credit is being created by a
[SPEAKER_02]: colleague skunko as well as having,
you know, other colleagues like flip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you consider riot seeds to be you as an
individual, like a one man operation or
[SPEAKER_02]: more of like an umbrella for kind of,
you know, you and your friends?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, do you know, there's been so
many people that had a part in my company.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were times when I like, I,
I just lost a lot of, um, I want to do
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything in this business, just from just
being jaded by all the fuck heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were a lot of times other people
picked up and ran with my company and kept
[SPEAKER_01]: it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a guy named 46 and two,
like he took a lot of the work that I had
[SPEAKER_01]: and he kept it going out there or kept
passing it out, kept making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: everything was going while I was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's a guy named racer X.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did the same thing and he's,
he's helped out probably more than anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, skunko, he made two lines for us
and he's, he's an amazing guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just, you know, he's a wonderful guy
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been so many people that are part
of our, our organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of them are the same kind of guys
are just, just people who don't give a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit about what people have to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the, uh, this has actually been a
question we got asked a lot from people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the PIF S1 seeds, what's the go?
[SPEAKER_02]: When are they coming?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the PIF I made those years ago,
but I wasn't allowed to do the S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the guy I got it from was a bouncer
for the Dominicans in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a guy named doggie style D79 and he's
been around for forums forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he passed me the PIF lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one line called H1, one line
called H2.
[SPEAKER_01]: The H1 was like the frankincense type
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: H2 was more like a mango haze type line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something similar that you'd see from
shanty with his mango haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, all I was told was, you know,
you can make as many hybrids with this as
[SPEAKER_01]: you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't S1 it, don't release it pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You keep people holding out for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So similarly, another strain that caught
my eye was the P91.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a San Diego strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the history behind that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how come no one else seems to breed
with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that strain has been gone for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only a few people, including the breeder
have kept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's hard to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like a P91 skunk line that gets
passed around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, that line was
really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I searched for it for 10 years before I
got a legit cut from the breeder and that
[SPEAKER_01]: was hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's supposed to be a according to
him, a silverback tie crossed to Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: Lights, I want to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's really not a lot of tie traits
of it being very, very bushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very bushy plant,
but it's called P91 because it's peanut
[SPEAKER_01]: buttery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for peanut and 91, cause it was made in
1991.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you plan to make any S1s with it
again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, the cut is very old.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't kept very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things that like,
I'd like to tissue culture first and then
[SPEAKER_01]: go ahead and give it another run at S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just really wasn't really happy with the
uniformity of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hard to find a lot of really super
peanutty phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The line could be S1ed a few times to get
some uniformity to make sure that's more
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the neon skunk is a, one of the
parents created by Sonny Chiba that not a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of other people use.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the characteristics about it that
you like and how come again, you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think many other people use it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like a, you know, a hidden gem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, which, which one from Sonny?
[SPEAKER_02]: The neon super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, um, you know, that was just,
I mostly used it because I was trying to,
[SPEAKER_01]: at the time I was trying to find really
good black Russian strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, uh, early on Sonny was one of the
few people that was really like amazing to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is before he left for a long time
and kind of disappeared after the TGA
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he was one of the few people I could
talk to about breeding purples,
[SPEAKER_01]: him and a guy named Nibu.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I personally think a responsible for so
many of the purple, purple work out there
[SPEAKER_01]: and pink work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I couldn't have done it without
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'd be no, I'd have none of my purple
pink work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people attribute,
you know, a lot of my work to being some,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the, the most prolific purple and
pink work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, I attribute all that to those two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the neon super skunk was a black
Russian line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time black Russian was really
hard to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was Nibu's black Russian.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cherry AK across to the Oregon
blackberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Oregon blackberry is a purple
Pakistani Chitrali.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time that was a lot harder to
find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, nowadays, uh, Pakistani Chitrali,
the purple female is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the time it was really hard to
find.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, I, the only reason I
worked with the neon super skunk was just
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the black Russian.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't so much because of the super
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's all in all, it was an amazing
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do you feel about people kind of,
there's, you know, certainly seems to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: rise in popularity of people wanting to go
back to those more raw land racy unworked
[SPEAKER_02]: type stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you feel like this is a,
well spent effort or maybe a waste of
[SPEAKER_02]: time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it just depends on who's doing the
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, any shit head kid fuck something
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on who's doing the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people I see are trying to play
with stuff like that and that's fine and
[SPEAKER_01]: dandy, but if they don't know how it
breeds or out crosses, they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what they're doing with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really have a direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just making crosses to make
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just shooting in the dark and it's
going to be a lot of work for everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you ever think that we'll have,
you know, like another strain emerge that
[SPEAKER_02]: just totally takes over the market,
maybe similar to how skunk or Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: lights do when they were first released
or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, OG Kush, OG Kush was one that
absolutely took over the market and it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: staple now just as much as any skunk or
anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and there's going to be
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cookies, cookies has made quite a
stamp on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though it's not that whole wholly
different from an Urkel or an OG,
[SPEAKER_01]: it still has made its mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there's going to be plenty more to
come.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's still a lot of lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us are digging up and just
planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we have a Senegalese line from Africa
that has like a distinct distinctive
[SPEAKER_01]: lychee smell, which is not a terpene you
find in cannabis anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very specific to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also is a land race sativa or
heirloom sativa more correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that is really resonance and you don't
see that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, there's a lot of strains out
there that are going to be able to bring a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more uniqueness and to our lines.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what do you think about the idea
of, uh, breeding for terpenes specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: or, and then like maybe a follow up to
that is, do you think it's possible for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis to create literally any smell
with its terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a hard question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't even think anybody knows the
answer to that truly, if we can make any
[SPEAKER_01]: smell or any taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I know that there's a lot missing
from the palette, but I, I, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually if you have enough colors,
you know, in your arsenal, you could paint
[SPEAKER_01]: any pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I assume that eventually we'll get
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, breeding for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we did that, we did that with,
uh, the blueberry line that we work that
[SPEAKER_01]: we call Riotberry and trying to find that
original blueberry that is just completely
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry, no skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that was a really hard, hard thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, we spent thousands and
thousands on different blueberry lines
[SPEAKER_01]: from DJ Short.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all of it probably descends from
DJ Short's work originally, but like going
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Canadian blueberries, um,
from DJ's work with Sager Matha,
[SPEAKER_01]: DJ's work with Dutch Passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all different levels of blueberry,
but none of them were really kicking out
[SPEAKER_01]: that heavy duty blueberry smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And bred reliably and, you know,
outcross that blueberry smell and the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's, that's a good example
of terpene work that, that took a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time and was definitely worth it in the
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you feel about the whole
kind of craze with terpenes at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you see people getting
concentrates and just drowning it in
[SPEAKER_02]: liquid terpenes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's a phase or it's the next
step?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't, it looks kind of
crackheady to me, but, um, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people are going to always do the
weirdest shit they can do with it and try
[SPEAKER_01]: to, try to create new fads with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, terpenes definitely have their place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when, when I was watching a lot of
the VHO being made, uh, originally when it
[SPEAKER_01]: was happening in Southern California,
you were missing out on a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and the high was so different and
so speedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was very predictably speedy
with any strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, obviously they play a big part in
the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think the newest thing is going to
be paying more attention to the flavonoids
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavonoids have been really ignored.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's just another thing that
just has another major impact on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, what is your opinion on
kind of dabbing versus flowers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you sit on the spectrum?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and just as a follow up,
I had a friend who kind of described
[SPEAKER_02]: America is now a country of dabbers and
not flower smokers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you feel that's the truth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I hate, I hate to admit it,
but yeah, I mean, like I, I myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I don't like dabbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not that I didn't do it for a long
time, but it really fucked up my lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's too many shit heads doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't, again, like everything else in
the business, alleged head's doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what the fuck they're
doing and they can hurt a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: and they can hurt their lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can make them sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not everyone's getting their shit
tested, obviously, and not all the tests
[SPEAKER_01]: are reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, flowers tend to have the more
complete high and, uh, more terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, that would make the most sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, I guess it's all in the
preference of the person, what it does for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is an individual experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: The high is always an individual
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: No two highs are the same for each person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just really what it's,
that's what it boils down to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me, I flowers any day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you feel about the rise in
testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Oregon seems to, sorry,
when I say that, I mean like pesticide and
[SPEAKER_02]: residue testing, things like that,
because Oregon seems to be leading the
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's just going to keep
getting more and more stringent or we're
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of at a good spot?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the more we let government into
shit, the more fucked up everything is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, at the same time, stuff like
that's necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to get hurt if not,
but no, I mean, as, as, um, more chemicals
[SPEAKER_01]: are being made, you know, it's getting
easier for people to try to sneak by
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So testing is going to have to get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just, it's part of it,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Necessary evil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it seems like the
cannabis industry used to be very much
[SPEAKER_02]: against feminized seeds and there's still
a lot of skepticism out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I feel like there is a slowly changing
trend as more and more mainstream breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: seem to be incorporating feminized into
their projects who were, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the past just regular only.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this is a changing trend
within the community or just maybe like a
[SPEAKER_02]: short term kind of change from the norm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it was, what's funny is a
lot of the people that were dissenters
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe five years ago are now buying my
spray that I make to make their feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I, you know, I don't know,
maybe people are getting more educated
[SPEAKER_01]: finally on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, for years I've been screaming my
head off showing the science behind it and
[SPEAKER_01]: why, like saying this or that applies to
feminize seeds really isn't correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even using the term feminize is
kind of stupid because there's no way you
[SPEAKER_01]: can guarantee any kind of sex on any plant
because environment determines,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, at least, at least 30 to 40% of
what that plant's sexual characteristics
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the term feminize really isn't even
that good of a term.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always use reverse lines just so it
doesn't give that connotation and people
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have expectations that are outside
of reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, there were a lot of people that,
you know, were against it for one reason
[SPEAKER_01]: or another, or just what they had heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like they said, a lot of those people
now are buying the spray for me and using
[SPEAKER_01]: it and creating lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's probably, I mean,
the science is there, so people keep
[SPEAKER_01]: reading it, they'll get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what do you feel about the idea of
doing like, and I'm not even sure if this
[SPEAKER_02]: is the correct terminology, but like S2s
and S3s and like making S1s and S1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like that's going down a shaky
path or it's fine as long as selection's
[SPEAKER_02]: good?
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as the selection's good,
as long as the line's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just run the progeny and then,
yeah, I mean, a lot of lines, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: lines are, you know, um, I guess I would
call them like S1R or F1R, F1 reversals,
[SPEAKER_01]: F2 reversals, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually how we denote it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, it's kind of like if you use
a shitty line and you keep crossing it
[SPEAKER_01]: out, even if it's a regular line,
you're going to get shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with S1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you keep reversing a plant that kind of
sucks and has some shitty traits,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just going to get more and more
obvious as you go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so have you ever seen a plant come
from an S1 that was better than the
[SPEAKER_02]: parent?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I kind of looked into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't see an obvious, you know,
well-known clone only that was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, S1 that was better than the
parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, OGKB probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if that is an S1 of the forum,
I would say that's a perfect example of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause the interesting thing around that is
I think the guy who found that one claims
[SPEAKER_02]: that it was from the same seed stock as
like the original Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, like they, that the forum
cut would be a sister, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that would make it an S1 of something
because it was, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, it would be, yeah,
I mean, the same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the, I, when I reversed, uh,
Bubba and we did a large population,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was one phenotype in it that was a
narrow leafed type Bubba plant and it had
[SPEAKER_01]: big, um, apical buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just one main Mary stem, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, as opposed to being a short squat
little plant, it had, it was tall and had
[SPEAKER_01]: big colas and it smelled like Bubba tastes
like Bubba, but the high was so much more
[SPEAKER_01]: complex, lasted longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, everybody seemed to prefer
way over the original Bubba and everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: that I know loves the original Bubba.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's another example of an S1 that's
just in my opinion, just outweighed the
[SPEAKER_01]: parent by leaps and bounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, do you think we'll ever see any
more platinum banana OG S1s?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's another good example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the original platinum banana OG was a
great line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there are S1 ones that came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're phenomenal, even better than the
mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so if I do it, I may take one of the
S1s as opposed to the mother and use one
[SPEAKER_01]: of them because they had, like,
some of those were just absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The black, the more black colored ones
that were just had resin caked on it and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and smelled and tasted like banana Laffy
Taffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, if I release it again,
I may, I may release the original mom S1s,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'll definitely do, uh, uh,
an S1 reversal as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, in some of your previous work,
you've worked with some of the more raw
[SPEAKER_02]: land racy type stuff we've spoken about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, uh, one of them I saw was the
chem dog, Colombian gold hybrid you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that, um, these are good
breeding tools, so to speak, or they can
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of make things harder to work
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you think it'll be an ongoing
trend in the future to work with,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like a new school meets old
school hybrid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that one specifically, um,
was work Loompa had done originally,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he brought it down to about 16 weeks,
the hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we, uh, ran an F2 selection and
brought it down to 10 to 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We even had 10 week phenos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, that was one of my favorite
lines, uh, during those years that I ever
[SPEAKER_01]: worked with and worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it didn't sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: People had zero fucking interest in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't OG Kush at the time chem dog D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was not in that big a demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, 91 chem has always been in big demand,
but at the time chem dog D just really
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, you know, people know about star
dog and they know that that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, from the D line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people, more, more people have
been wanting it over the past few years
[SPEAKER_01]: and that shit's long gone now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but that tends to be the trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it takes people a while to catch
up to what a lot of breeders are working
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes several years for them to start
getting hip to land rinks work and what's
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what's your opinion on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your opinion on the chem dog family
as such?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a very popular discussion
topic on our show.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite's Giesel, um, G's diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the mass super scunk crossed to the
chem dog D.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not one of the original, uh,
seeds from the chem dog line that Greg
[SPEAKER_01]: had, but it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it, because if you S1 the Giesel,
you can actually see each one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes of the chem 91.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the D, you can see the four,
you can see the sister all in those
[SPEAKER_01]: reversals of just the Giesel because it's,
because it's so strong with the mass super
[SPEAKER_01]: scunk parent, it's actually very similar
in, in a high smell and looks to the mass
[SPEAKER_01]: super skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, that's, that's why it's one of
my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of the original line, uh, Oh,
I really liked four, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: some people prefer the D for the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't like chem dog D cause it
smelled like baby shit and it just made me
[SPEAKER_01]: really disgusted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in mid flower, it just has this awful
fecal baby shit runny smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was pretty disgusting and foul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your take on naming strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and the reason why I ask is
cause I feel like I can kind of spot your
[SPEAKER_02]: name sometimes of the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is though, you don't seem to go
by like, you know, the standard
[SPEAKER_02]: nomenclature where it's like, you know,
blueberry crossed to OG, call it blue OG
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever, you know, what's your
approach to naming strains and how do you
[SPEAKER_02]: feel about that whole nomenclature?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned where, you know, people are
just kind of ramming two names together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, early I would do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was like the top popular
nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was what people did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it was a blue haze, if you call it
blue haze, you know, um, if it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry bubble gum, it was bubble berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I don't know, I don't know how I
come up with any of the names I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are just fucking pull out my
ass or it's a punk rock Ken's name or I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, I'm reckless with naming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made a lot of stupid names,
stuff that I don't like and I don't keep
[SPEAKER_01]: in the end and some stuff that I just keep
cause I'm too lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though it sucks, but I have
learned that sometimes a name is
[SPEAKER_01]: everything when it comes to a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I probably should pay more attention to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't care on that part.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes down to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we don't routinely at least or ever
see you attend cannabis cups or events
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do you just avoid them because
of kind of, you know, all the previous
[SPEAKER_02]: interactions with people or you just don't
see the real value in going to them?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've gone like the ones in Denver,
um, the first few years I went to the ADSI
[SPEAKER_01]: cup when I went that year, I don't ever
have trouble with anyone cause people were
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking usually all talk online and
pussies in the person, but, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fucking assholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I call them high crimes cause all
they are is one big long fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: advertisement for bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I don't really have any purpose of
going to the cups and giving them money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's other cups like the Emerald
cup and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't go this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just cause I was dealing with a lot of
chaos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, same thing the year before,
but, uh, Bodhi always tries to get me to
[SPEAKER_01]: go to those with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, that's the only reason I
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just because it's usually life
shit going on at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other cups, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess a lot of the people that go into
those are a lot of the newbie shit heads
[SPEAKER_01]: that are trying to prove something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've already been there, done that and
don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need an award to satisfy my ego.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think, you know, what's one of
maybe the most unexpected friendship in
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry being yourself and Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of our listeners really,
really dig Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they'd be interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you meet him and, you know,
develop this friendship over time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, um, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and Bodhi, how do we meet?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we were just both making seeds at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was doing it before I was even.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we've just always kind of gotten along
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's obviously like my polar opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very quiet, very reserved,
super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never has anything negative to say about
anyone ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he's really sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and him, when we talk, we don't even
really talk about cannabis that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he has pretty good knowledge of punk
rock history and vinyl.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get along talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one of those things where we are
polar opposites, but we totally get along.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really weird pairing and same with
Lumpa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lumpa is very much like Bodhi,
very calm, quiet, reserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just one of those things, you know,
they get me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somehow ying to the yang.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and, and, and, and when people attack
them, they'll just back down because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're nice and they don't care to get
into it and I'll just rip into people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just kind of works out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so would you ever see yourself doing a
collaboration with either them or just
[SPEAKER_02]: other breeders you, you know, you thought
positively of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I've done collaborations
with Lumpa earlier last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were going to do a seed bank together,
but just a lot of stuff happened with his
[SPEAKER_01]: company and someone trying to screw him
over, um, really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that kind of got put on hold for
awhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, me and Bodhi do do a lot of stuff
together, but it's more like passing
[SPEAKER_01]: clones back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll work with each other's
cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I work with this purple unicorn cut,
and I think I'm the only person that works
[SPEAKER_01]: with that specific cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's some of Jojo's work crossed a chem
dog D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, you know, that's, that's,
that's pretty much how we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I give them a lot of my land race
lines that I collect over the years that,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I don't have a lot of outdoor space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just give them to him to run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And would you ever be interested in,
you know, going and doing the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, machete in one hand,
hacking through Amazonian jungles to get
[SPEAKER_02]: your own land race?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you not really interested in that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I don't have that ability to just walk
away from my plants and leave them and
[SPEAKER_01]: trust someone to take care of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really, really paranoid about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't really do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't leave a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: To go on big adventures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, that would be putting my company
at risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just kind of, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, but it would be nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: What plan have you had for the longest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, we have the clockwork orange mom,
the longest, I would have to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's probably the one that's survived
the longest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not the original one from Doug,
but the, cause that wasn't called
[SPEAKER_01]: clockwork orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just an Alaskan ice plant of some
sort, but the one that became known as
[SPEAKER_01]: clockwork orange, that one stayed the
longest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's not through any,
um, awesomeness of my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've passed it to other people and had to
get it back from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been very fortunate that the
people I've passed it to have gotten,
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten her back to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I guess you maybe answered
indirectly, but you no longer hang onto
[SPEAKER_02]: that original Alaskan ice plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, we lost that early, early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, after we made some of the first rounds
of seeds with it, trying to get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: that crinkle phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we thought, well, that's pretty
ugly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no real reason to keep the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we have the seeds, we can pick a
better phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't have that crinkle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just wasn't the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for some reason, the crinkle goes hand
in hand with the potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you feel about the whole
organics versus synthetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like where do you sit in the
growing spectrum?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I use what I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, any, to me it's, it's like,
you know, some people are diehard
[SPEAKER_01]: organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are diehard TLO, like my
buddy, the rev, like he's the T I think
[SPEAKER_01]: he's like the T L O master.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's, he knows what he's talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's taught so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people, um, I, I'm sponsored by
botanic care and a few other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, uh, you know, there's some
synthetics in the lines, but I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even care if it's a bottle of N,
a bottle of P and a bottle of K.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, whether it's organic or inorganic,
I can look at the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way every girl should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, no matter what they use,
they should just be able to look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, know exactly what the plant needs,
not overfeed and just, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: feed according to what the plant desires.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know, that's about where I
stand on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty indifferent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so like, do you, do you find that
you can get a pretty consistent product
[SPEAKER_02]: from either or is there one method that
you just personally kind of prefer?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, I, I, I cross both boundaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just depending on what I'm using,
I usually use some organic stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: inorganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, but I mean, as long as you
know your plant, you know what it wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually you'll get the same standard,
uh, the same standard buds, as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: your environment's pretty stable,
other than the feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think is the future of
growing then?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like we've seen some pretty
major innovations in terms of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like mammoth pea was like kind
of something people might list or even
[SPEAKER_02]: say, looking at lighting technology like
Gavita.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think are some of the new
things that are going to roll onto the
[SPEAKER_02]: scene in the next couple of years that
might be game changers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I think, I think big pharma
coming in, sweeping through California,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the lobbyist to pass the laws here
and fuck all the growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably the biggest game
changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think a lot of us that are,
that are pioneers in the business,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get screwed out of our
companies and, um, kind of our careers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would probably be the biggest game
changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that'd be a defeat for a lot of
people who have been fighting since the
[SPEAKER_01]: sixties long before I was involved,
uh, to, to get this legal correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as technology, I mean, I mean,
Gavita and the double ended bulb have made
[SPEAKER_01]: huge leaps and bounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I use Solistex, uh, double ended
stuff and it's been, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's night and day compared to just
the normal HPS or metal halide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so where does CBD fit into Riot seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I don't think we've seen
many or even any CBD strains from you
[SPEAKER_02]: guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it something you want to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, we've, we've released a few CBD
lines, but the thing I've had a hard
[SPEAKER_01]: problem doing is when I, when I make CBD
lines, I don't like to charge a lot for
[SPEAKER_01]: them, but they cost just as much to
produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not, I'm not a big operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not some massive fucking world,
you know, multi warehouse operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I can just afford to take big hits
on one and then charge a bunch for
[SPEAKER_01]: another, um, CBD work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, it benefits so many people,
a lot of them, children, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: with Alzheimer's, a lot, you know,
kids with seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really, really hard for me to even
charge anything, let alone a small amount
[SPEAKER_01]: for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just try to do small projects
enough to where I keep enough in stock to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to give it away when I want,
or, you know, if someone doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily have an ailment, but just want
to try it, they can buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, how do you feel about the
whole THC to CBD ratio?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you know, do you think that there's
an optimum ratio or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just pure CBD is best in terms of like,
you know, the medical properties of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I genuinely think that's,
that's, that depends on the individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, cannabis, even, even in its
medical aspects as a, as an individual
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, um, you'll see some people
saying, you know, the THC helps a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: their cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're, they're cancerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, any, anything, their responses,
they're having the medicine that are
[SPEAKER_01]: negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but again, some people say,
you know, that's only the CBD stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: helps me, that helps my pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of people only help by THC
from pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, really like in generally
speaking, uh, it's hard to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's all an individual experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some, some people more helped by a high
THC to CBD ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people were helped by a higher CBD
ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: The THC ratio on some are helped more by
that even one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's just so hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think until the science is
ready to show what, what body chemistry
[SPEAKER_01]: works with what best then that we'll ever
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all an individual type thing.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you mentioned earlier,
you're good friends with the Rev.
[SPEAKER_02]: You seem to get featured in Skunk a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any particular relationship with
him you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that just a thing where he thinks
you've got good strains and therefore,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it gets featured or is it more
of like a business type deal where he's
[SPEAKER_02]: being paid for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've never paid for anything with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they, they, Skunk is one of the few
magazines that I've been, I've,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been really, really vocal about
liking because the one they've never asked
[SPEAKER_01]: me for a dime, never ever, never have
asked me for a dime.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't ask me for anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they feature everyone that's in there
is featured on merit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because they're paying for ads.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because they're doing this or
that like high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not paying for parties for high
time shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not paying for awards.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in there on merit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the ones making the waves in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, the Revs, I've gotten along with
them so well for a long time just because
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we talk, we're not, we don't talk
regularly, but maybe once a month or twice
[SPEAKER_01]: a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually it's just about what we're
working with at the time, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, I mean, they feature my
stuff because they feel it's on merit that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the one making the waves in the scene
at that particular time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a few months where I
won't be in it because I'm not,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love, I love the fact that it's,
it's unbiased in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people in there that I can't stand
that are making waves, but they don't care
[SPEAKER_01]: if I can't stand them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't have, I don't have the
ability to influence their opinion on
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so on a bit of a similar topic,
there, there's a lot of controversy around
[SPEAKER_02]: that whole attitude seed bank incident
where there was other photos for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, representing the riot strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's, what was your take on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened there?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the, the, the photo they're referring
to is for Skunko's work with blood rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, uh, Heath Robinson's black
rose was up there as a picture,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was one of the moms from Heath
himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that wasn't really that big of a deal
with the attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I told him, I said that this is
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Skunko just told me, take it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They took it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened with the attitude?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's a, it was a, it was a two
tiered thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first one was, when we were up
there, me and sub cool TGA were the only
[SPEAKER_01]: Americans on that side at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not gauge, not Hayes, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the one that brought them on later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but just me and sub cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't really know sub cool from
anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know his, his husband,
Mr. Jill at the time either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they emailed the girl, I believe her
name was Natalia at the time and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy's an asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he's on here, we don't want to be on
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time they were making the most
money for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't making that much money for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the chick emailed me and
said, you know, sub cool is one of my good
[SPEAKER_01]: friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said that you guys are not nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to talk about what we can do
to, to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you email them and kind of be nice to
them and be kissy kissy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, no, fuck them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing shit anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of stuck in her head that I
wouldn't work with her that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just go kiss his ass for no good
reason or his wife's husband, whatever it
[SPEAKER_01]: is, his ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the other, the other problem was
that at the time, uh, Gage, we had just
[SPEAKER_01]: started this company and Hayes man were on
my site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, uh, because they were both friends
and Hayes man had just left, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: making seeds from Moda and they had asked
me to sell their seeds for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have an outlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, okay, I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was selling their seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the attitude originally picked me
up, I said, I will come on, but only if
[SPEAKER_01]: you bring these two guys with me,
because when I go up, I want my friends to
[SPEAKER_01]: go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just how it goes, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time I was also trying,
I was put, I was pushing Bodie so hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: go on the attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't really want to at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because he approaches everything very
cautiously and he's smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's smarter than I was.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what damn sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I got Gage on there and Hayes
man, and they picked up five packs from
[SPEAKER_01]: each, just an easily five pack order,
but they, they agreed that that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: they would do at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they sold well, then they pick up
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, great, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I didn't make a dime off of their
cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point was to get them on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then Gage sent me an email and said,
Hey man, I would love your contact at the
[SPEAKER_01]: attitudes email address.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could thank her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, okay, well whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not making any money off you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a shit if you go around my
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was obvious what he was doing,
but I didn't care because I wasn't making
[SPEAKER_01]: any money off of him, but that's not what
he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: He emailed her and said, yeah,
I don't know what this Matt guys told you
[SPEAKER_01]: about me, but you know, he's kind of a
shit head and he's like completely buried
[SPEAKER_01]: me to her.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only was I buried by sub cool,
then I was buried by him, my own friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed friend at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when the attitude were just,
they, uh, Italian started writing me nasty
[SPEAKER_01]: emails and I called her a dumb bitch and
that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: End of story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is that kind of the origins of the
whole Gage Green dispute or does it trace
[SPEAKER_02]: back more to Jojo Rizzo's stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I, Jojo was a friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a friend of, uh, my friend in CGA
North NorCal Grows Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a friend of a lot of ours and not a
lot of us knew the whole true story about
[SPEAKER_01]: how he had overdosed, who, who had given
him the stuff to overdose on and where all
[SPEAKER_01]: of his seed stock went.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over time we started to learn more and
more as Gage would fucking let little bits
[SPEAKER_01]: out, little bits of info out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he'd say, oh yeah, I got this,
I think it's like, nobody else had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't pass it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: How the fuck did you get that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and a little bit by bit the
story would come out, but that was,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was almost the end of our friendship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did that with me in Italian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, even then I gave him another chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, dude, that was kind of fucked
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What'd you do that for?
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't very nice of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he apologized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, a few months later I
get an email from someone saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, this guy's burying you to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, just a random customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sure?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hit up Gage again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what the dude, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like talk to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you pissed about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, he'd say, no,
no, I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually it happened again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I confronted him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, yeah, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a fucking asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he continued to bury me from then on
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just kind of stayed cool for a while
and just figured I'd catch him out and
[SPEAKER_01]: about and slapped the shit out of him,
calm them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's hard to catch, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's hard to catch out of places.
[SPEAKER_01]: He runs pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's, that's about where he's
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old bald headed Heisenberg looking
motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess the same thing with the
subquadrama, you know, I guess that all
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of extended from that initial
attitude incident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I didn't really know them that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I didn't give a shit about their
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were working with Brothers Grimm
stuff, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brothers Grimm already did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were just rehashing old Brothers
Grimm work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have any respect for them because
of what they did to Sonny Chiba.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I didn't really know
them personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't give a shit to attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I weren't saying anything about him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know them personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after they did that, you bet your ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned about them and fucking made sure
and raised hell with them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could fuck with my business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You fucking my livelihood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time I was helping my grandma
who had Alzheimer's fucking pay for her,
[SPEAKER_01]: her nursing home bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, that was like all of my
money was going to that and they cut into
[SPEAKER_01]: that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: They made it really hard for me to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took that personal and I still take
it personal to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an asshole like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep wretches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, you mentioned Heath
Robertson and the blood rose earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I found a post online where Heath
says that, you know, essentially you
[SPEAKER_02]: initially came to him at some point and
asked for some of his genetics saying you
[SPEAKER_02]: were going to be doing a medical type
project, which I think is the one you were
[SPEAKER_02]: referencing earlier in the episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that, is that really what happened or
is that story just a bit complicated?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I, when I first talked to him,
that was what we talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he found out I had original
Apollo 13 F1 lines from brother scrim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause originally he wasn't going to do
anything with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, Hey dude, how about you send me
those seeds and I'll send you like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a hundred of the black rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Send him those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had an intermediary, this dude
named Osso green, who works for insane
[SPEAKER_01]: seed posse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that guy was a fucking another piece
of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Him and Heath were fucking butt buddies,
like on the real butt buddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so those two, those two just
basically fucked me over really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't send me shit, but skunko had
already gotten more black rose seeds from
[SPEAKER_01]: a pot pimp.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dude rips that that's another
accurate name for that dude rips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he had gotten those seeds from him and
that's where I didn't even make the
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't even make the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't work the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had nothing to do with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was never releasing it for skunko,
but yeah, no, I did try to get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't make the seeds from him
originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were going to try to work with them
and do stuff with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Shanty Baba worked with us back
then and Ernesto from Buddha seeds worked
[SPEAKER_01]: with us back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Delta night labs worked with us back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm still friends with all those guys
to this day, all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were all happy with what we did
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only people who weren't happy were
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I contacted everyone in California
to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rascal Rascal still thought shit like he
knows anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, him was Rascal and he's Robinson
turned to be out turned out to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest dickheads out of all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what was the deal with Rascal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, he was also someone who
claims that you stole his photos of your
[SPEAKER_02]: strains in that same part of the Heath
Robinson thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fucking brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've never at that point,
I'd never even grown anything of Rascal's.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had been growing clone only stuff for
the most part that we were working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know why you would claim that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that you used some of his photos
of his plants for your strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, that's that's pretty fucking
impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the only the only photo that ever got
used was one of Heath Robinson's and that
[SPEAKER_01]: was for skunk was lining.
[SPEAKER_01]: He passed me the fucking picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, and the second I found that
out, I was like, OK, take this shit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but but Rascal, no, you know,
the only thing you ever had to fucking do
[SPEAKER_01]: is you got an email from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You told me to fucking kiss his ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, all right, dude, later.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my only interaction with that piece
of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he still runs his dick sucker all the
time now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually that's busy working on
Swerve's fucking knob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to have to edit all this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Only if you want me to.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, don't edit anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so where does Swerve fit into things
then?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, he's just a runt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's just he's just a loud mouth asshole.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's nothing special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even dislike Swerve.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel bad for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he'd make quite an ass out of
himself over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pity the guy, but he's never done
anything bad to me other than top shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, plenty of people do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people seem to hold a bit of a
grudge about the comments you made about
[SPEAKER_02]: Outlaw when he was arrested, you know,
in that whole situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, would you do anything
differently if you could do that one
[SPEAKER_02]: again?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I say?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, he's still a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a piece of shit then.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a piece of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a piece of shit now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I said I specifically said it
sucks when anybody gets arrested for this
[SPEAKER_01]: plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't wish that on anyone, but the guy's
a cocksucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I don't have any sympathy for
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm risking the same shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's risking the same shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know what we're risking,
especially back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it wouldn't have made me any
less of a jerk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why it would make him any
less of a jerk to now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't change anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess maybe a question to tie up
this little segment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The current cannabis community would
largely be described on Instagram at least
[SPEAKER_02]: as, you know, full of drama and
backstabbing and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like this is an accurate
statement or do you feel like there's
[SPEAKER_02]: always been ongoing dramas and feuds?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, I mean, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for me, there's always been
ongoing dramas and feuds, but I'm one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the few people who will snap back at
people or say anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you don't see Bodhi in a lot of
dramas or feuds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see, I mean, there's it doesn't
really happen to him, but that's because
[SPEAKER_01]: he's so fucking nice and he's hard to get
ahold of to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to be really accessible and that's
that's been a hard part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as Instagram goes, though,
like, I mean, if you see my Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mostly post pictures or records.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are assholes on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, it's just getting worse
because there's a lot more people involved
[SPEAKER_01]: in the scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, back then there were probably a
hundred of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's tens of thousands of people
calling themselves breeders and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: worse and worse every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all little back biters like
you're talking about Gromer, Grover,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever his name is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's I mean, he's all up in that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all those guys, the only reason
I know their names is because all the shit
[SPEAKER_01]: talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, more power to them makes
them happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's the way they want to spend their
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I guess a bit left field
of all the previous questions,
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of questioned in my mind,
how come you don't have any Gorilla Glue
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like a strain you'd breed with,
but I couldn't seem to see any.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a conscious decision?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was a conscious decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: One being that my friend Jason from Dark
Horse, he went out of his way to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: and get the right rights from the breeder
to be the one who worked with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jason worked hard to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I respect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to step on his toes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's one of my friends, you know,
and that was that was pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm helping him make the S1s in a way
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, there's work, but it's not it's
not my hands on work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was originally going to be,
but now it's just mostly advisement on how
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the S1s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you feel about all the other
brands who offer S1s of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: given that information we've just learnt
about the exclusivity rights?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's up to them if they want to
do that or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to make friends or they want
to make enemies, that's up to them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't stab my friends in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're not friends with him and
they think that's OK, then that's up to
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, Jason has a lot of friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a lot of friends like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a lot of friends and it just
all backfires eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's up to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you ever do you ever want to get
any of your lines and try to take them to
[SPEAKER_02]: like a true breeding point, like maybe an
extended BX project or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some kind of IBL?
[SPEAKER_01]: The right very is already at that stage
towards true breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all the crosses we are making
with it now are from the true breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: stance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why almost every right very crosses
purple and blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which generation are they at?
[SPEAKER_01]: F7.
[SPEAKER_01]: The right very made it to F7 and that's
where we stopped it because that was any
[SPEAKER_01]: anything further than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just not doing anything extra to
the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as IBL, that's that's quite a heavy
undertaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know any IBLs that are true IBLs,
deep chunk maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even that has a green phenotype and a
purple phenotype, which means it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: true IBL.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to get an IBL and cannabis is is
not I can't say it's not achievable,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've never seen it fucking happen
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I want to go down that
path of frustration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you grow just for personal
use, are you like more of a few strains
[SPEAKER_02]: like you get in some variety or you're
just like a one or two strain guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I always have a lot of variety and I
prefer a lot of Southeast Asian for
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so what are some of your favorites?
[SPEAKER_01]: The right real line would be one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly tie dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The original Santa Cruz Blue Dream,
again, tie dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just because that that works with my
my chemical, my chemical body type,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it just it's happy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nick has tended to press me and make
me depressed and anxious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hazes don't really make me anxious,
but they I don't know, just it's not my
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very specific to the Southeast Asian
stuff for myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you could only name one,
what's your favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: For personal smoke, it would be the Riot
Berry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't end my day because I,
you know, I run a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to stay awake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what I tend to like to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so would you consider the Riot Berry
or the Clockwork Orange to be more kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of, you know, the the thing that comes to
mind when people think of Riot Berry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Riot seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, I think everybody associates
a Clockwork Orange with us just because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been around the longest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the rarest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it sells for 20 grand a shot,
you know, and that's that's always been a
[SPEAKER_01]: big thing with us for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had the record in California selling for
five hundred an ounce like constantly and
[SPEAKER_01]: never going for under that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was only sold by the ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was never sold by the pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it had a lot of really special things
to associate with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish Riot Berry would probably be more
popular associated with this because I did
[SPEAKER_01]: more work with it and worked harder on it
and I think achieve more in a breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think overall Clockwork Orange is
probably associated with this more.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, and what's what's like an upcoming
project that you're personally really
[SPEAKER_02]: excited for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to do more work with our
Platinum Banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's only been released maybe a
few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did the S1 a few times and we did the
BX1 project, but there's a lot more to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot more to do with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been really stoked with the East
Coast Sour Diesel Strawberry Cream Cross
[SPEAKER_01]: using that in a bunch of lines because
it's just it's like it's it's been really
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable at all of its outcrosses being
keepers to someone at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all really phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of a surprise because
diesel is very picky and usually not
[SPEAKER_01]: predictable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Strawberry Cream Cross to it for
some reason gave it a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: predictability and it was pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what's one of the strains that,
you know, if you could only pick one that
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd really love to get back in your
library that's been lost either by you
[SPEAKER_02]: personally or just everyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, that's a hard one.
[SPEAKER_01]: San Diego Purple Trainwreck was really
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a specific cut of Purple
Trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is before DNA was releasing their
Purple Train or whatever the fuck they
[SPEAKER_01]: called it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just across from there and it was
just really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It almost had like that tie tie pie from
the train wreck side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was just really, really,
really happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you smoke the resin from it,
it would if you smoked enough of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would give you almost like tracers like
acid has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, you mentioned earlier
before selling clones, you're one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: few readers who I've seen, you know,
openly kind of selling clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel that's something that other
breeders should do or is it just something
[SPEAKER_02]: you're just kind of taking advantage of
because no one else is?
[SPEAKER_01]: No one should do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, hell no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody should do that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave it up to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, like there's been times where
I like like where I was moving and I
[SPEAKER_01]: backed up my whole room like five times
over, so I didn't want to lose anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a lot of shit left over because
I didn't lose a single plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, my God, what the fuck
am I going to do with all this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so I was like, oh, well,
I'll just put up some for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if any breeders want to get a hold of
this stuff that they normally wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: even have a shot at getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a lot of good responses from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now when people see, like, that I'm
working with something, they'll make me an
[SPEAKER_01]: offer on what, you know, whatever they
think it's worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I think it's worth sending it to
them for that amount and going through the
[SPEAKER_01]: hassle of fucking shipping and all that
shit, that'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, then it won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't see a lot of breeders
doing that because a lot of breeders are
[SPEAKER_01]: working with stuff that you can go buy at
collectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be pointless.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, how do you feel about the whole
concept of kind of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say clone hoarding,
but like, you know, really not giving
[SPEAKER_02]: clones out to many people at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like that's more positive than
it is negative or it's just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to be really, really stringent
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if someone asked me, like,
don't pass this out, it never goes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's why I have the connections
that I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never break that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I, you know,
Clockwork Orange, I kept that back from so
[SPEAKER_01]: many people and I've almost lost it so
many times that I was like, OK,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is getting kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to end up losing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I stopped doing all that shit just
for my own personal shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too easy to lose shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so out of all the strains you've tried
over the years, what's the worst?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God, probably something I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a it was a it was DeShamen's
Purple Widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was it was just like I was fucking
around with auto flowering shit at the
[SPEAKER_01]: time for no reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just seeing what would happen
across to Lowrider.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the worst shit I've ever seen
in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DeShamen Purple Widow in the first
place auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it shouldn't have made any seeds,
but seeds were left over and I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I'll try this shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fucking horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was as bad as any like brick shwag I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was responsible for that madness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the worst strain ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, like just touching on
Lowrider, how do you feel about autos?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it something you'd ever look into or
no?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I released a few lines, but it was only
because I was trying to fill a void in the
[SPEAKER_01]: market and the American market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, I don't I wasn't happy with
any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were happy with them that grew
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, real growers aren't going to
be happy with that to grow real strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not it's never going to be the
same or equal as long as you're using a
[SPEAKER_01]: root or Alice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I was like an aspiring breeder
nowadays and I really wanted to learn how
[SPEAKER_01]: to breed and watch selection and and and
how how progeny comes out, I would I would
[SPEAKER_01]: advise them and go get some regular auto
flowering seeds because they have a very
[SPEAKER_01]: short cycle and you can see selection and
evolution in action a lot faster than you
[SPEAKER_01]: would.
[SPEAKER_01]: But using a normal line just to learn how
out crossing works, learning, selecting
[SPEAKER_01]: traits, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it's good for is training
someone how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about it with that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, like Europeans that have to
grow in like little tiny apartments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm sure they're good for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you mentioned earlier that
like S1ing a clone only can be like a good
[SPEAKER_02]: way to retain the genetics, improve the
vigor and things lost over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like there's any other ways to
improve the, you know, the traits that
[SPEAKER_02]: have been lost over the years or you just
have to S1 it, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, you can also tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's not that's not necessarily
through breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just tissue culture and you can get a
lot of the vigor back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to use a lot of S1ing if I'm not
using it just to make seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it for a lot for parental
identification to see what other
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes are that the parents would have
put out in order to guess the parentage of
[SPEAKER_01]: a line.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also a good use of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, like for getting a vigor
back to a plant, the only things you can
[SPEAKER_01]: really do are S1ing it, out-crossing it
and selecting for a phenotype and then
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilizing that trait through a
successful or successive breeding or
[SPEAKER_01]: through, yeah, S1ing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is tissue culturing something
you're doing at the moment or looking into
[SPEAKER_02]: or you think it's kind of just more of a
dream?
[SPEAKER_01]: We did it early on, very early on,
very, very early on before anybody was
[SPEAKER_01]: like selling kits or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very fucking hard to do because we
did it in a normal house without fucking
[SPEAKER_01]: fume hood, without any kind of HEPA
filtration system and it was not very
[SPEAKER_01]: successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was very, very little success
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time I've tried it since,
it's been similar spotty stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have friends that have done it
successfully without all that stuff and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know how they did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They must have insanely anal OCD cleaning
abilities and not like I'm wearing masks
[SPEAKER_01]: and shit, but I think it's a great thing
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, you really need a lab setting to
be able to do it successfully and make it
reliable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we see like, you know, these kits
where you can take little cuttings of
[SPEAKER_02]: leafs of little seedlings and get
determined their sex and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that this rise in kind of our
use of scientific tools and techniques is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to continue to rise or they're just
like kind of a moving fad and we'll always
[SPEAKER_02]: do things kind of the way we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I really do think that tissue
culturing is going to be the ideal way of
[SPEAKER_01]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can store so many samples in
such a small area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with much less light, I mean,
it is the ideal method as long as you have
[SPEAKER_01]: a clean space, but as HEPA filtration and
lab settings get cheaper, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll probably see people more doing that
more than cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as for right now, I mean, cloning is
just so easy to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see that changing in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lucky last question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could go and get one, oh,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go and get some land-raised seeds
from one period of time from any region,
[SPEAKER_02]: where would it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to go back to China during
some of the earliest, earliest,
[SPEAKER_01]: like man's earliest work with cannabis and
harvesting it and growing it and the first
[SPEAKER_01]: early selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would see what it really looked like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of guesses on
whether it was a broadleafed indica type
[SPEAKER_01]: plant or whether it was a narrowleafed
plant and what exact valley it was from
[SPEAKER_01]: and what it was like, what its early
traits were like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would probably be the ultimate dream
is to see what the first cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_01]: looked like before it went all around the
world and changed its look and form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, sorry, just to clarify,
the kind of the cradle of life is in
[SPEAKER_02]: China, you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's been the scientific
hypothesis since the 70s.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess near the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The mountains, maybe?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or the Golden Triangle, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's either supposed to be that or
like the, yeah, I think the Chinese Yunnan
[SPEAKER_01]: mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some people that say that,
but I think the Golden Triangle is also
[SPEAKER_01]: another place that it could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I think that just about brings
us to the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there any shout outs or comments you
wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think I already talked about
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone else that's helped me along the
way on Right Seeds, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks so much for coming on the
show today, Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like Matt more now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you had a good time with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks again to Organic Gardening
Solutions, 420 Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most importantly, Matt Wright and
Right Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see you.
Bye.
