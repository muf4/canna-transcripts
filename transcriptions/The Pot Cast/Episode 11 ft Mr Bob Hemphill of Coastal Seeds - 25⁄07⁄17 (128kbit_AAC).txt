[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to make a quick announcement
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, some good news.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna have some changes coming to
the show and it's gonna basically result
[SPEAKER_01]: in more content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope everyone's excited for more
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bad news, however, is that SoundCloud
is likely closing down in four weeks or
[SPEAKER_01]: so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people do listen to our show through
SoundCloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I've begun the process of
uploading all of the content onto YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could all remember to go over
and subscribe to our YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can stay up to date.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put a link in the description and you
won't risk missing out on any of the new
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
The Podcast, the cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_01]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode, as always, was brought to
you by 420 Australia, your premier
[SPEAKER_01]: clothing and apparel store, as well as
Organic Gardening Solutions, your one-stop
[SPEAKER_01]: shop for organic gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode, we're thankful to have Mr.
Bob Hemphill on the show to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: coastal seeds, strain preservation,
and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alrighty, so a big welcome and thank you
to a true veteran of the breeding scene,
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob Hemphill of Coastal Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question I like to start off every
interview with is, what was your first
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was summer between ninth and 10th grade
and a friend of mine from the
[SPEAKER_02]: neighborhood, Ron, scored some Mexican
weed and he had this little homemade pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked one day after school at a party
and then we smoked like two or three days
[SPEAKER_02]: later and after that second time we
smoked, I knew I had a big love for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis because the way it just relaxed
me where I grew up in Northern Virginia
[SPEAKER_02]: was high stress area, very competitive,
and just to be able to relax and connect
[SPEAKER_02]: back to nature type of vibe is how I
always wanted to live and it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were the strains kind of floating
around back then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I could only get Mexican and
Jamaican and occasionally Asian or African
[SPEAKER_02]: brickweeds and they were smashed and
mostly sativa and that's where we got our
[SPEAKER_02]: first seeds to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just pulled them out of some of the
first sacks we ever smoked and we just
[SPEAKER_02]: planted the seeds and I had two really
hard knocks years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the first year I just left the plants
in too much shade because I knew I had to
[SPEAKER_02]: hide them and I put them in so much shade
they ended up just falling over and dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second year I grew, I had a plant
growing and I had it flowering and I
[SPEAKER_02]: literally brought it inside because of a
frost warning and stuck it under 24 hours
[SPEAKER_02]: of light because I didn't know it was a 12
and 12 light cycle that made it flower at
[SPEAKER_02]: the time and really hard knocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so during that time, were there any
things around like the counter Bible or
[SPEAKER_01]: was this predating that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I guess it goes without saying
you didn't have kind of any family members
[SPEAKER_01]: you could refer to because that's
something I found is a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: commonality between a lot of people we
talk to.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people seem to have at least one
family member who's kind of pushing them
[SPEAKER_01]: along, but you sound like he didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I had a lot of older brothers and
sisters, but none of them grew or really
[SPEAKER_02]: hooked me up with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually the other way around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even from a young age, I was always giving
my older brothers and sisters cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: because after that second time of smoking
it, I knew I wanted it around me all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time and I was hustling it and trying to
grow it from the start.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just so I could get a free sack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, the first two years I
tried to grow it, it was hard knocks,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that third year I left it out and it
was Mexican sativa and I harvested it and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was total citrus,
amazing high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at that time, you know,
Grateful Dead would come around.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was when I was a senior in high
school and that's when I started going to
[SPEAKER_02]: the Grateful Dead shows and actually
people were burning kind of out from
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's most of the first kind of I got
was, you know, going to a Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the first time I actually got my
hands on some kind of seeds was 1995.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right after I harvested that first Mexican
weed that fall at a fish New Year show,
[SPEAKER_02]: I scored some kind of from Humboldt and I
got dank seeds and that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind bud seeds and I grow them and it was
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I, you know, I bred those,
unfortunately Crossbred them to a Southern
[SPEAKER_02]: Virginia strain instead of breeding them,
brother to sister and keeping that line
[SPEAKER_02]: pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that was really quality weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so was that outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, if it was outdoors, did that just
signal in your mind that genetics was the
[SPEAKER_01]: key to you or what, what, what did it
signal to you at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you had kind of this
awakening with cannabis of what was
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the first thing you were thinking
like, fuck, I need to start be doing this
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors with good genetics or like,
you know, like maybe something different,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what were you thinking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I was always getting the
high times magazines and hearing about
[SPEAKER_02]: sensei seeds and, and Neville and all that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the amazing strains they
had and, you know, you know, I knew good
[SPEAKER_02]: bud was out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, being in Northern Virginia
was far and few between, especially for
[SPEAKER_02]: young kids, you know, when you're in high
school, you're low on the totem pole.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just pretty much had to make the
good bud, you know, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the first time I smoked some good Northern
Alliance was Philadelphia Spectrum at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Grateful Dead show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was in the fall of 94 right before
they came and played the Capitol Center
[SPEAKER_02]: and smoking that indoor good Northern
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually from this dude that I knew
from Virginia, but seeing them at a
[SPEAKER_02]: Grateful Dead show, he kind of opened up
more and it was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, at that same time,
you know, everyone was out on a quest to
[SPEAKER_02]: get the best genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a friend of mine who went to
Amsterdam in early 95 and he bought packs
[SPEAKER_02]: of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: He could get his hands on like the most,
you know, everything he could afford.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually got money from another friend
of ours too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those guys, you know, they bought the
four way pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, when we pop that four way,
it was, you know, took stuff over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And me being with those guys, they had
mentors, unlike me, who had taught them
[SPEAKER_02]: how to grow inside and, and run shit,
you know, like not just in a closet,
[SPEAKER_02]: like when a whole basement or a whole,
whole grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was lucky to get with those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the four way pretty much
changed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was like, we, we had that and
it was like, there wasn't much better at
[SPEAKER_02]: the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only things I remember better was and
I'll hash plant cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that shit was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll hash plant and I'll cheat 13
cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, that, that cross used to come
around to Northern Virginia and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: called the kill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the best weed I've ever
smoked to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember telling the guys, Hey,
we'll trade this four way clone for that
[SPEAKER_02]: kill clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they straight laughed in my face,
you know, they just didn't think it was
[SPEAKER_02]: even a fair trade at all where the four
way was a lot of people considered the
[SPEAKER_02]: best weed they ever smoked in our life.
[SPEAKER_02]: This kill was that much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to this day, the only thing that I
can, you know, it reminds me of is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, chem dog and it was very loud
and just very crystal and amazing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in regards to the four way,
do you think that that pack was a lucky
[SPEAKER_01]: pack or like, this was just at a time
where Sensei was so good that every pack
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially had a clone that good in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Sensei was really good in the early
nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I remember anyone that got a pack,
you know, found some good shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they didn't keep the clones because
it was hard at that time to keep clones,
[SPEAKER_02]: but everyone that was getting stuff,
stuff was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really think that four way was,
you know, very special because other crews
[SPEAKER_02]: in Northern Virginia told me they bought
several packs and never found anything
[SPEAKER_02]: near as close.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing wasn't very skunky and pretty
stony.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm very just loud flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the four way has got some
interesting genetics in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, specifically the Paki and the
Indian, you know, we see Paki a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more common than Indian, but you know,
you rarely see Indian at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just mentioned it's skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do those other genetics really
influence it too much?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you think that, so you mentioned
it's very skunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you notice any Indian influence or do
you think maybe that's what makes it more
[SPEAKER_01]: skunky than the others, so to speak,
like some weird interplay between the two?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a really complex strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, you know, describe it as like
a buttery smell when you're breaking it up
[SPEAKER_02]: and then like a starburst smell and just
kind of sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from like 10 feet away, if you have a
bag in your pocket, it just rakes like
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like if you brought it into a
two story house, the people in the second
[SPEAKER_02]: story house would say, damn this shit,
what the fuck, who killed a skunk type of
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember one time I had long dreadlocks
and I was, you know, waiting in line on a
[SPEAKER_02]: gas station and the guy kept asking
everyone in line who hit the skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I literally had to bite my lip just to
not laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I finally, you know, got to the cash
register and he's like, someone really hit
[SPEAKER_02]: a skunk out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't believe the guy never thought
that this dread head has a fucking sack of
[SPEAKER_02]: weed in his fucking pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he really thought someone had hit a
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just in terms of the whole
timeline, of things, did the roadkill
[SPEAKER_01]: skunk exist at this time or was this
before or after it had come onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: scene?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I remember seeing skunk number one a
few times in, you know, 94, 95,
[SPEAKER_02]: 96.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was always a more citrus town,
never allowed skunk, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, only skunk number one
clones I know of people that saved is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the Las Vegas lemon skunk and
then the UK cheese and the other them
[SPEAKER_02]: smell like skunk either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying there wasn't skunk phenos
and skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying I personally never saw
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the opinion that the roadkill
skunk was possibly an Afghani,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what we've heard frequently on
the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, every time I smelled something
skunky, it was, yeah, a strong indica
[SPEAKER_02]: cross for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the other cuts you hang on
to and I see regularly on your feed is the
[SPEAKER_01]: black domino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this one that is kind of equally as
good as the four-way or do you think maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: it's almost as good, but not quite as
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, like if anything's within
the ballpark of the four-way, then,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's like, it's probably going
to be elite nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, to be honest with you about the
four-way, the only reason I'm keeping it
[SPEAKER_02]: alive is because of a special connection
with it and what I hope it can produce in
[SPEAKER_02]: its offspring.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I'm seeing over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always been a good producer for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the black domino cuts I have are old
Sensi stock and they're much stronger than
[SPEAKER_02]: the four-way potency wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I prefer them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm always looking for any
black domino cut I can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one that's 1995 Sensi seed
selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got from the nature farmer and I got
another one up in Southern Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was held at a harvest, a healing
harvest farmers market held by the guys
[SPEAKER_02]: that hold Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was actually their vending booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I walked by with a friend and we'd
seen that they had black domino for sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm like, oh, I want a
black domino.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, well, you know,
get to the end of the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I turned around and the line's like,
you know, 50 feet long.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, go wait in the end of the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're talking about weed the
whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would get to the end of the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he tells me they're sold out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm like a little,
you know, heartbroken.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friend, he's a real smooth talker.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, you know, can you go look?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy goes and looks and he's like,
oh my God, there's one last one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we just start giving each
other high fives and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I was told, the only thing I was
told about it before I got in line is it's
[SPEAKER_02]: old Sensi seed stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if it's kept around in
Humboldt County and it's old Sensi seed
[SPEAKER_02]: stock, it's, you know, it's a winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, yeah, both of them have a very
narcotic stone, which I prefer in a bud
[SPEAKER_02]: because I like something that'll relax me
and calm me down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a mix of Pacific Northwest hash
plant, Northern line, Ortega and Afghani
[SPEAKER_02]: number one, which is originally known as
M10, the land race Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the Super Sativa Seed Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what males do you think partner well
with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you mentioned it's really narcotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think that, for example,
crossing it to a Sativa would kind of take
[SPEAKER_01]: away from that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to keep it kind of in that indica
dominant realm or not necessarily?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't have any, but I've always
heard that Sensi seeds produce some fire,
[SPEAKER_02]: really good black jack, black dominant
jack hair crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I personally, you know,
got my hands on them and I really was
[SPEAKER_02]: excited to cross them to the Northern
Lights number one male just to keep that
[SPEAKER_02]: old school narcotic indica genac alive in
the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's, you know, that's my most
sought after stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like no one's really offering
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And luckily, Kagu won and the open
pollination NL1 pure line that I had never
[SPEAKER_02]: left the West Coast that he had gotten
from his friend classic seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was able to select a male out of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I popped like 40 and then I
realized how good they were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I popped 95 and selected the best male
out of all those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really went for the side of the gene
pool on the NL1 that was like a spray
[SPEAKER_02]: paint, you know, kind of a chemical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was only I only saw it in about
20% of the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other 80% was your more classic fruity
indica, you know, berry kind of smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I had some good friends up
and we smoked all my chem dogs and all my
[SPEAKER_02]: OGs and actually said they preferred the
turpentine spray paint NL phenols over
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's the type of male I
was going after, you know, tried to match
[SPEAKER_02]: the phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you notice any of those NL
characteristics in the chem dog when you
[SPEAKER_01]: were smoking that or is it more of it was
just like a preference over?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, as far as chem dog,
I always thought chem dog went back to
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, recently now that I've
really got my hands on some really good
[SPEAKER_02]: classic cash plant cuts, I think it's
maybe a combination of the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's just my guess, you know,
just from how I saw we progress,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all the best shit was Northern
Lights crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, chem dog and OG came
on the scene and no one know what they
[SPEAKER_02]: were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's some Afghani
genetics that were similar to that or the
[SPEAKER_02]: same exact genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just out of curiosity, when you
mentioned that Kagu had done the open
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination with the NL1, had he made any
comment about how the plants that you grew
[SPEAKER_01]: out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, was there any little
slight differences between that generation
[SPEAKER_01]: and the previous or do you think that they
were pretty much identical?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like I guess I'm wondering,
even through open pollination techniques,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you think you do get a little bit of
change over time or not really?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, from what I've learned from him,
if you use as many males, as many females,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't bottle neck the genetics that you
can keep everything in seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how he's always done his stuff his
whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: He never really kept clones until,
you know, about 10 years ago, they always
[SPEAKER_02]: just put stuff in the seed so they could
grow it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I wish I had known that in
the early 90s, I'd have a bunch of amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: lines now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in terms of the end product of the
Northern Lights you grew out, have you
[SPEAKER_01]: seen yourself or been given any NL stock
or buds from, you know, any modern
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders that resembled that or was it
just totally different?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to be honest with you, I feel like
most of the Northern Lights genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: disappeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was given some of Sensi stock recently
to grow when I was growing those ones from
[SPEAKER_02]: Kagu1.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some Bodhi Seeds NL and grew them at
the same time and I was very thankful to
[SPEAKER_02]: find that Kagu's NL1 was exactly what I
remembered from a kid and it was so much
[SPEAKER_02]: better than Sensi Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I grew from Bodhi was the NL5
British Columbia Seed Club open
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination and a few other different
crosses that my friend Kelly Depfest gave
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were really good, but none of
them had that narcotic turpentine spray
[SPEAKER_02]: paint phenol.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was really looking for that
I was very excited to find in NL1 because,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we were hoping to use it and it
was exactly what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, how do you think Northern Lights 5
became this massive poster child for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it sounds like Northern Lights 1 was
way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I grew the Northern Lights 1 versus
that British Columbia Seed Club from
[SPEAKER_02]: Bodhi, his NL5 had a way better bag
appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking way better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a more round Nug.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually had more crystals on the
outside of the Nug, but the effect of the
[SPEAKER_02]: NL1 is exactly what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, with that being said about the better
bag appeal on the NL5, do you think that
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of highlights the issue of,
you know, the compromise of quality traits
[SPEAKER_01]: within the plant versus bag appeal over
the years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I moved to Northern California in 97,
there was so much diversity in the weed
[SPEAKER_02]: grunt and Humboldt, Mendo and Trinity
Counties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then right about 2000, everyone had to
have purple or it became a problem to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a few years after that,
you had to have OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you didn't have OG, the buyers
didn't even want to look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, you know, a lot of
people just dropped their old lines and
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone was growing OG or purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are amazing types of weed,
but a lot of genetics were lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a shame.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you think that people drop stuff
out of their head stash rotation,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak, I guess, because what I'm
trying to say is I thought that there was
[SPEAKER_01]: always strains where people always viewed
them as like, this isn't something I can
[SPEAKER_01]: sell, like grow for sale to the masses
because like maybe it's hard to grow or it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't yield well or blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think strains that even fit into
that category were dropped?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I guess my initial instinct is
thinking like, surely some people kept
[SPEAKER_01]: like the really good ones, even if they
just figured like, oh, just grow it for
[SPEAKER_01]: personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest with you, most people don't
keep that good of a mother realm or don't
[SPEAKER_02]: keep strains for long.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the reason I, you know,
got the nickname the librarian.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mostly because I just keep the
strains for all my homies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been doing this forever because
just like when I was a kid, I just wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to have good weed around me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once I have it around me, I just want
to keep it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just take care of these plants and
very dedicated to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there are other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I find these jewels and
trading.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I got on Instagram,
it really helped me gain access to a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of genetics and meeting other people that
kept strains like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but I kept a lot of strains for
my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times, even when they were
just running one strain, they'd come back
[SPEAKER_02]: and get the copy from me after a year or
two, just because I kept a healthier copy,
[SPEAKER_02]: mainly because I never compromised them,
never, you know, there was times where me
[SPEAKER_02]: and Hannibal literally had a bedroom and a
master bedroom, not even in the closet,
[SPEAKER_02]: just in the corner, just because that's,
you know, the kind of commitment I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank God she has it just as hard as
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's actually encouraged me to keep
some of the strains around forever that we
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily don't like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the train wreck is a perfect example
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first, you know, got the strain in
99, you know, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that terpene will get to you after a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of joke about it being train wreck
poison.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on the idea of, you know,
the whole librarian thing, what are some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the more lesser known cuts you keep in
your stash that you think would be well
[SPEAKER_01]: received by the public if they were more
well known?
[SPEAKER_02]: The black Domina, you know, the public is,
you know, different than me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a real serious Indica lover,
you know, and anything that the public
[SPEAKER_02]: really likes, I generally try to have
access to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like a lot of the strong common
Indicas, most people have kind of lost
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like the black Domina, the Northern
Alliance number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't have the real chem
dog D, which is absolutely hands down
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's not many people out
there, you know, producing those,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, then it cuts, you know,
luckily people out there with Incredibles
[SPEAKER_02]: and they got the real deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be amazing for the weed
out in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this idea of the fake chem dog D,
I've heard of this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that there's just like a
bunch of S1s floating around or you're
[SPEAKER_01]: more so referring to the D-cis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a lot of people with the
sister that think it's the D and then
[SPEAKER_02]: there's tons of fakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out in California, if you just go to any
club and you can get any elite,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all on the menus at these clubs
out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But 99 out of a hundred times they're
going to be fake as can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's a million clubs out
here selling chem dog and there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: million fake breeders out there breeding
with chem dog and people never seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like I said, it's kind of limited
and there's only a few people that really
[SPEAKER_02]: grow on commercial, you know, and I'm
mostly grown for head, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just covered on myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we just jump back to that idea
of you maintaining the clones and your
[SPEAKER_01]: friends would come back and grab them from
you because, you know, they couldn't keep
[SPEAKER_01]: it as good as you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got me thinking, what's the shortest
amount of time you've ever seen for a
[SPEAKER_01]: clone to go bad?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, have you seen a clone turned crap in
say like a year because, or does it take
[SPEAKER_01]: like longer than that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's really poorly maintained?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I've selected phenols out
of, you know, seed hunting and phenol
[SPEAKER_02]: hunting and some of those are amazing from
seed or the first clone and they
[SPEAKER_02]: deteriorate fast, you know, and I couldn't
tell you why.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some of these older, you know,
really good clones I have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're very old and they haven't,
you know, degenerate generated as much as
[SPEAKER_02]: other clones that are younger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like I'd say, for example,
four way from 95 has degenerated more than
[SPEAKER_02]: the chem dog 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have the Romulan, 1969 Romulan gel
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, that thing hasn't
degenerated too much at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, you know, it'll, it's a picky
little girl should go on the pre flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: but considering she's going on 50 years
here in a year or two, she's fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, the train wreck is
deteriorating on me pretty hard in these
[SPEAKER_02]: last few years, no matter how healthy I
keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's just genetic,
just like people, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, people age faster than other
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a roll of the dice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just while we're on the topic,
do you think that Romulan Joe's cutting of
[SPEAKER_01]: Romulan is the oldest cut in existence?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think maybe someone's hanging
onto something older?
[SPEAKER_02]: The oldest thing I know of, I'm not saying
that it is the oldest by any means,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I've heard rumors that it might be
even older.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what do you think is the backstory
behind it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what I had heard was that either
Joe or someone he knew was in the Korean
[SPEAKER_01]: war and they brought back some land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just like, you know,
selectively bred to be squat and more
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica, though it was a sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be total bullshit, but I'd love
to hear what you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a squat little Indica
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, you know, it'll dent your
head, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a fucking, it'll fuck you
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's some strong shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like the Brothers Grimm
produced some really excellent stuff with
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Queen.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Killer Queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grow that out soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the Killer Queen is the Airborne
G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I was thinking was, it was,
it was Vickai who made Space Queen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Killer Queen cut I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just acquired the Airborne G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually probably one of the few
things I wasn't able to smoke out of
[SPEAKER_01]: Tommy's collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't think he had any around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he said to me, he reckons it's G13
NL2 or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's what the old forum people
saying, you know, I'm going to believe
[SPEAKER_02]: them and I've not got a chance to flower
it out yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will have it ready, you know,
in a few months here.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got the cut all healthy and cleaned
up and, you know, it takes a few months
[SPEAKER_02]: because I don't like to flower things
right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I don't get a bad impression
generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to kind of do a little bit of
revitalizing yourself before you get it in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I have so many clones and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have that many times to just run
on all new ones unless, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to have them really healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't get a bad impression and give
the clone its fair chance, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get to that revitalizing of clones
because this is something you're very
[SPEAKER_01]: known for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the other kind of guy in the
scene who's well known for this is Kevin
[SPEAKER_01]: Jodry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he often talks about putting the plant
out in the sun to veg, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like not letting it flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause obviously you don't have a clone
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about this and how
important is it to have that sun's role in
[SPEAKER_01]: revitalizing the clone?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the most important thing is to have a
good mother room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking like the everything most
people out here just put into a,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a flower room.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, most people kind of keep their
mom shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I think deteriorates them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want a good amount of light on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want good ventilation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want good humidity levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a lot of bright light to keep
those old clones on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegging.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want them under some weak light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want some serious light over top of
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, some you're going to notice
they like to be off the side a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more, but a majority of the old clones
need a lot of light and a lot of food,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think helps, you know, regenerate these
old clones because a lot of times they
[SPEAKER_02]: have weak root systems, you know,
and it's hard for those old clones to
[SPEAKER_02]: root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they just barely root and they
pop out these weak root systems,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're never going to regenerate without
foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And foliar feed, coconut, aloe,
calcium 25, a lot of compost tea,
[SPEAKER_02]: earthworm stuff, fresh extractions,
and just alternate between all those
[SPEAKER_02]: things to get all the nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's crucial is the foliar
feed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think that helps them,
you know, get the nutrient dense and then
[SPEAKER_02]: your next round of cuttings will be much
healthier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we often hear about specifically
aloe and kelp, having a lot of really
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial hormones in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, more specifically aloe has the
salicylic acid, which stimulates the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's immune system, which in turn has a
big effect on kind of the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: rejuvenation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long do you feel you need to be doing
this before it's going to work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I remember I was talking to Skunk
VA about it and I was like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, you need to start using some aloe to
help rejuvenate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, awesome, I'm going to
start doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the conversation was kind of
like, well, how long do I have to use it
[SPEAKER_01]: before I'm going to start to see effects
and things like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long do you think it would take
through treating a mum really good,
[SPEAKER_01]: giving her all these kind of foliar feeds
and all the good things?
[SPEAKER_01]: When would you expect to start to see some
positive improvements on a sad looking
[SPEAKER_01]: clone, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every clone is different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it'll snap right around at their
first feed foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it'll take a month or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you got to be consistent with putting
those products in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mention the kelp, and the kelp is
huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And dragonfly natural medicines,
natural mystic is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting the alfalfa in there and just
alternating it up so that you get
[SPEAKER_02]: everything in there is, I think,
really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we were to just jump back to how you
were talking about keeping a mother room
[SPEAKER_01]: really healthy, that brought up this idea
in my head of what should you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should you make your mother room a
priority such that you say, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have a smaller mother room
or, for example, less plants in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll try to cater to them better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like that trade off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, all right, well, I won't be
able to keep as many clones, but I'll try
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep the ones I do keep in better
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's kind of a philosophy
you would advocate or do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you cram too many of them in there and
you start making your favorite ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: the special ones, suffer just for a random
clone, so you're shooting yourself in the
[SPEAKER_02]: foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest with you, keeping mothers
like this and all these different clones
[SPEAKER_02]: does not financially benefit at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: People making money are the people who are
monocropping the newest, latest flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you really just keep as many as you can
keep healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I'm pretty ruthless on
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll call them if I don't like them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't keep everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just try to keep the rare things and
everything else I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few close friends around me want to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have about 80 strains that are
certified and I got a bunch of testing
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that raises a bit of a peripheral
idea I've had on my mind for a while now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned the idea of the people
making the money, the ones monocropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've in fact almost come up with my own
little analogy saying at the end of a
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest, you've got two results.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have one, some bud, and you can
maybe sell it for some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can have new clones because you've
grown out seeds and you've pheno hunted
[SPEAKER_01]: them and you sacrifice that monocrop yield
to find your new elite clone, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that in mind, how should people be
rewarded for finding seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people criticize people who want
to charge money for clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, it's like if I spent
a whole cycle running seeds and at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of it, I find one elite clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that same time period, you do a
monocrop and make $30,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it kind of not analogous?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that clone I found kind of not?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've traded a potential 30,000 or whatever
the money value of the crop was to find
[SPEAKER_01]: that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do people get rewarded for that
given that people don't seem to like the
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of people charging lots of money for
clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in my book, anyone that's pheno
hunting is highly respected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anybody that is putting in work to
help progress rather than just ride
[SPEAKER_02]: coattails, rewarded or not, even if they
don't find that amazing, putting in work
[SPEAKER_02]: and helping progress it and save old stuff
should be rewarded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, some of these clones are
worth a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally never sell them, no matter
how much money someone comes at me with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've turned down some ridiculous
amounts, but I'll pay money to buy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll pay money to get them into my
hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at that point, I'll never sell them
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just give them out to friends and
trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that almost kind of suggests we need to
value these community members who are
[SPEAKER_01]: really doing that pheno hunting for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't say give thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they probably deserve a bit more
than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, do you feel that's an issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel the people who are doing the
hard yards in the industry do get the
[SPEAKER_01]: credit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, they do in my book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we should keep it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it old school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And mostly only deal with people that are
new school.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to get into this game now
because it's legal in America and make a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of money because you see dollar
signs and you think it's fun and exciting,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really want to deal with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to deal with the people that have
been risking their lives, putting in work
[SPEAKER_02]: their whole fucking life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of a bit of a final
question on the vigor falling off over
[SPEAKER_01]: time thing in relation to plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that different genetics fall
off at different rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, do you find that there's a
commonality between clones losing vigor in
[SPEAKER_01]: that they tend to lose certain traits
first?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've commonly heard that flavor falls off
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find that's true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you find some strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, like maybe the vigor falls off,
but the flavor is still there or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the flavor and the smell are the
first things to disappear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they'll still get you high,
but they don't taste as magical as they
[SPEAKER_02]: did.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of these strengths I have
from the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, do you think,
you know, so the poster child,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Chem 91 for, you know, kind of not to
give it a bad name because it's still my
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite word, but like, you know,
it's deteriorated over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People say the potency is still the same
though, but wouldn't logic suggest that
[SPEAKER_01]: the potency is reduced because we know
that, you know, the more terpenes there
[SPEAKER_01]: are, the more synergistic that is with the
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, at least the more terpenes,
the more potent it is to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that regard, has it not lost a bit
of potency?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, on my opinion with these old clones,
to make them, knock them out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ballpark to get them, you know,
to their old school vigor and best,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not going to happen every round,
even with a healthy clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like, you know, sometimes I can
knock those old clones out where they're
[SPEAKER_02]: better than anything new.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, you know, it just, it's not as
easy and it's not, you can't do it every
[SPEAKER_02]: round, but it, you know, sometimes they'll
turn out just as good as ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of jumped back a bit in time now.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you first decide you wanted to
start breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first got those kind buds seeds at
that fish show New Year's Eve,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was turning from 94 to 95.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to have more kind buds seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was, you know, I never had a
lot of money and getting a bunch of packs
[SPEAKER_02]: from Amsterdam was, you know, it just,
it seemed like too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to actually get seeds from a sack,
you know, that I buy on a lot,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, was a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I just wanted to keep those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was around and unfortunately I didn't
keep them pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I crossed them to a strain from Southern
Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that was the next year and
those were great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I would have, you know,
kept that lime pure, it would have been
[SPEAKER_02]: something special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good, stony, purple indica,
you know, nice Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when did you make the transition to
indoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got mentored by a couple of friends
that are the guys that actually popped
[SPEAKER_02]: that Fairfax four way seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were really good friends of mine and
they had a house that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I learned how to do it like that,
you know, and, you know, luckily I was
[SPEAKER_02]: taught right from the start, you know,
as far as when to take it inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause my outdoor shit was ridiculous hard
knocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was sucked to do all that inside with
all that risk and power bill and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: back East.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just as a bit of a preview,
what do you think was kind of the silliest
[SPEAKER_01]: thing you guys were doing back there
indoors that you thought was like going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make the plant better, but maybe in
retrospect, are you like, are we thinking?
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest with you, the, those guys
were taught by some, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: people that knew their shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I was able to bring to the
game with them was the use of bat guanos
[SPEAKER_02]: and kelp to help make the weed taste
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of the reason they brought
me in is because they tasted that seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: that I had gotten from that fish show and
they tasted the crosses those two years in
[SPEAKER_02]: a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just grown that shit outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in Northern Virginia, like we're
talking in clover Dales and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the thing in the highway where they
loop to loop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause no one really goes into that
intermediate or along the railroad tracks
[SPEAKER_02]: and some, some fire bushes and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I didn't grow up in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was more like inner city.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get to the capital in 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Washington DC.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as time went by, when was the first
time the chem dog came to you in person?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it was fish tour and, um, it was in
fall tour and, um, we went to
[SPEAKER_02]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot the university and, um,
you know, some of the kids that I'd met on
[SPEAKER_02]: tour were really excited, like,
Hey, when we get the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: mass, we're going to be able to get chem
dog, you know, and be able to get chem dog
[SPEAKER_02]: and fucking, you know, it was,
they just kept talking about it and
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking building it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was fucking, it lived up to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was fucking good ass weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was, uh, 96, the fall of 96 that
tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that selling grilled cheese
sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I counted the money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my friend made them and now they got
buttered bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I also sold, you know,
any weed I could get the whole time,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just to get from show to show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get to the next show.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just have enough money to buy grilled
cheese sandwiches, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm talking, we could get the butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could get the cheese and we could get
the bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we used to turn that into enough money
in the parking lot to get tickets,
[SPEAKER_02]: sack of weed and hotel and gas money to
the next show and just enough money to buy
[SPEAKER_02]: grilled cheese again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that whole time, were you kind of
thinking to yourself, I need to get these
[SPEAKER_01]: chem dog genetics for when I want to breed
with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, to be honest with you, man,
um, I never even thought of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, uh, me and chem dog had a good
friend, um, mutual friend in between us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that dude was a true hustler and he
was smart enough to keep our crew separate
[SPEAKER_02]: because of that way he could get the chem
dog from, um, chem dog and he could get
[SPEAKER_02]: the four away from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he did that and he did that
successfully.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, uh, you know, funny because we
were at a lot of shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think, uh, Hannibal has a
chelum from him from like 90, 96 or 97
[SPEAKER_02]: from my first show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to get a picture of that to him to
see, verify.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause, but it looks identical,
like his old work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And does this guy fit into the history
anywhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is he just kind of a personal friend,
doesn't fit into any other of the story at
[SPEAKER_01]: all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's somebody that I never mentioned
his name, but, um, he's a huge,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, respected guy, friend of
chem dogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, he's the guy that got the 91 and
stuffed one eye, um, who bred the dog
[SPEAKER_02]: walker OG out in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's another, uh, Virginia guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually told me, uh, you know,
the four way is what inspired him to start
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's an honor and it's
cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people claim that, you know,
that was the best weed they've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but boy has she degenerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So scrolling through some of your earlier
posts on Instagrams, we see things like
[SPEAKER_01]: the, I'm going to say this wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the Puna butter cookies?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you say that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Puna, Puna butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so Hawaiian, uh, heirloom strain and,
um, keg, you got those seeds from a friend
[SPEAKER_02]: of his and, um, um, this is before I was
in coastal seeds and he gave them to
[SPEAKER_02]: Bollywood Bam.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bollywood Bam made that cross and,
um, the Puna butters, um, really
[SPEAKER_02]: stabilized the cookies and there's some
fire to be found in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I think we just sold out of the
last packs and that's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully someone will keep a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would you describe the influence of
like Hawaiian land race slash heirloom
[SPEAKER_01]: strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's one of those ones where there's
not a ton of information on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some people say, uh,
Uji Kush comes from the Crippie,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a Hawaiian strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the other hand, you've got
like the Molokai frost, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, another Hawaiian strain,
which doesn't seem to be overly similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: the supposed Crippie.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe, uh, the Hawaiian
land race in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what would you describe that the
Puna butter kind of brings to the cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it stabilizes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't throw many herms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, cookies throws a lot of
herms and the Puna butter cookies,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and our testing throw zero and we sold
a lot of seeds and I'm sure there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: few in there, but we didn't really hear
any complaints ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the main thing it brought to the
table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, KQ really respects those old strains,
you know, um, right before I became the
[SPEAKER_02]: coastal, they lost, uh, the Maui Waui,
you know, and KQ was real sore about that
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The old brotherhood strain and he has high
regard for the Hawaiian heirlooms because
[SPEAKER_02]: he actually got to smoke them in their hay
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I was a young kid on the
East coast, so I really don't know much
[SPEAKER_02]: about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's kind of, I'm seeing some
now they're locally working with coastal
[SPEAKER_02]: and KQ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how would you describe coastal
seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I guess it's kind of differs from
a few companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few people who breed under the
banner of it, but it seems like the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall project is, you know, land race
slash heirlooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: How, how do you think of coastal seeds,
so to speak?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, coastal seeds is Hannibal,
uh, KQ first, he started it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he took, um, Bollywood BAM as the
first people to work with KQ and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, uh, they brought me in and Hannibal
and, and, um, KQ is, uh, an OG,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he's 72 years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been, uh, growing since 1969.
[SPEAKER_02]: So me and BAM just look at him,
uh, you know, just as a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a mentor and, um, you know,
just we're lucky to be able to work with
[SPEAKER_02]: these genetics he has and to help,
uh, help him do this work, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause when you're 72, you know,
life becomes a little harder than when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're in your prime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, he's got all these genetics and
that's actually the main reason I joined
[SPEAKER_02]: just because, uh, he had all these awesome
genetics and I wanted to cross them to all
[SPEAKER_02]: these awesome old clones I had and I
wanted to help them keep these,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, strains pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, soon as I dug into the vault,
you know, first things that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: grabbed my interest were, um, the Northern
lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, that's kind of disappeared.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was quality, you know, top of the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, when I was a kid and also the,
um, M 10, that's the second thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he got that from a friend of his in
Santa Cruz, Jr. And that's some fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: quality shit too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also known as Afghani number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, those strains are pretty
much not around anymore, not in quality
[SPEAKER_02]: form.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was very excited to see that both
those lines were exactly like I
[SPEAKER_02]: remembered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it was very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And coastal seeds is, you know,
KQ is trying to grow the old landrace pure
[SPEAKER_02]: ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause those are the things he remembers
when he was a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are what he wants to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm trying to bring back the
Indicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Bollywood BAM is, um, he's really in a
flavorful food and exotic flavors and
[SPEAKER_02]: tastes and his favorite weeds to Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, you know, he's going to breed for
what he likes.
[SPEAKER_02]: KQ is going to breed for what he likes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Hannibal's going to select for what
she likes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I want to read Indicas,
you know, and that's kind of what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, after I finished those two classic
Amsterdam strains, I'm going to,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, work with all the landrace Indicas he
has.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, working with, uh, Panama red
that, uh, he had, and that they keep her
[SPEAKER_02]: fino out of, uh, the selection after we
had had it for a year and I grew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, other people were raving how good it
was and KQ sent it to the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to our surprise, it was a two to one
CBD dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right around that same time,
he was doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had just done an open pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he does open pollination,
he marks all the females and he keeps them
[SPEAKER_02]: separated and he uses as many males as he
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, last summer in August,
my dog got cancer and, um, I, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to treat her with everything I
could and CBD, it was one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was inspired by that and I went to
him at KQ and I said, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: give me the, give me a hundred seeds out
of the, uh, CBD dominant fino and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to work it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took them and I grow them and every
one that wasn't CBD dominant, I killed
[SPEAKER_02]: except for one that was THCV.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it had a ridiculous amount and the
ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we never send the finished product to
the lab yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We might still do that, but the leaf,
uh, sample, the people at steep hill told
[SPEAKER_02]: Bollywood Bam that this is special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also told Bollywood Bam when he
took the leaf samples in cause he deals
[SPEAKER_02]: with labs and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that three or four of the,
uh, CBD females and one of the males had
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really high ratios of CBG and
those are in the open pollination too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, one of them was definitely a male
and really excited to be able to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: that pure land-raised CBD, um,
to the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: And KQ actually just sent, um,
some to file those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're pretty sure it's just
going to start its own galaxy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll be no debate, you know,
it's its own land-raised CBD, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, going to be excited to release
that to the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, this fall after it's tested,
you know, I did open pollination with like
[SPEAKER_02]: eight boys and, um, 12 to 16 females.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, about 60 out of the hundred were
CBD dominant and, and any ones that were
[SPEAKER_02]: weak, I called off and I just open
pollinated the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you first did the CBD,
sorry, when KQ first did the CBD open
[SPEAKER_01]: pollination, do you remember what type of
percentage of CBD traits there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people often reference,
uh, the, the older land-raised strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was like potentially a reasonably
high proportion of them that had CBD in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and it was kind of selectively bred
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find that that was the case or do
you think that that selective breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: took a much longer process than just kind
of recent years, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, that was probably the case
because, you know, back in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just said, Hey, this didn't get me as
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's kill this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, um, they selected that as their keeper
cup before I was in coastal seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I was able to just grow it
when I joined and, um, I found out how
[SPEAKER_02]: special it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told KQ, this is as good as anything I
got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought some to the Emerald cup,
um, two years ago and spoke to that people
[SPEAKER_02]: with the coastal booth and everyone raved
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, at that time we didn't know a CBD
dominant and most of them aren't CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant in that, in that, in that line,
but that, you know, that one mother that
[SPEAKER_02]: was CBD dominant are 60, 60% of her
offspring were.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're seeing now that I took just CBD
dominant males and fed them to just CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant females on the next open
pollination of locking down the CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we're seeing higher ratios and it's
exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a, it's a very good line
because what I've seen in the land race so
[SPEAKER_02]: far is, you know, some good, bad and ugly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stuff is good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I like that we found out just because
we kept that clone around to smoke and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, it's going to be cool to share with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it was Bodhi who said that he
found it was kind of like being a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit high and a bit on tequila having the
CBD Panama.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe the effects to
people?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the, the extrapolation of that
is when you do get it sequenced and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, it's its own land ratio,
you got the proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll open the doorway to a new type of
high kind of like what Bodhi referenced in
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, you don't get bud these
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you feel like, you know,
he called it, I think tequila weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's not really common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that it could open the door
to a whole new type of high in that
[SPEAKER_01]: regard?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: These old land race strains are definitely
unique on high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I need to get some pictures up on my
Instagram account, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not the prettiest stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for the sativa lovers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's long flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long skinny buds, um, very terpene rich.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are similar to haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are cherry and, um, lemon,
but, um, KQ1 says it is the best strain to
[SPEAKER_02]: give him the munchies right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I grow a lot of weed and I give him
whatever he needs for, um, cause he just
[SPEAKER_02]: got over cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: When he was younger, he just loves
sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he loves sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when he got sick, uh,
he really got to appreciate these strong
[SPEAKER_02]: and because I have, cause he said they
just helped his pain, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the black diamond, the chem dog D OG
cushions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it was cool to be able to
introduce some to the strands at that time
[SPEAKER_02]: in his life when he needed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you think that the use of CBD
treatment in conjunction with say
[SPEAKER_01]: chemotherapy, for example, is more
effective than CBD on its own?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, what I did with the dog was
chemotherapy treatment, um, combined with,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, we did four to one CBD dominant,
um, 40 pound dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was getting, um, about a hundred
milligrams and at first it was 75% CBD and
[SPEAKER_02]: then 25% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, we kept it like that for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, at that same period, I was taking
just pure CBD oil and rubbing it all over
[SPEAKER_02]: her belly and armpits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, so, um, she's still on the 25%
CBD, 75% THC right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she had a hell of a tolerance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, she, uh, um, got cleared up
for a cancer and, um, in January and we've
[SPEAKER_02]: kept her on, you know, just for safety
facts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause, uh, you can't even notice she's
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, she's got a very strong tolerance,
you know, I know grown men that can't
[SPEAKER_02]: handle, you know, 75 milligrams of THC,
you know, and she gets 25 of a CBD and I
[SPEAKER_02]: give it to her and, um, just to keep the
cancer away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause she had lymphoma and they said it
was, uh, you know, very close to stage
[SPEAKER_02]: four and they were pretty shocked by the
end of her chemotherapy first round and
[SPEAKER_02]: she had came in the heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, they said that that was extremely
rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, that's a good outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we're on the topic of dogs on your
Instagram, you got a photo and it says
[SPEAKER_01]: headband underdog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought they were two different strains
or are they the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, um, weasel and Fondo and the
crew out there, they had a strain that had
[SPEAKER_02]: all those same names.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not that same strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very good OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kushka.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, with the headbands, there is a
lot of confusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my friend, not so dog has that
headband from a mutual friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, all quality of a Klon and gave it to
them years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've all known each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't quality for quantity forever,
but I've known on since dogs since,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, like 2006 and, and well, it's,
and he's got three headbands now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one's lupus one is the one from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, one is Mandelbrots and you know,
DNA released a 707 and, um, Swerve
[SPEAKER_02]: released, released a headband and,
you know, so there's so many headbands and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just so confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, the one I have is I feel like the
best OG Kushka there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the history of OGs, we commonly hear
that the TK is the original, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still not confirmed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's still a lot of people
who dispute that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think the origins are?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think it's very interesting that,
uh, Josh D's cut the one also known as,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that is the guy that shared it on
Overgrow with a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_02]: the ghost OG, uh, the Josh D, the one that
he took down to Southern California that
[SPEAKER_02]: got was called Kush in Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got the OG, uh, named OG Kush in
Southern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that's the oldest one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think it's very, uh, you know,
there's something behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that and the TK both came from
Florida and they're both, uh, amazing cuts
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, some of the best I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you of the opinion that,
um, it's most likely heavily Afghani land
[SPEAKER_01]: race in origin or maybe a cross and
hybridized a bit further before the public
[SPEAKER_01]: got their hands on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it's Afghani dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Nunks are definitely very,
very round and dense that the high is very
[SPEAKER_02]: strong and, you know, kind of indica,
but, um, you know, it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, uh, time will tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it eventually will come to light
exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think it probably went back to
Northern lights because before OG Kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: the best strains were Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I read online that you could
harvest TK at 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I asked Duke about that and I was
like, what's the go with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was like 10 weeks and he
goes, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some strains have got like two
windows, so to speak, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it like peaks at 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good time to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then 11 weeks, you know, not so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then 12 weeks, you know, it gets good
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was thinking, I'd never really heard
of that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't doubt it, but do you
have any, um, kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: personal experience with things like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or have you heard of an idea like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, those are OGs and chem dogs are some
of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite strains to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I feel like the longer you can
keep them healthy and they're green and
[SPEAKER_02]: still growing and you know, not starting
to die off and catabolize themselves,
[SPEAKER_02]: the better they're going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like to take them definitely
70 days, you know, if not, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: 77.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I liked the long window.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always liked the stronger,
more narcotic high of all those strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, the longer you let them go,
the more, uh, better the buzz in my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the Northern lights are the same
way that you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to go like 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of those old clones, like I have
like black Domina and the dumpster,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, they need to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is the dumpster?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've read a little bit about it online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it on your Instagram,
but there's not a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've heard two backstories and
they're kind of similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, came from the university of Ohio
campus.
[SPEAKER_02]: One story was a guy went into a bar and he
was having a celebration drink and he's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he's like, I'm going to buy a
round.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just almost got busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cops were onto me and I took
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I threw it in the dumpster.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, I'm buying everyone around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't catch me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the guys in the bar were like,
Oh, what dumpster?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've also heard another story
where someone actually did get busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, the cops, it was early in the
back in the day and they just maybe threw
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the weed in the dumpster and
someone pulled a clone out who saw all the
[SPEAKER_02]: lights and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's rumored to be a old, uh,
G 13 NL or a G 13 Shiva, um, skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I see a lot of Northern lights in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think it's Northern lights,
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's your, you know, kind of
hypothesis on the history of the real G
[SPEAKER_01]: 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we, I'm kind of sick of hearing
that story about the university thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just don't think it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, KQ, um, told me about,
you know, he grew up in Santa Cruz and
[SPEAKER_02]: lived there his whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: He told me about this girl and he just sat
up North and he said her name was hash
[SPEAKER_02]: cake Patty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, back in the day, they used to,
the smugglers, the brotherhood and
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone else would smuggle hash and
surfboards and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, they were smashed and that's why
she was called a hash cake Patty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, he said that she had heard about
the government growing G 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she just turned some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: She found out of some Afghani hash and
called it, um, G 13 for marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't, I'm not saying that's
true, but it, you know, it really makes a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, he's very old school
and everything you see from the
[SPEAKER_02]: government, um, is a very sativa plant and
G 13 that Neville bred with was a very
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani plant, you know, similar to what,
um, the story Keg you said about hash cake
[SPEAKER_02]: Patty finding the seeds and the,
and the brotherhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: The brotherhood hash that they brought
back in the surfboards that was smashed
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while we're on the topic of the
brotherhood, it's kind of something I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't mentioned a whole lot,
but as time goes by, it feels like they're
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming more and more important in the
whole history of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you kind of tell us about the
brotherhood and what you knew about their
[SPEAKER_01]: contributions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're the original smugglers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I, you know, heard rumors
that some of the guys that, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: did the endless summer were part of the,
you know, and, you know, that's when they
[SPEAKER_02]: learned to smuggle stuff back in
surfboards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, you know, later grew so big
that they were buying brand new Mercedes
[SPEAKER_02]: Benz and VW is out of Germany and shipping
them over to Afghanistan and having them
[SPEAKER_02]: filled with hash and, and, and weed and,
um, taking that, uh, to California and
[SPEAKER_02]: then driving those cars already loaded
with stuff to the college universities and
[SPEAKER_02]: supplying the weed that wasn't available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, they're the first guys that
brought Indica's into America is what I
[SPEAKER_02]: heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, before that they were bringing
Mexican sativas and they are also brought
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the Mexican sativas to the
Hawaiian islands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, they were just, you know,
the original guys and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone that can get any genetics,
you know, that anyone saved off of any of
[SPEAKER_02]: their imports.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's what keggy was
looking for most.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause when he thinks back, you know,
who was the, who brought the best weed as,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when he smoked stuff,
that's who had the best, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they brought the tie in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they're just OGs, you know,
they paid the weatherman to break Timothy
[SPEAKER_02]: Leary out of jail, you know, when Timothy
Leary was in there for pot charges and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, they had, uh, Jimi Hendrix play,
uh, private concerts for them and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, their property in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you think it's safe to say that
what a lot of people consider to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: original breeders like Neville and the
likes most likely got their stock from
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or people, um, that, you know,
got the genetics from them and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, did the same thing I did,
you know, just earlier in time,
[SPEAKER_02]: kept the seeds alive and bred them so they
could have more of that the next year and
[SPEAKER_02]: not thinking of anything other than being
able to have good weed the next year,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so something you may or may not be
able to comment on is the more I research
[SPEAKER_01]: to the original skunk story, the more this
question becomes more, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of pertinent in my mind is in the
original story that guests talked about,
[SPEAKER_01]: they speak of how, um, the original skunk,
it was actually a project which was trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to recreate a clone that was both unstable
and didn't breed true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was how they ended up like trying
to recreate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was Mexican cross Colombian,
but then they couldn't, they couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: recreate it even just using raw land races
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they hybridized it using the,
um, Afghani first and then crossed it back
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and made what we knew as skunk number
one now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm interested in is what was
really that clone that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the, the, you know, progenator
skunk, um, what did it, like, was that
[SPEAKER_01]: boll stock potentially?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do you have any idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I really don't have any idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that would be an interesting question
to ask KQ, but, um, I think most of the
[SPEAKER_02]: stock was brotherhood back then,
cause they were the ones importing most of
[SPEAKER_02]: the weed and hash into America.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chances are, you know, it was genetics
that came from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the guys, um, from sacred seeds,
uh, were out of Santa Cruz and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, Sam, you know, I guess
ratted everybody out and fled to Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_02]: with all those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so are you of the opinion that,
uh, Sam skunk man is not a good dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know him personally, but you know,
it's not a good thing to narc on your
[SPEAKER_02]: friends and then take your, everybody's
work and go profit off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not fucking cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, there's a lot of,
there's a lot of, a lot of stories around,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like what I've basically heard
is that everything people give him credit
[SPEAKER_01]: for bringing to the market, he didn't
actually crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just took it from someone else,
you know, like notably, uh, skunk and
[SPEAKER_01]: haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've heard the online stuff and
I've also heard what KQ told me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I know nothing about his
breeding, but you know, I just turning on
[SPEAKER_02]: your friends like that and fleeing with
the genetics, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cold blooded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, all I know about that
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a breeder who is very near and dear
to my heart, Tom Hill, he releases a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of strains, which in many regards could
have kind of fallen into projects by
[SPEAKER_01]: coastal seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he was very much doing the open
pollination land race type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you view his strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any personal experience with
them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have high regard for all of his
strains and he was, uh, also a pioneer
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, thermal triangle on growing giant
trees, you know, like really monsterous
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, you know, and, um, his knowledge
is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's somebody that I would love
to meet.
[SPEAKER_02]: His packy lines are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I hold a deep chunk in high regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hold it in high regard and, um,
you know, he put out some amazing work,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I love it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so have you ever heard of,
um, any of the other lines that are not
[SPEAKER_01]: commonly referenced because he only ended
up having, like, I think it was like five
[SPEAKER_01]: or six lines for sale, but like you often
heard about other lines he worked on,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just like they weren't released.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one that most notably comes to mind
is he did, um, deep chunk cross X 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think he called that the Boneyard or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was these other strains that he
had made or was working on that had
[SPEAKER_01]: started to gain notoriety and like,
I think there was another line he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the blue Afghani.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like, have you ever heard
or worked with any of those or not really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I do not have the X 18 and,
um, I would love to get some seed stock of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I only have the deep chunk line and,
um, I'd also like to get that the pine
[SPEAKER_02]: tar, you know, Tom Hills Hayes is also
another line, you know, I'd love to get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just to help, you know,
keeping my personal seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so have you ever had what you would
consider to be a true or accurate
[SPEAKER_01]: representation of Hayes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's one of those ones where,
you know, like you still get packs that
[SPEAKER_01]: say Hayes, but everyone who had the real
stuff says like, you can't really find it
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just not the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the first time I, I tried pure
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in Trinity County at the tribal
stump in 1997.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that OG guy, B Smith from Denny Canyon
gave a talk that year and fucking right in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of all those people.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said he had like thousands of plants
that were like, he's a tall guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He reached over his head like eight feet
tall, just right in front of the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: crowd, police and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a real pioneer, but that same weekend
I got to smoke Hayes for the first time
[SPEAKER_02]: and wow, it was fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've seen it a few times since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it's definitely still there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know people that have original Hayes
cuts, um, but you know, I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone that has a seed stock of,
you know, really good old, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: pure Santa Cruz Hayes, you know,
only Amsterdam Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you make that distinction,
do you mean that the Amsterdam Hayes was
[SPEAKER_01]: worked towards that kind of less
flavorful, more kind of chilled out like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what I commonly hear from
people, or is there a difference,
[SPEAKER_01]: a different difference in your mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, unfortunately I never got
to smoke the Santa Cruz Hayes cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually knew one of the girls that
trimmed for the Hayes brothers and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, he contacted her and, you know,
hoping she'd have some seed stock,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and unfortunately she didn't,
you know, it's, you know, local Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard one of the brothers is still
alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not in the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's in the other substance substances
and, um, he's into them heavily,
[SPEAKER_02]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess the other brother died.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we may never know unless Sam
decides to tell the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Pacific Northwest hash plant is one
that interests me because I have a feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: it's possibly one of those same plants
which came from the brothers, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: blocks of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's a possibility?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you think that cut has
persisted for so long?
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it's not widely circulated,
but it also seems to pop up here and there
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy, I really wish I knew who held it so I
could give them credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'd seen that Bodie was breeding it
with it and, um, Kegyu and Bodie are good
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I told Kegyu, here,
here's the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything he fucking wants, you know,
I want that because when I was a kid,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I told you, I couldn't even
really afford packs of sensi seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to actually be able to get one of the
cuts that, you know, Neville was breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: with it, you know, it's fucking dream come
true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, I got it and it's,
it's, it's the funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me of the, the scully,
uh, the super scully, the, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the pot cash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it reminds me of the HP 13.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what I've heard is pure Afghani,
uh, Ileane race.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's an amazing cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how similar is it to the scully?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like in the sense that is the
hash, the, you know, the, the PNW hash
[SPEAKER_01]: plant the same?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just kind of look pretty
unsuspecting and just kind of knock you
[SPEAKER_01]: down as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they all have the same look.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, um, you know, none of them are very
resinous, but it's the turps and just that
[SPEAKER_02]: real good Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, um, I grew the HP 13 back in,
in, in well, it's with my friend,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, quality over quantity and,
uh, 2006 and ended up dropping that in
[SPEAKER_02]: like 2008.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I just couldn't get the powdery
mildew off of it, but that was an amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: strain and actually the most, uh,
strain that I'm looking for the most right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want that one the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they all have very similar,
uh, buds and, uh, when you break them
[SPEAKER_02]: open, that's when the nose really comes
out of them, you know, and when you break
[SPEAKER_02]: them open and start tearing it up,
it's just a very intoxicating nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, when Neville got the cut,
um, he took his best Indica male,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was his Northern lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he bred it to the Pacific North hash
plant and released those and all hash
[SPEAKER_02]: print, um, F1 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you did a back cross and that is
the hash plant seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, it's really cool to be
able to put the Northern lights,
[SPEAKER_02]: number one male, um, up to these clones,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, with that in mind,
I guess theoretically, cause we should
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe state this for anyone who's not on
board with this idea is that we,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I strongly believe that Skelly is the
result of a plant from Neville's original,
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed bank, the hash plant seed stock,
which is what we just said was the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: plant cross to the NL one back across to
the hash plant again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that in mind, you could
theoretically back cross Skelly either
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, no, you couldn't cause you don't
have a male of the hash plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you've got a male of the Northern
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could back cross it that direction
and you could also now you have to reverse
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, um, I know actually a
backyard farmer in South Fork seeds got an
[SPEAKER_02]: old hash plant pack and it was really old
stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, please give me a
male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make a triple back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cross off the specific Northwest and they
didn't get a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, unfortunately, um, KQ has a friend in
Washington that in 1989, um, did F twos
[SPEAKER_02]: off Pacific Northwest hash plant seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a few years later he did,
uh, another, um, breeding took him to F
[SPEAKER_02]: three and, um, he's given KQ some of those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, extremely excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, uh, possibly work with those
males.
[SPEAKER_02]: If his friend would give us permission,
you know, if not, I'm going to do it just
[SPEAKER_02]: per, uh, preservation sake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wonder if you would ever be able
to find out who popped the initial,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the, the land raise hash plant
seeds that, you know, Neville ended up
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the clone of for his initial
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder who popped that found that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I was hoping you would ask Bodie that
I'm going to have to have a conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: with Bodie.
[SPEAKER_02]: About that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'll know, um, the backstory on who's
been keeping the clone alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know, um, archive and CSI also had
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed it on all three of those
breeders list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, I knew, uh, KQ and buddy
were good friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's who I went through to access it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't ask Bodie.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to know the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get that question answered soon
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I wanted to jump back to for just
a moment was, um, you mentioned in a story
[SPEAKER_01]: a few minutes ago that you lost a plant
because you couldn't get rid of the PM off
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a hypothetical for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you had only one cutting of a
strain that you really love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got that same issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you rather lose a cut than
potentially have to use some kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, systemic chemical type thing,
or would you, um, just lose it and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: be happy with the memories?
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that point, um, around 2005,
I was one of the first people I knew that
[SPEAKER_02]: could get rid of a powdery mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hit California pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, before that known, I'd really
dealt with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have to grow in a well, it's
Hannibal and I moved up to Trinidad and
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt County and we lived right on the
coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I took, Master Kush, train wreck,
Sourway, Purple Way, Sour Diesel,
[SPEAKER_02]: Headband, Pacific Northwest, dog shit,
and the HP 13 clone up into that house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was getting rid of the, um,
powdery mildew by getting the plants in a
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy grow environment, healthy
humidity, good amount of light,
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy organic nutrients, growing the
plants fast, spraying them with potassium
[SPEAKER_02]: silicate and neem oil at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my only method of attack back
then was those two products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I had everything else clean for
several runs of clones, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, those two would just pop it out,
uh, the Pacific Northwest and the hash
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just killed them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I personally never used pesticides
strictly against it.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent organic nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not scared of anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like brain it on, um, because with my
organic IPM regiments, I spray every other
[SPEAKER_02]: day with a, uh, a Graco, um, X nine paint
sprayer really hard when I'm cleaning up
[SPEAKER_02]: clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I'll spray every other day with
micronized sulfur for a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll switch to potassium
silicate, neem oil and essential oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll spray every other day for a month
of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll put them through like a week
of green clean, um, there's another
[SPEAKER_02]: product I'll use to just kill the fuck out
of bugs and systemic of powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like if you get enough of those
products in the plant and they're in a
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy grow environment, growing fast,
that you can get rid of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here's the million dollar question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have to abandon crop if you get
some kind of bug infestation, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe root aphids, maybe mites if you're
in flower, because that seems to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: the big one I have issues discussing with
people, like people say to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like I'm kind of converting into
organics and they're like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do I do if I get an issue in flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of like, um, you just kind
of avoid that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, so there's really
nothing you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, yeah, you can't
really spray the IPM stuff in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your, what do you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you just prevention is the best
answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I've been growing since the
early nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just told you how serious my
IPM methods are to clean up clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, what I do before I decide to
flower something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put them through literally two and a
half months of every other day spraying,
[SPEAKER_02]: literally a micronized sulfur will kill,
uh, micro mites, spider mites,
[SPEAKER_02]: any fungal disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so all essential oils,
neem oil and potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like you get in all those
products in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you're not going to have problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course I've had runs that got fucked up
by spider mites or powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I grow number one reason is for my
personal head stash and I want really
[SPEAKER_02]: good, strong, clean meds and I'm
dedicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the reason I've developed that
two and a half month of cleaning up clones
[SPEAKER_02]: before I bring them into my flower room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that also gets them really healthy so
that I'm going to see their true genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: potential and, um, you know, not
contaminate the rest of the collection,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then I'll put the whole
collection through that treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once a year, just in case, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the issue of PM, I've heard that
some people say once a clone's got it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got it forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and the idea of it being
systemic kind of hints to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I've never found
hard evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you believe that you can get rid of it
or you're just kind of beating it down to
[SPEAKER_01]: the point where it's not likely to
manifest out?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that you can outrun it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I mentioned, uh, Hannibal and I moved
to Trinidad and those, uh, that Pacific
[SPEAKER_02]: Northwest dog shit and, um, HP 13 kept
persisting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, when we called those, um, I didn't
spray shit and we had no PM for eight
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe it was through getting the
plants in a healthy environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing them fast and then taking cuttings
off the top of the plant while you were
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting the plant at the same time with
potassium, silicon, and nemoils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, both of those are fungicides in
their own right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it might be in the stump,
but, you know, I took my stumps at that
[SPEAKER_02]: point, took the top of the cuttings and I
fucking got rid of the stumps,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and just kept the tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe, um, a hundred percent that
you can get rid of powder, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery mildew that way, especially if you
use a micronized sulfur, which I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know about back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's even a tougher plan on the PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nothing I'd want to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, for something I'd want to smoke,
but we're talking about cleaning up old
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics here so that they're not lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you also of the opinion that
sulfur is one of the more overlooked
[SPEAKER_01]: elements in when people are kind of
building their soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps to bring out turps, um,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, if we look at the discussion of
jetting, genetics, sorry, if we look at
[SPEAKER_01]: the discussion of genetics throughout
history, people often say, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics used to be really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that what they're actually
trying to maybe say is that there used to
[SPEAKER_01]: be more variety or do you think genetics
in the past were better, like on average?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think on average the genetics are much
better today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think our genetic diversity has
somewhat been lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, especially with the sativas that are
very difficult to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow them for twice the amount of time
and you get these small spindly buds that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's not really what the market
wants now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people that's their cup of tea,
those, uh, soaring psychedelic highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not many commercial growers
that'll provide that form, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's not very many places that,
uh, people can go and buy those types of
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, you know, unless it's, you know,
haze or train wreck cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you tackle that issue of having,
you know, really long flowering strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say, you know, an extreme
example, you're flowering a 16 week
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, sorry, no, let's just say 14,
you know, no, I'm really flowering 16 week
[SPEAKER_01]: strains, 14 week strain, you know,
not that unheard of, but, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: should you be charging like, you know,
close to twice as much as like a seven or
[SPEAKER_01]: eight week strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how, how do you compensate that in
the business model when I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot of people are probably not
going to expect, maybe they'll accept a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of a price increase, but maybe if you
look at the flower time proportion,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately, they, they won't budge and
that, and that was the driving force that
[SPEAKER_01]: got us to this spot, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, how do you think we'd
tackle that issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, unfortunately, um, what I see is
people that are complaining that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: no sativas, but then when the sativas are
available, they're not willing to pay any
[SPEAKER_02]: more for them and the sativas actually get
overlooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much it's, uh, if you're a sativa
lover, I recommend you get some good
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa genetics and grow them yourself in
a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause you know, that's where sativas
really shine in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we look at the photos on your
Instagram, a lot of them are from
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, you probably struggled to kind of
find one in an indoor setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do indoors at all or are you all
outdoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I love indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep a lot of my mom's indoors
currently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am excited actually to be moving them to
my own facility with just me and Hannibal
[SPEAKER_02]: and Salinas going for the legal permit
down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, 10,000 square feet so that we can keep
the quality up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, you know, I love to work outside,
you know, and if I had an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_02]: work in a greenhouse versus an indoor
warehouse, I'm going to take the
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse any day of the week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I love being outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love being with nature, fresh air,
not under the artificial lights being
[SPEAKER_02]: under the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I'm really, really working hard
to bring the quality of my greenhouse up
[SPEAKER_02]: to the quality of my indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's a fun challenge for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's an interesting one in my
opinion, because often I find people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they'll say, outdoor is the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unbeatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I think what they're really
trying to say is like, theoretically it
[SPEAKER_01]: can do better than indoor, but rarely do I
find personally outdoor that is better
[SPEAKER_01]: than indoor, at least my indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like are you of the same opinion
that like outdoor is the best or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in the sense of that mindset of
like theoretically, or do you literally
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that or do you believe the
opposite?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I just like to be honest with myself
and, um, you know, my favourite strains
[SPEAKER_02]: are Indica's and when I turn them out
inside, they're fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm getting close to that quality I
feel like in the greenhouse now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I feel like greenhouse quality is
definitely better than full sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really love smoking full sun organic
wheat though, that being said,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if there's something about,
um, especially if it's grown in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground, you know, and it can get some of
the native soil and the flavours,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, in the full season and just the whole
experience is, uh, is, is really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if you're talking about
growing an old clone, like one of my black
[SPEAKER_02]: dominance or one of my chem dogs or one of
those old OGs, indoor in a stable,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, humidity and a stable temperature,
um, those old client clones shine better
[SPEAKER_02]: with, they just like the stable
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it has to do with the
lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's more about the stable
humidity, stable temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, often you'll find that
plants will grow slightly different
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypically, slightly different taste
wise and potency wise when you compare
[SPEAKER_01]: them indoors to outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find that there are some strains
that, you know, have one taste indoors and
[SPEAKER_01]: when it's outdoors, it's like,
it's quite a pronounced difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: flavour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what strain to you has the biggest
just natural variation?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you transition it from indoors to say
greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, um, the chem dog D is,
uh, uh, one of the flavours that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: really hit or miss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I really enjoyed the full season
sun grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really, uh, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get a lot of strains out in the sun
and they're just going to have thicker
[SPEAKER_02]: stems and really shine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the best stuff outside,
if you can get it in a greenhouse is the
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, they just shine outside
under the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't like being close to the lamps.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grow all tall, you know, and then
getting close to that warm lamp.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't seem to like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you can get them in a greenhouse
and just get them under the natural sun,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just, that's the one of the strains
that does turn out better outside than
[SPEAKER_02]: does inside for me are the sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's your favourite land-raised
sativa?
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest with you, I really like this
Panama red stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been smoking the crap out of the THC
Vina, uh, THC V, uh, Fina.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we haven't got the percentage tested,
but I've been smoking that a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, to be honest with you,
I haven't worked with too many
[SPEAKER_02]: land-raised, um, sativa lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, KQ that's his specialty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, like I said, I'm new to coastal
seeds and I went for the old Afghani lines
[SPEAKER_02]: that I knew as a kid first.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, it's, uh, I have some
cool old cuts, you know, that I like a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my favourites is the, um,
monkey posits, uh, um, Vietnamese soldier
[SPEAKER_02]: brought back a Vietnamese black and he
crossed it with the Nepalese highland
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa up in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a real old clone that,
um, for like a 12 to 14 link sativa
[SPEAKER_02]: really, uh, has a lot of earthy,
um, Kush flavours in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, they're really kind of
grounding, not so paranoid of a high for
[SPEAKER_02]: that sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of my favourites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the Pacific Northwest dog shit,
um, is another one of my favourite old
[SPEAKER_02]: sativa cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a plant we've never really
spoke of on the show, but I think I read
[SPEAKER_01]: online that there's like a few fake earth
shit cuts that go around.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you, have you had anything along those
lines or do you think like, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just, um, one of those cuts where
there's a few, there's other plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: have similar characteristics, but like,
you know, it's fake essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a humble dog shit,
which is different from the Oregon Pacific
[SPEAKER_02]: Northwest dog shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, if you go to any of these clubs
or dispensaries in California,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to have clones of everything
on the menu and 99 out of a hundred times
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to be fake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty much, um, you want your dog
shit cut to come from a certain crew in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because that's where,
you know, it's the real one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I'm big on my clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's provenance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really try to get them through the right
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's the right clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in general, when you're looking to
do a breeding project, do you approach it
[SPEAKER_01]: in more of like a calculated method in
that you kind of thinking what is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: pair really specifically well with a
certain strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you more so just like, I like this
one male, let's hit everything with it and
[SPEAKER_01]: then see if any of them particularly work
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, I've, uh, I've kind of been doing
kind of like in cross work where,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, crossing these lines back into
something that I think sent them,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um, or definitely confirmed in
the strain, you know, to kind of stabilize
[SPEAKER_02]: it and bring it back to a pure form so
that other breeders and friends can get
[SPEAKER_02]: these strains and back crossing further or
take them and work lines with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really want to provide old school
genetics and stuff that's worthy for
[SPEAKER_02]: people to breed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you foresee a time where your breeding
methods would have to change by virtue of
[SPEAKER_01]: just, you know, there's, let's just say we
fast forward 10 years from now and Coastal
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds has got an awesome menu with most
land race strains on it worked to a point
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're happy to have it publicly
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think you would then look at say,
doing some F1 hybrids with land race
[SPEAKER_01]: strains kind of similar to how Bodhi does,
or what would, what would you look to do
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: If, you know, you had to kind of,
if you're forced to evolve out of just
[SPEAKER_01]: doing preservation work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, I'm going to spend 50% of my
time pretty much doing the preservation,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, pure lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm going to spend the other 50%
concentrating on these NL lines with the
[SPEAKER_02]: hash plant and the M10.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, working those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you have an end goal foreseeable
with those, or you just kind of see where
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes you?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to remake that, uh, old kill strain
from North Carolina that I used to got.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best weed I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, um, the Rapture, the kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sorry, you said that was a G13 cross
NL hash plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: NL hash plant, NL G13.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Old school Amsterdam stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are you going to fill that NL G13
spot?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, luckily I just got that airborne G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you think it all, it was maybe the
airborne used originally, or you like,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I guess what I'm thinking is the
airborne G13 in my eyes is not like pure
[SPEAKER_01]: G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, it's a cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the closest I can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it's actually, uh, I think it's a
G13 by NL too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's actually half the work done for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you think the real original G13
is still out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you just think like, no, we haven't
heard about it for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's most likely gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I like to think that,
um, anything could be out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people that put in
work, uh, don't come online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just came online with my Instagram
account a few years ago, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I had tons of strains that,
uh, people really didn't have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I've really shared them a
lot, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you never know who's going to come out
and burn a blast from the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of time when these classics come
up, they want, uh, cookies or skittles or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that for these old classic
gems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy to belage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the most terpene rich plant
you've ever had or grown yourself as a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of a just totally different question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, uh, a lot of time when you
get super high amount of terpenes in a
[SPEAKER_02]: strain, you don't really get potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a rare combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, this lemon tree out of Santa
Cruz, that's one of the few, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: strains that really combines the two
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an amazing cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you, do you know the history behind the
lemon tree?
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to have gotten, uh, popularity
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I think people may have seen
it, uh, swamp boys breed with an S one of
[SPEAKER_01]: it as a mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's even a bit of an interesting
thing in itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have the cut through Santa Cruz and
it is, um, literally, uh, as soon as I
[SPEAKER_02]: harvested it, it's like this top 10 top,
maybe top five, um, in the collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard it's, you know, uh,
maybe an old strain called lemon drop or,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, uh, a lemon Thai cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's a very short, compact Indica
growing plant with a very lemon strong
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor and a narcotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you think this isn't a new hybrid,
but just something that's been unknown for
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, do you kind of know any more of
the genetics besides the potentially that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the lemon drop?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's, uh, all I know,
you know, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rest would just be me taking somebody
that's something else, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: might not be true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to lead anyone in the
wrong direction, but I'm pretty sure
[SPEAKER_02]: that's kind of like what the guys are
saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, on the other spectrum of
instead of being a hyper cut, like lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: tree, what do you think is the most
underrated cut?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the one that doesn't get enough
cred for, for what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I think Kim dog,
do you send down the best weed and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I don't have that many people
that agree with me unless I smoke it with
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the black dominance are really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the super scully, the puck hash plant
when done proper is, uh, really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Red Lebanese hash plant I have is an
amazing cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the 88 cheat 13 hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all some of the most kind of
underrated, I guess, 88 cheat 13 hash
[SPEAKER_02]: plants been getting a lot of respect
because Bode, he used it and, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just while we're on the topic,
I guess you kind of already answered it
[SPEAKER_01]: overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just said you prefer the chem D,
but do you think the 91 is more potent
[SPEAKER_01]: than the D or no, the D actually takes the
potency for you as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Potency a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when done right, I think, uh,
they're both very picky, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I think they're equally picky.
[SPEAKER_02]: People say the 91 is pickier, but I think,
uh, the D is very picky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Picky too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it's mine and Hannibal's favorite
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's the one cut you most wish
you could get your hands on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, HP 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you confident it is still around?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either through the, uh, island crew or the
New York crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I could probably get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, that's obviously a
lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I found an interesting photo on
your Instagram feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it, it's, I'm pretty sure it's
like a compost tea from what you said in
[SPEAKER_01]: the description, but honestly,
it looks like soil with these crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: mycelium hyphae forming all through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of looks like, you know, I kind of
like the way Bokashi does to your top
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your recipe for an awesome tea like
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that was like the most photogenic
looking tea I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so one of the, one of the key
ingredients for me to get that mycelium,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, that's thick, it'll literally,
uh, stop fungus and that's dead in their
[SPEAKER_02]: tracks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll, it'll kill them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, is the grow Kashi and then,
you know, you mix that with some giant fly
[SPEAKER_02]: earth medicine, um, brilliant black,
and then, uh, some really high quality
[SPEAKER_02]: compost and earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really, you know, it really,
I can't emphasize, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: how important it is to get high quality of
those two products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also to get several sources of high
quality compost, several sources of high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality, um, earthworm castings for the
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The keys are the, the grow Kashi and the
brilliant black, they just get it looking
[SPEAKER_02]: like a carpet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in general, how would you describe
your grow style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you like, you know, you kind of run
like a no till type of system or more of
[SPEAKER_01]: like a super soil type of thing or liquid?
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, uh, would describe my style as,
um, I do a lot of top dressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a lot of fresh extractions of
earthworm castings and compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't brew them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just extract them into the water and
water immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of, uh, foliar feeds as we go into
the first, uh, beginning of flower and
[SPEAKER_02]: through vetch, you know, to really make
sure it has everything it needs and the
[SPEAKER_02]: right parts of the plant and the top of
the plant at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, um, you know, I just kind
of, uh, you know, sounds a little hokey
[SPEAKER_02]: pokey, but I can, you know, just can look
at the plants and, you know, I get high
[SPEAKER_02]: and I spend time around them and I can
just read, read the plants and what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're lacking and how happy they are by
how they're holding their leaves and how
[SPEAKER_02]: their growth is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I really feel like if you can
hang out in your grow room for a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: period of time, um, look at your plants,
kind of vibe off of them, leave for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit, go take a bunch of bong hits
or, you know, smoke a joint, whatever you
[SPEAKER_02]: like to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then go back in and just read and
vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do that a couple of times a day for a
long period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're really going to be able to just
walk into a grow room and look at plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and be like, that's that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that strain is unhappy because of the
way it's holding its leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see, you know, the different strains
by, uh, you know, their leaves and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, just how happy they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you really, you know,
it just comes with spending time with the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what do you think is the kind of
upper ceiling of what one person can tend
[SPEAKER_01]: to in terms of plant numbers and giving
them adequate care?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think a lot of people are
worried about the idea of big companies
[SPEAKER_01]: coming along and, you know, like the idea
of like a grower having to tend to like
[SPEAKER_01]: 10,000 plants in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, it's like, surely you're
spreading yourself too thin at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like plants can't be getting enough
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what for you is, do you think the
upper limit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, you know, I grew nine acres
for a hemp company in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time we got it back around to
the other side of the field to water them,
[SPEAKER_02]: they were about to die of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that wasn't a fun
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since then I've turned down a couple
of job offers to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: head growers for large operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Hannibal and I decided to,
um, you know, go for it and put the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: life savings and, uh, to go get permitted
in Monterey County.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Salinas and, uh, get a 10,000 square
foot permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, that'll be cool because
I'll be able to have the collection in
[SPEAKER_02]: there safe and a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a question I wanted to ask you,
because I think you might be able to give
[SPEAKER_01]: an interesting perspective on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done some research on the history of
Northern Lights and I'm sure you're pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: well versed in it, given the projects
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a feeling that the guy who first
gave Neville the Northern Lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the Indian Joe, I have a feeling
that's Romulan Joe.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, for a long time growing up,
I'd heard that they were the same person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, recently when I started the project,
um, we did a lot of investigation,
[SPEAKER_02]: KQ calling up old friends, um,
me doing any research, Bollywood BAM
[SPEAKER_02]: doing, um, computer research and Bollywood
BAM found this high times article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where it said that they were the same
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: KQ's research, um, led to, uh,
the fact that they are definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: different people from what I believe in
what he told me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think some of the original,
uh, Northern Lights guys are on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not on Facebook myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, from what he told me, some guy named
Herbie is the guy that brought them back
[SPEAKER_02]: from Afghanistan and gave them to Seattle
Greg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seattle Greg or worked with two Joes and
one of them was Indian Joe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's who KQ's friend, uh,
Classic Seeds met up in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where he got the handheld
number one stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, uh, Seattle Greg is in the
islands and that would be one hell of an
[SPEAKER_02]: interview if you could get him to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you think as with people like
this, where that old stock resides,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just necessarily for Northern Lights,
but for everything type thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, if they still have some
Northern Lights, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we're not supposed to release the
Northern Lights pure ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're only supposed to release hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why do you think they wouldn't want to
come forward and get credit for what is
[SPEAKER_01]: easily, you know, the poster child of all
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think, um, from what I've heard,
maybe he hasn't been approached by
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I think if he's admitted it on
Facebook, why wouldn't he want to admit it
[SPEAKER_02]: on a bigger show and get further into it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to follow that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been digging around on Instagram
for a bit and I found a post which says
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have a legendary backstory behind
the red Lebanese hash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you think it could be closely
related to the G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what is that story?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, from my understanding,
Howard Marks, the smuggler gave Neville's
[SPEAKER_02]: two favorite strains, um, the red Lebanese
hash plant and the G13 from America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, Howard Marks was also known as
Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's since passed away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, he also, you know, he obviously
was importing a lot of weed from all over
[SPEAKER_02]: the world to England and to Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, he, uh, shared some of those,
uh, red Lebanese seeds with somebody in
[SPEAKER_02]: California and, um, by Lilywood BAM,
um, was given the cut to hold onto because
[SPEAKER_02]: they knew he held onto stuff and he gave
it to me a few years ago and I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: holding onto it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's from the same stock,
you know, I 100% believe that,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, from smell, taste, grow, um,
stone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's just, unfortunately we just have
the cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have seed stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what can people expect from the
Northern line crosses you've made?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what type of plants would like if,
what type of plants should someone expect
[SPEAKER_01]: if they buy this packet?
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, what would you
advise each person to get, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so if I'm looking for a real super
narcotic one, which one is the one I
[SPEAKER_01]: should go for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to be honest with you, if,
uh, they're not up to par, I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: releasing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, some of my favorites this far,
uh, are the black lights and, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: Pachia, the super scully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ash plant by the, uh, Northern lights,
number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since you see it's a selection of
black dominant by Northern lights,
[SPEAKER_02]: number one, just because of, uh,
I like to smoke them others a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you know, I just liked that old
school narcotic Indica bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just last question on Northern
lights for the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often I've read things online saying that
the, uh, SSC in a lot of their crosses,
[SPEAKER_01]: they used a strain called the basic five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard people say that they think that
it's just like what they called the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern lights five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think they were the same or
different?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that they were the same from my
understanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, the basic five was the, uh,
NL five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when people think of Afghanis in
general, they're often thinking of things
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, Baba Kush and Master Kush,
like, you know, these real squat plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: big fat leaves, you know, really broad
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, as we know, there's, there's a
lot of Afghanis that aren't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're more thin, they're more
taller.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think it got to the point where
people think of Afghanis as these,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, squat Indica plants and no one
really thinks of them as, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: these taller, thinner leaf plants,
even though they were, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, from what I heard, um, a lot of the,
you know, original hippies that went over
[SPEAKER_02]: there that make their own hash and they
preferred the little bushweeds that grew
[SPEAKER_02]: in the drainage ditches that were these
really fat-leaved Indicas that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just really slow growing,
hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what the people were actually growing
fields of was a taller growing variety,
[SPEAKER_02]: just easier to grow and, um, you know,
easy to grow an acre of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: cause growing an acre of Baba Kush is a
pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, uh, Bollywood Bam,
um, got, uh, a bunch of seeds from his
[SPEAKER_02]: father.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, unfortunately, right before his father
was killed by a suicide bomber in
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it's called the, he calls it the
last laugh out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, his, his father, um, and, uh,
you know, that's a much taller growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, longer inner node Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I guess, uh, his father had
connections and he got it from the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I guess the department of
agriculture over there in Afghanistan in
[SPEAKER_02]: the strain had 250 years of, uh,
provenance behind it documented.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what, uh, we were all thinking we
were, uh, you know, going to see Afghani,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um, it was a taller,
very drought resistant, very tough plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that had CBD in the gene pool,
THC in the gene pool, um, purple in the
[SPEAKER_02]: gene pool, green in the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they were a denser Indica Nog,
but they had a taller, uh, stretchier
[SPEAKER_02]: inner node structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, something that would be
better for a large scale agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, the only time he's released any
of that was for the auction for
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandelbrot's son.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's kind of keeps that line tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you guys ever consider working
with it or you just don't see it having
[SPEAKER_01]: that much breeding potentially?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's just so suited for just an
entirely different style of growing to
[SPEAKER_01]: what we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Bam has done a few, uh,
open pollinations on it and, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a question you'd have to ask him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how would you feel about ever doing
a cross where you're really kind of mixing
[SPEAKER_01]: old and new, you know, like one of your
old school lines, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe the Panama with something totally
new, you know, like just to throw a random
[SPEAKER_01]: one out there in pure Kush, you know,
one of the kind of more newer hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, um, you'll see some of
those for me, but mostly you'll see,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the older, you know, classics clones
that have stood the test of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bollywood Bam likes to breed with some of
the newer clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll see that from him, you know,
when he did the Puna butter cookies and
[SPEAKER_02]: the holy headband, those were two examples
of him breeding in that style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, mostly what you're going to see from
Kegyu is, uh, um, open pollination,
[SPEAKER_02]: land race, pure sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the cool thing when we come
together, um, Hannibal likes something,
[SPEAKER_02]: Bollywood Bam likes something,
I like something, and Kegyu likes
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we all, uh, share genetics and then,
uh, breed for our own, uh, what we like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so are you kind of the same school of
thought of, uh, what I think DJ Short is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of quoted as saying is that,
you know, at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that really matters is the end effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess the underlying question I'm
wondering is, um, what makes something
[SPEAKER_01]: worthwhile breeding for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it just come down to effect or does
it have to be a compromise of things?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it's 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, um, I want, you know,
to breed for, uh, strong Indicus,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I remember, and I want to have,
and those are the favorites in my
[SPEAKER_02]: collection and I have them fresher and re,
you know, rejuvenated not, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 15 to 30 year old cuts is, uh,
you know, a really exciting thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what is the biggest fear you have
about the sweeping out slash, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of unrolling of legalization in
California?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you think it's going to affect
things positively and negatively?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, unfortunately there's a lot of
people getting into it that see nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: but dollar signs and they're growing way
too much weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's the, why we went for the 10,000
square foot permit and it's actually the
[SPEAKER_02]: smallest permit available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, that way we can pay
attention to our weed and hand a bolt and
[SPEAKER_02]: I can grow it and it'll be grown by us and
not by irrigation or, uh, other people
[SPEAKER_02]: that we hire.
[SPEAKER_02]: To work, um, we can actually handle it
ourselves and with, you know, but,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I had to basically, you know,
spend every single penny we'd ever saved
[SPEAKER_02]: in our life just to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been extremely stressful and the
fact that, you know, it is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's going to be hard, you know,
uh, for certain people to be nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: like they were sharing gin eggs with
friends and, you know, the greed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just because everyone's putting
their whole life on the risk, that's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, the people getting into it
from other industries just for money,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, that's not a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, old school people being left out and
taking advantage of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the worst thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I advise anybody, uh,
team up with your friends and try to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: permit, you know, go wherever,
wherever you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get them now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, or you're going to be shut out in
California and let's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: keep the power.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the people that have been pioneering
and working with this planet, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: their whole lives, they deserve it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, one of the good things
that's going to come out of it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, you know, me getting them
other collection and a place where,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I can go over 99 plants and keep
them legally safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause in Santa Cruz, I'm only allowed 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, then, uh, being able to select
over 99 without fear, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and to be able to show stuff like that,
you know, to people on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times they don't get to see
everything just, uh, for safety sake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just to play devil's advocate,
let's say the worst case situation happens
[SPEAKER_01]: where there is just a few large companies
mass producing really bad quality wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think in that situation,
things would revert back to how they were
[SPEAKER_01]: before legalization where we go back to,
you know, people just doing stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: underground, growing, you know,
the better stuff and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the black market blooms again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I like to think that,
uh, you know, this show will hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: encourage people in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if they don't have their permits to go
out and get their permits, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see, um, the people that
have been in the game, stay in the game,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but like that, you know,
if, you know, I said, Hannibal and I are
[SPEAKER_02]: risking our whole, uh, life savings on it
and we're going to work our hardest to
[SPEAKER_02]: make it work, you know, and we work hard,
but you know, if it didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit, I'd be in another state,
um, in a house, someone else paying all
[SPEAKER_02]: the fucking bills, you know, I'm never
going to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what the fuck I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have any fear then I'm not going
to have fear, you know, but I'm putting
[SPEAKER_02]: everything I got into making it an illegal
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a question that's quite
specifically relevant to Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that people should compromise
for access to medicine if it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sub quality, you know,
is it worth allowing like a pseudo medical
[SPEAKER_01]: system through, if all it is, is,
um, you know, like large companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: you even like specifically people like
tobacco industries are really looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: getting in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was just a few big providers like
them, would you settle for that in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of like, as, as a society, should we
settle for that or should we be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, have to be able to grow our own or at
least have, you know, some means of access
[SPEAKER_01]: to high quality medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say overgrow the government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone in Australia should be growing
their own medicine, legal or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if it's not legal, just don't
tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, do it like we did in
Virginia in old school days and make the
[SPEAKER_02]: good medicine there for the people and
grow it good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, from, form your crews and you
know, form your, uh, networks to get the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the buds to the, the patients underground,
you know, definitely don't trust the man
[SPEAKER_02]: that grow your medicine, you know,
everybody should be able to grow their own
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're too sick to grow their own
medicine, they should know that someone's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to grow it for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not fucking spraying pesticides on
it or, you know, doesn't give two shits
[SPEAKER_02]: about it because I feel like it's a type
of plant that needs love and, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: it needs, you know, a caring, uh,
um, person to take care of it or the
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine isn't going to be the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely the same belief.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just to kind of get into our last
couple of questions, who's a breeder who
[SPEAKER_01]: you really like their work, you know,
and you know, bonus points if it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who's just doing land race work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Archive, CSI, Top Dog, Freeborn
Selections, Dos Paros, Bodhi Seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm leaving some out because,
um, you know, it's the, you actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's the golden age of
America, American breeders right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, with, uh, you know, the selections and
the, this, the, the community,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, being able to get so many
different clones off of, uh, Instagram and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, and so many different people are
breeding and going in different
[SPEAKER_02]: directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's going to be cool to see how shit
progresses because I know coastal seeds is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be trying to provide the land
race building blocks and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's people out there trying to
progress stuff and bring new flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's just so many different people
with different goals and so many people
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding in America that it's,
you know, it's, it's kind of the golden
[SPEAKER_02]: age.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you were just a breeder,
sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you were just a grower and you
had to go out right now and you had to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: one pack of seeds, a modern hybrid,
which pack would you buy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, chem dog from top dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of his pure chem dog crosses,
preferably one of the Tres dog back
[SPEAKER_02]: crosses, because I feel like the Tres dog,
uh, triple back cross Chem D he made,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, is one of the best breedings in the
marijuana community in history.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, he gave those Tres dog seeds
to high and lonesome, high and lonesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, bred the, uh, dog waltz and the
Appalachia with Bodie bred with,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then, um, JJ, uh, kept him and worked
him himself and made the star dog and the
[SPEAKER_02]: original New York city diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, there are so many keeper star dog
cuts and my dog waltz cut is one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: most amazing and all the amazing stuff
that's come from the Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd say, uh, you know, just going to
have to go with the odds, the history
[SPEAKER_02]: stack down and go for some inbred chem
from JJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had to go for one pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what are your kind of, you know,
top five, top 10 favorite strains for just
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chem dog, um, OG black Domino,
my hash plants, and then more chem dog D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice tight list.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I didn't love it, I wouldn't keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my headband is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love all these new strands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love dosy does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the real good cookie cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this on such sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just got that papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty impressive stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smoking on that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the strawberry banana from
Crockett, you know, that's some serious
[SPEAKER_02]: fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a lot of stuff from Bodie.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, hippie slayer, dread bread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I could never even remember
all the clones I have at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why, you know, labeling a list is
very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could have one strain back that
you used to have, but have lost,
[SPEAKER_01]: what one would it be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, there's so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one is tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I had sag Martha's bubble berry from
like, uh, 96 and that stuff was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every, uh, Fino in there was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I never had my hands on the rapture
kill, but you know, that would obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: be it, but I never actually got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get some seeds and I later crossed
those to NL AK 47 and made some,
[SPEAKER_02]: some really good hybrids that I would love
to have those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was growing those and, um, in Colorado
and like 99, 2000 and I'll, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: AK by super silver haze crossed into the
rapture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had two Finos back then and anyone I
smoked them with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, would admit that they were one
hit shit and I'd have to say those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately I've lost all the seeds from
that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so who's, uh, some breeders you'd love
to do a collab with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, Bodie, uh, CSI top dog, um,
keeping a camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, those are guys that, you know,
have to put in and work for years and I
[SPEAKER_02]: highly, highly recommend, you know,
respect them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you could go back in time to
anywhere to get one land race strain or
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds, you know, from anywhere,
where would you go and what would you get?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'd probably be buying from sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see it's a bunch of hash plant and
black domino right when they were
[SPEAKER_02]: released.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it was, uh, you know, had to go for
a land race, I'd be in Afghanistan and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, like 1977 and the Hindu Kush
mountains, uh, close to, um, Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so final question, what are your top
traits you look for in a male when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he's got to be like, uh, the sisters
that are keepers, you know, if the sisters
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't keepers, I ain't going to fucking
breed with the male.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, keep them around for a long
time and torture them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just make sure he stands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure you can stand that test of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, don't, you know, put them
through the ringer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks so much for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I love talking about this
plant and it was a real pleasure to be
[SPEAKER_02]: here and talk with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're an amazing host.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait to meet up in session person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: A huge thank you again to Bob for sitting
down and talking to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be sure to check out coastal seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Particularly there's the upcoming release
of the Northern Lights lines through seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: here now.

[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
