for another episode of Not In My Bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: your number one place to get all the
latest news, hottest takes, deeper
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis on the current affairs within the
cannabis scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I'm joined by my co-host,
Mr. Mean Gene, and today we have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: friend back for another episode,
seeing as the first was so well received.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Not So Dog, thank you so much for
joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we doing, gentlemen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, doing good, doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening and good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, I want to know, what are you
guys smoking on?
[SPEAKER_02]: What you smoking on there, Francis?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my buddy just down the street
from me pulled down a bunch of his summer
[SPEAKER_01]: depths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he gave me like 10 different things
to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're about they got harvested maybe
a month ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like right at the point of like
being, you know, good at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a bunch of a little bit of he grew
a little bit of my sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew some lemon haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew some cookie hybrids, because
that's what the market is and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've just been puffing on all that
fresh weed that he was kind enough to want
[SPEAKER_01]: me to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what's been going down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I'm just hitting the point where I
had some plants that were at the top of my
[SPEAKER_02]: potential keeper list, and I wanted to
revedge them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went ahead and cut them a little bit
earlier than I would have normally
[SPEAKER_02]: probably let them like max out,
but they were good enough to really know
[SPEAKER_02]: what they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wanted to give the plants the best
shot at revudging, you know, because I
[SPEAKER_02]: like good results like they read that
really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't let them get all the way
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those first tops that I cut off,
there's probably like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe 20 of them or something that are
just like nice, you know, like long sticks
[SPEAKER_02]: of weed with just those nice pieces
building up to the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so hot this summer when they were
flowering that the very tops of the buds
[SPEAKER_02]: actually looked like they were like too
close to a grow light or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't look very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the buds that are right, I always like
the buds that are right a little lower
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's crazy because if I judged by what
the tip of the bud look like, I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: this shit all sucks, you know,
because it was like 100 plants were
[SPEAKER_02]: budding and getting close to finish week
six, week seven was 100 degrees,
[SPEAKER_01]: 105 degrees, 110 every day for like two
and a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, so now I'm pulling off like the
little branches that are the driest off of
[SPEAKER_02]: those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just bonging some of those to see
which ones are, are really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's like Hindu S ones,
which are really neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll be some types that I got one
that's kind of similar to like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's been so long to really say
for sure, but it's like kind of similar
[SPEAKER_02]: like to the effects, that kind of like
old, like Afghani with the really big
[SPEAKER_02]: features.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like was ugly in my grow,
but I can tell if I could grow it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that old, it's the purple list.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the fattest leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the whitest resin and it smells
like kind of like gelato without this,
[SPEAKER_02]: without the sweetness or the cookie part
quite of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like that kind of like old Mendo
humble Afghani smell, but not like monkey
[SPEAKER_02]: balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more gelato-y, but it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one I really like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's looking like it's going to
revenge and and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like random other Hindu hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are all the ones that I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like my fresh weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as they dry, like it's a lot easier to
keep up with sampling them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, okay, this one's dry enough to
smoke and this one, let's try these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as they go, because at a certain
point I'll wind up swamped and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, now there's 600 plants to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, you kind of have to
sniff your way through the wires and see
[SPEAKER_02]: what's the most promising.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because, you know, it just gets like
overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right at the beginning, it's cool
because there's more, you see the identity
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I'm at right now with
this time of year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually puffing on some abracadabra
from my buddy, Eli Cash, who I did a
[SPEAKER_00]: little collab with making this one,
but he's done an awesome job growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Sour TK crossed to Chem Sister
by Neville Hayes, which comes from Wicks
[SPEAKER_00]: Family Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really like chem sort of structure
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there'd be a bit more sativa
influence in it, but like, I guess the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour TK is just such a solid looking
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to my buddy, Eli.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually got a seed company called
Local Birdseed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone should check that out as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into our first story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can navigate us to the
right screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to bring this up first because
it's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glasshouse Mountains, famous for being
CEO'd by the former law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: officer, Kyle Kazin, who advertised
himself as a drug detection and
[SPEAKER_00]: eradication specialist when he used to be
in the service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glasshouse has backed down from their
legal claim against cannabis, sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: catalyst CEO, Elliot Lewis, after Lewis
made claims that they felt were
[SPEAKER_00]: defamatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accusing Glasshouse of selling their
cannabis product into unlicensed cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glasshouse has withdrawn the defamation
claim, but still vehemently denies the
[SPEAKER_00]: statement, citing that they've just
analyzed the situation and they don't feel
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in their financial interest to pursue
the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the only reason they're
withdrawing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't feel like they're going to
be able to get enough money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they even went so far as to say that
they think pursuing this case would end up
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the cost of the product passed
on to the end consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their overall philosophy is to offer
the lowest price possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess this does make me wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this suggest that maybe they weren't
able to prove that their product was not
[SPEAKER_00]: making it into unlicensed cannabis
markets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we believe them that it simply just
wasn't financially worth their time to
[SPEAKER_00]: pursue the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we think?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I have a lot of thoughts on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I will freely admit that I did not
read all of the legal filings by any
[SPEAKER_01]: means.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did follow it because it is it is
interesting how all this kind of stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: shaking out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, what is Glasshouse supposed to
do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you get Elliott goes out there and
says, you're one of the largest black
[SPEAKER_01]: marketeers in American history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have to sort of act outraged,
especially if you're one of the larger,
[SPEAKER_01]: larger black marketeers in history.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you really have to sort of like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I I would say that that
Glasshouse was created for federal
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of the big, big farms
made a play in California that federal
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization would come faster than it
has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just not the market to absorb
all these giant farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the question becomes like,
where do all these giant farms excess go
[SPEAKER_01]: to?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a great unanswered California
question right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just Glasshouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something like 1600 licensed acres
in Santa Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glasshouse isn't even in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like in Ventura or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I had to guess what happened,
is that neither company really wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: discovery or a bunch of like on record
digging around and what's going on behind
[SPEAKER_01]: the scenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because California legal is like it's it's
a little weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, as far as Glasshouse goes,
obviously, their products make it all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of places they shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, whether or not they have
plausible deniability or whether or not
[SPEAKER_01]: they know or don't know, you know,
they're obviously never going to admit
[SPEAKER_01]: that they know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to act shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a way, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like I but but I mean,
I I'll tell you that probably like if you
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at all the legal sales in
California, probably like one or like 100
[SPEAKER_01]: acre farm could probably supply most of
California's needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start adding up one huge farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all the little legacy farms and then
all the like two, three, four,
[SPEAKER_01]: five hundred lighters around and stuff
that are licensed like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a big thing with
Glasshouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has 100 acres and it in greenhouses and
it pops off multiple rips a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where does it go?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's essentially the fight between
catalyst and Glasshouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: As he just called out the where does it go
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, like numbers wise,
I mean, I don't know anything about how
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's everybody's, you know,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't crunch the numbers with any of
that, but I do know that like one of my
[SPEAKER_02]: buddies up here is like the number two
wholesaler in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he buys all of his weed from small
farms and he buys it at a very low price.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sells it at a very low price.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what he does is he buys like
quality outdoor and debt, mostly debt.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, whatever is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he sells eighths and he doesn't have
fancy marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He basically has weed that is consistently
what we would consider to be pretty good
[SPEAKER_02]: weed from people who have been growing
weed for a long time, people who we would
[SPEAKER_02]: know from the old days and basically buys
untrimmed weed for a hundred dollars a
[SPEAKER_02]: pound and comes in and takes everything
from people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's basically from people who
otherwise wouldn't be able to sell weed at
[SPEAKER_02]: all and would have quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they wind up still having a fairly
functional business because it's not that
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to grow a thousand pounds when
nobody's trying to stop you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can grow a hundred pounds and a
thousand pounds and not have to trim it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sell it for a hundred dollars a pound,
then it's not so bad compared to being
[SPEAKER_02]: completely out of the game, like a lot of
people are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's actually, him and his brother have
been able to keep people in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't know any of this was going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been going on for years, but I didn't
know it even existed until I was talking
[SPEAKER_02]: to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, yeah, you know,
we're doing good and I'm proud of my
[SPEAKER_02]: brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, he's good, good,
really good at business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really good at finding the good
weed and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, nobody like for me,
like I don't want to, I don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to grow weed for a hundred
dollars a pound, but some people it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it actually gives them something they can
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now imagine that the guy who is the
number two provider of weed in California
[SPEAKER_02]: to all the shops buys all his weed from
guys like us who probably the bigger of
[SPEAKER_02]: them only grow maybe a ton of weed a year,
which sounds a lot if you don't grow a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of weed, but if you grow a lot of weeds,
you laugh at a ton of year, a ton of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew people in Humboldt who were pumping
out five tons a year under prop two 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were making a dent in any kind of
a market, but in the legal market within
[SPEAKER_02]: California trapped within these boundaries
that you have to stay within my buddy
[SPEAKER_02]: who's buying weed from small farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is number two in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he is truly legit getting weed from
the small farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who people like Gavin Newsom said would be
the people who would provide all the weed
[SPEAKER_02]: to everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then other than them who are number
two, who are probably buying, supplying
[SPEAKER_02]: the second most amount of weed in all of
the state with probably a pretty small
[SPEAKER_02]: acreage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine they're probably buying all
their weed from, you know, 20 acres worth
[SPEAKER_02]: of people at the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now when you're saying these numbers,
like 160 acres in one County, we're 1600
[SPEAKER_01]: acres in one County as 1600, 1600 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: So glass house isn't even in Santa
Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in Ventura.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even count towards that total.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just, just imagine that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are they, so are they, so these other
guys who have whatever they have five
[SPEAKER_02]: times as much the acreage as who's number
two, where's the, they're, they're all
[SPEAKER_02]: number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they all number one together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they, and how is number just,
if you think about the numbers,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's basically what,
yeah, I don't know how the CEO would rant
[SPEAKER_01]: about is he would just scream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he has all the numbers and he put
them up on his whiteboard because he's in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry and he knows what sales are.
[SPEAKER_01]: He goes and looks at like, it's all
public.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I will say maybe I'll say this
before I forget about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just came out recently that glass
houses announced they're making a big move
[SPEAKER_01]: into hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is curious because it comes right
after like the catalyst going,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are you doing with this hundred acres
of greenhouses and weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And hemp is something that they can
actually sell on all 50 states.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe it's THC a hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there might, so there might be a
situation where they pivot because like my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion is, is that if you set up a huge
scene intending on things going national,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't sell enough in the legal
California market to sustain itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're burning investor money and how
many years can you burn investor money?
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have investors that are like,
Oh, we'll wait it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one year turns into three turns into
four and they just keep burning and they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
And I mean, that's the question.
The hemp, the hemp thing is really
interesting because I keep hearing people
talking about, Oh yeah, we would THC a
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we'll ever know because
they dropped the lawsuit on, on,
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't want to move it forward,
but, um, they changed their practices
[SPEAKER_01]: after the lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause now they're going big into hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, that's the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hemp, the hemp thing is really
interesting because I keep hearing people
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, THC a hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, well, um, we before
you heat it up in general, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had stuff that if it's, you know,
the certain strains, it sits around for a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you'll, you'll start to see some,
some numbers, uh, that aren't THC a,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in general, when you see people's weed
get tested, it's just all THC a.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard there's laws, dude,
that they might block the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: From hemp as a pathway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they already have is what's crazy
is that it's this, it's this little detail
[SPEAKER_02]: of people going, well, it's THC a.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, I mean, my whole Al
Luida grows THC a hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like OG Kush, you heard of that THC a
hemp, sour diesel, pretty good THC a hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like until it has actually turned into,
to Delta nine, which only happens
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and it doesn't generally happen
while it's in the field, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all the funny thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now what's really weird was I go to,
I go to, um, the store in Willets where I
[SPEAKER_02]: buy dog food and on the counter is a thing
that is THC Delta nine hemp edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I've heard of Delta eight
and I know that that's a trippy trick with
[SPEAKER_02]: the hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Delta nine edibles on the counter at a
store that has no kind of anything there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I don't know if it's a typo or
what, but like, this is just weed guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the regulation I'm like, what's even,
what are, what the fuck is anybody doing
[SPEAKER_02]: right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy to see like, okay, THC a hemp
THC Delta nine edibles of the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, it's just like,
I don't know the whole, the whole thing's
[SPEAKER_02]: really weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of clarity on what the,
um, the real lines and, and these of all
[SPEAKER_02]: of it are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all this to say that, yeah,
I mean, like, you know, like if you're,
[SPEAKER_02]: if hemp is easier to produce and hemp,
you can ship nationwide, then like,
[SPEAKER_02]: or, you know, then just ship whatever weed
nationwide and say it's THC eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it probably is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm, I'm sure at a certain point
they'll go wait THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, back in the day, they're like,
Oh no, this isn't cannabis sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a little while people got away
with being like, no, no, no, look at these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants are not the illegal one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is cannabis Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't even want to talk about it,
except that it's so ridiculous that it
[SPEAKER_02]: even exists that there's no way it has any
legs on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The timeframe here is like the windows
gotta it's the windows already basically
[SPEAKER_02]: gotta be closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's happened to certain people in
certain places already, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, the whole thing's weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really a weird, weird time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, everybody can always
figure out some kind of a trippy loophole
[SPEAKER_02]: and then everybody just blows it out and
then it's shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, by the time I know about it,
cause I'm not involved in any of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it's, it's gotta be shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see how this is going to keep,
um, going like that, but Hey, great way to
[SPEAKER_02]: pivot right now to go, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The funny part about that would even be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is if they just kept doing what they were
doing, but then they just brought it above
[SPEAKER_01]: board and they're like, oh yeah,
we're shipping it everywhere, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole time that as long as we've had
a hemp permit, we've been shipping THCA
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then it's like, Oh,
what kind of THC hemp?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't know runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would, I would, and the only closing
thought I really have on it would
[SPEAKER_01]: basically be is that glass houses is a
funny name to be talking about or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, because the California wheat
industry is kind of a glass house where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not supposed to look around certain
corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, there's a blind eye turned to
like a lot of the inefficiencies and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of just the reality of what they've
created, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so, yeah, I think that,
um, uh, obviously glass house is not like
[SPEAKER_01]: us, you know, well, whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not stocked by people like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of the people that are trying
to come in and take it from us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they might've just timed it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they opened up glass house and an
already sat completely saturated
[SPEAKER_01]: California market when all the news was
already on how much more supply there was
[SPEAKER_01]: than demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they brought a hundred acres of
greenhouse on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they obviously, I think they
thought that legalization was a good
[SPEAKER_01]: chance within a year or two, and it's just
stretched.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're stretched.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're not returning their money
to, I think there's a bunch of not just
[SPEAKER_01]: glass house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a bunch of huge California
cannabis companies that their investors
[SPEAKER_01]: are starting to get nervous about the lack
of returns and the money expended.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could see a lot of weirdness in the
next five or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as that shakes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's some of the biggest,
you've already seen it, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we already, um, I think the last one we
already talked about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: met men gone biggest, the biggest,
the biggest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to, they own Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go everywhere you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the, those are the stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to get something pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ask somebody, where's the store?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the store and they're shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's by us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one was done.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the biggest one up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one that was like 275 million they
raised, you know, and then we talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: before, I think cookies and cookies,
investors getting all mad at them and
[SPEAKER_01]: different lawsuits filed and then dropped
quickly, kind of like this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where there's a lot of money flushing
around and there's not a lot of money
[SPEAKER_01]: being made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all, yeah, it's those huge,
those huge machines, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, I'm talking about my buddy,
um, who comes from a family who's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like his, his dad's like,
like a world famous weed guy from like the
[SPEAKER_02]: sixties from down south, like the whole,
like all kinds of lore in their family and
[SPEAKER_02]: all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, that he got into it and I didn't,
you know, I always see him doing his
[SPEAKER_02]: little hustle and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never talked to him and knew what
was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, yeah, we basically were
selling weed to stores by the eighth,
[SPEAKER_02]: buying it by the pound, buying it really
cheap by the pound, selling it really
[SPEAKER_02]: cheap by the eighth and it's good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't do any of the fancy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't even, they don't even white
label it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They put it in the stores on the shelves
and they're simple little bags and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: the best value.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good value weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is actually working and it's
keeping all these little farmers going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they actually still have pretty good
income relative to what's going on for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're really, really big in the
scheme of what is actually going on at the
[SPEAKER_02]: stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, the same with some of the buddies
like from up in, um, humble, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, um, you know, like, uh, TOEFL up
there, redwood, redwood roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they put together little stuff and,
uh, what's the other one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Humble, homegrown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're able to like, just keep
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always like, you'll see these
posts where he's like, dude, I'm losing my
[SPEAKER_02]: mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so stressed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like tearing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like pretty soon he's back.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, all right, I figured something
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're like keeping it going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like the nature of like
reality, but it's not reality when people
[SPEAKER_02]: come in and they're just like,
oh yeah, we're going to be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be the, you know,
the Amazon, a weed or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, good luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think that you can just keep
dumping money endlessly into doing all
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't even mean like within
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, go ahead and figure out
whatever, however you can make it work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't think that it's sustainable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it does work, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a trick because, um, you know,
that's like the, from the outside,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what everyone thinks is the thing
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's even, you know, like it was,
I probably back around the time when
[SPEAKER_02]: medical came in in the early two
thousands, I started telling my friends,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dude, going small is the new
way to go big now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going big is just such a huge risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get screwed and you get
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, basically like,
okay, do you want to, it's like the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between getting a job painting
houses and being like, dude, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: go to the casino with everything I got and
put it all on one number, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm out, you know, but then somebody else
is just doing their job and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything seems okay to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are going through these huge
pushes and these huge things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like the people who are like,
ah, it's kind of rough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of broke, but they just keep
plugging along.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they, they can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like, it's like, that's what's real
life, you know, as bad as it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, when prop 64 passed, if they would
have kept the acre cap, it would have kept
[SPEAKER_01]: all this giant waste of money from being
poured in long before it was ready for
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of investment anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the only thing that I saw when
they first did that is I know how people
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would have been like, as soon as
they were like, Oh, there'll be a one acre
[SPEAKER_02]: cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's going to be a lot of names on
paper that are all vaguely.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really look into it, they're
actually all the same thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like somebody would be holding a hundred
permits and they would be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like we, you remember like in the
days of medical people would be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, dude, I have 1300 scripts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went down and collected all of them and
I got all these patients and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, you'd like talk to
somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might have the same 1300 scripts,
you know, like, you know, really,
[SPEAKER_01]: I called it the paper shield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if they landed, it was like,
you bring out your paper shield and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I got, I'm safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on base.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and you know, that was still in those
cases.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's weird is like a lot of
people can grow a couple of tons of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: People smoke a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's, you know, it's
perishable and it's consumable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you have things like that,
you can be like, yeah, we can produce a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of products and it can still,
you know, be used as opposed to if you
[SPEAKER_02]: were, you know, you really have to
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Supply when you have something that's
like, you know, like, like diamonds,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you just have them all out and they're
all over the place, then it's just going
[SPEAKER_02]: to, everything's going to crash.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people could do, people could have a
lot of weed relative to demand and it
[SPEAKER_02]: would still be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at a certain point, he just,
it's just stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, like it's,
it's trippy because I think in the legal
[SPEAKER_02]: market, there's probably a small enough
pool of people who, if they were clever
[SPEAKER_02]: enough and they really could understand
like the nature of fucking everything or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything for that matter, they'd be like,
Hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: We could completely control the price
because we are the biggest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since they're big enough to control
the price, what did they do?
[SPEAKER_02]: They drop it out the floor and
overproduce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, when you were able to have
such a limited pool of production,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's only so many people with huge
permits.
[SPEAKER_02]: All those guys could go, Hey, let's put,
let's put 95% of our permit to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's follow it and let's just make the
price go through the roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe they will eventually when they
get enough control.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think, I think no matter what,
they're still going to all just be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: how, how do we make more $30 pounds of
weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like through the, up to the, up to the
moon, they're just going to try to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: without ever thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you know, it seems like that
would be impossible that they would do
[SPEAKER_02]: that, but they've already done so much of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me wonder, you know, it's a
tsunami of meds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the, it's the tsunami of meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably have chatted that one to
death.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I expect more lawsuits between
more people fighting in California over
[SPEAKER_01]: the next five or 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just, this is just the first wave
of arguments about how it's all going.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now look, the whole time we've been
chatting, I've been thinking, I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to draw us back to the original
question for a moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels a bit like in the first episode,
I think we were talking about how this
[SPEAKER_00]: issue was like the emperor's wearing no
clothes, you know, like we know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know this weeds going somewhere and we
see a lot of weed popping up somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my question is now that
someone's finally called it out and
[SPEAKER_00]: seemingly nothing is going to happen as a
result, do we think glass house product
[SPEAKER_00]: will just continue and nothing will
happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we think is actually going to
happen if anything, or do we think
[SPEAKER_00]: business as usual?
[SPEAKER_01]: I might get a little conspiratorial here,
I suppose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the, I think the reason why a
drug cop is one of the top people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: company is because it buys immunity from
other, like they, they're kind of a click
[SPEAKER_01]: and a club.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't go after their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And despite that, I also think that there
is just a big push in California to like
[SPEAKER_01]: not expose anyone big because those people
pay a lot in fees and overhead and taxes
[SPEAKER_01]: and all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just don't want to admit that the
system that they developed isn't working
[SPEAKER_01]: very well or as designed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of mismanagement
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, you know, I mean,
some of those farms in Santa Barbara
[SPEAKER_01]: probably pay the state over a million
dollars just in license fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, you know, small farms pay
a tiny amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be a big amount to that small
farm, but like the bigger places like
[SPEAKER_01]: really spend a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's all this investor money
pouring in and there's all this taxes
[SPEAKER_01]: getting made and all these local
municipalities are making money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like a, I almost see it as
like a financial bubble that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: burst.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this might be getting off target for
a second, but imagine, right, when federal
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization does come, there's a bunch of
states that have a lot of infrastructure
[SPEAKER_01]: money spent on their personal legalization
that aren't going to be able to compete
[SPEAKER_01]: with other states because of their climate
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like seriously, like,
are you like, you know, are you really
[SPEAKER_01]: going to, are you really going to have a
bunch of outdoor in New York compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: California or Southern Oregon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like every other crop we grow in this
country, we'll probably find out where the
[SPEAKER_01]: most advantageous place to grow it is
based on the climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll get shipped everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason why people are growing in
Missouri and New York and Maine and here
[SPEAKER_01]: and there and everywhere else mostly is
because it's a state by state thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it all has to happen within that
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think each state has been sucking up
a whole bunch of investment and like build
[SPEAKER_01]: out money and blue collar and unions
getting built and electricians and
[SPEAKER_01]: construction and all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, you know, is that
stuff going to persist once there's
[SPEAKER_01]: competition from Arizona and California
and places where it's sunny and dry every
[SPEAKER_01]: day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I doubt it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's like a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like, I think it's like a
state by state money grab in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause each state is building out,
but like think, think about it on a
[SPEAKER_01]: different level, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't grow citrus in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grew it in Orange County in Florida,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you go crops where they're suited.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then related to, to the legality of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing of state by state,
like during alcohol prohibition,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a time when there were certain
counties in certain places where you could
[SPEAKER_02]: pay the local authorities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could basically bribe them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could operate your operation
there legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the value wasn't as high there
because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once you took it somewhere else,
your alcohol gained huge amounts of value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it's like one of those
things where even now, although there's
[SPEAKER_02]: real regulation on these smaller levels
and people are like, oh, well it's state's
[SPEAKER_02]: rights and you know, county rights,
city rights, which all that is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, if you really look
at it, it's kind of like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: but being that it's not really legal,
legal, it's really kind of just a big
[SPEAKER_02]: extortion plot.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at it in relation to how
things were during that time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you go, well, what's the difference
really is you get some paperwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really mean anything because
it's not really, you know, it's not really
[SPEAKER_02]: legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, it is, it is in a different
sense, but you know, the whole thing of it
[SPEAKER_02]: being these little place by place thing is
it's like, it's all kind of, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of like, you're just paying to
do a crime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, why is it a crime?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's doesn't, that's the biggest
thing I've never understood is you hand
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody a piece of paper and now it's not
immoral anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so it's illegal because it's
dangerous and immoral.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole reason why weed is
illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you give somebody a permit to
grow it and sell it, then all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_02]: it becomes like, fine, totally fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to tie into one of our
segments of, of you know, when it's legal,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, seeing as, seeing as the cat has
been led out of the bag, we will move on
[SPEAKER_00]: to our next discussion point, which is
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I, am I quick?
[SPEAKER_00]: The LA times has published an article
where they have slammed a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely well-known popular high cannabis
companies, accusing them of being riddled
[SPEAKER_00]: with pesticides, as well as being quite
substantially off in regards to the stated
[SPEAKER_00]: potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The end conclusion is pretty much that a
lot of the weed being sold by some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these top companies is basically being
given to them by the same brokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The weed is sort of sold between them,
sold to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then they basically end up selling
it to the user.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the question becomes, is this
really that surprising?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something we truly didn't expect,
so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that all the, I don't want
to say like cannabis insiders or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: but no, I don't think it's surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly is 180 degrees around their
rhetoric of what they thought the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences were going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but no, I wouldn't say it was
surprising at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I think that, um,
I mean, for one thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, we should say there's a lot of
brands that are not vertically integrated
[SPEAKER_01]: and do, do not grow and control their
product from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they source source material,
whether that's flower crude or distillate
[SPEAKER_01]: or like whatever it might be, they have a
brand and there's a lot of brands that
[SPEAKER_01]: like, they might have like business
arrangements with farms, but they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: run the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just buying on the open market,
like stuff that meets their criteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a result of that, the cheapest
weed that you can buy for your brand is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably some of these huge farms that we
were just talking about, because they have
[SPEAKER_01]: the most volume so they can offer it at
the lowest price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those large farms have a tendency to
just, they want to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whether they're spraying stuff
themselves or whether there's another
[SPEAKER_01]: large farm next to them that's growing
conventional stuff that gets sprayed or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, any number of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis has much more stringent testing
requirements than our food.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you start growing in an ag land
surrounded by that kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the chance for it being contaminated
is high.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even a lot of these farms I should
mention that, um, their ground is
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminated and will be for decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as like stuff that tests hot for
cannabis, you could grow cauliflower on it
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever and probably be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for cannabis, there's a lot of banned
pesticides for cannabis that is just
[SPEAKER_01]: persistent in ag land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these huge farms are all growing on
old ag land for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it doesn't surprise me at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because most of these brands are
probably not sourcing it from small
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That have less of a chance of using some
of that funky stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably buying it on a much
larger market in bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a quick side point,
I wanted to add, cause someone actually
[SPEAKER_00]: asked me, why is it that like,
you can use certain pesticides and even
[SPEAKER_00]: like PGRs on certain edibles and whatnot,
but like it's so bad on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, many of you will be
aware of this, but it's just as simple as
[SPEAKER_00]: like, because cannabis has ended up being,
you know, volatized or vaporized in some
[SPEAKER_00]: form, it's, it's going to get directly
into your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a lot of these products,
when they're on the surface of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato or whatever, you eat it,
it doesn't really get absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's not as concerning,
but just a quick little tidbit I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: throw in, but Mr. Mean Gene, fill us in on
your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could actually add something before I
forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of cool about what you just
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this product that I don't like
at all called Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fungicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why they approve it for
food is they say the chemical is broken
[SPEAKER_01]: down by your stomach really quickly,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you burn it, you know, flour that
has it on it, it creates a by-product of
[SPEAKER_01]: cyanide, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so obviously you don't want to be
inhaling hot cyanide on any level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, and then too, I think,
which is good, I think cannabis has a
[SPEAKER_01]: stricter testing regimen and that our food
should move and probably in that same
[SPEAKER_01]: direction too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like they made it more strict,
but that's positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we should be moving away from a lot of
those harsh chems and our food supply as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you do that, it gives people
an incentive to try to figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with the way that,
um, the legalization and regulation went
[SPEAKER_02]: is that it's leaning towards that big ag
model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's saying, where you use all these
crazy harmful chemicals and they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: made for combustible products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're made for, uh, consumable,
edible products.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you eat things, your digestive
tract is really impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you drink chlorinated water,
very little chlorine goes in your system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you bathe or swim in chlorinated
water, you can absorb a lot more,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like the, there's, there's a
difference between how everything works in
[SPEAKER_02]: your lungs, really take things in super
gnarly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you could eat small amounts of
things that are really toxic in your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll deal with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, your body has your kidneys as
your liver, as these different systems of
[SPEAKER_02]: filtration and purification and your,
your, um, you know, everything in your gut
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything that lives in your gut,
but your lungs are just this clean area of
[SPEAKER_02]: something that just everything goes
straight into your blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Through your lungs, basically,
because they're meant to take in the
[SPEAKER_02]: oxygen and the oxygen has to readily be
sucked into your lungs, which makes
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking weed.
Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you smoke it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that should be mentioned about
that is that right after that,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that oxygenated oxygenated blood goes
straight to your heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever's going in there is going to
your heart as fast as your body can get it
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then pushed around the rest of your
body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it pumps through your whole body.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it, and then it winds up after
that, going through the filtration after
[SPEAKER_02]: it gets into your blood, you know,
where, so it's an interesting difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the, um, the question of was it,
is it a surprise is it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, if you, if you want to get things from
the biggest producers of something that's
[SPEAKER_02]: a plant, anybody who grows knows the
bigger you go, the more likely you are to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a failure of your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the bigger the failure, the more
costly it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people find out that, okay,
we're about to lose this whole crop and
[SPEAKER_02]: this crop is eight tons of weed or
whatever it is, they're like, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: so can we get away with this stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this going to, do you think this is
going to pass testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they grow the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hit it with something really nasty
and they get all the way to the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're left with all this tainted
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't test a whole batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can only test a sample from the batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, is this sample from the batch?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: The samples from the batch, you know,
we would never, uh, take a sample from a
[SPEAKER_02]: different batch that we know is a hundred
percent clean that we got from a much
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller producer or from a different
section where we had a little bit of weed
[SPEAKER_02]: that wasn't even supposed to be sold,
but Hey, we know it's at least clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, maybe sometimes that is,
or even like, even like, uh, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: certain banned things that get pulled out
when you just turn it into distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, if you're knowing that you're
growing a big ass field just for basically
[SPEAKER_01]: for disti, as they call it, like you might
even be able to like hit your stuff with
[SPEAKER_01]: some nasty chems because you think it's
all going to get pulled out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just, it's just being,
it's one of those things where it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it almost makes me feel like it's like
with food or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, don't ask how the sausage was
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a lot of rules and regulations right
now are sort of bumping up against the
[SPEAKER_01]: reality of what people want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the pesticide thing and the
herbicides and all that, like people just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't realize that, like when I met a
bunch of people in big ag that I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: were going to crush us, I didn't realize
how reliant they were on all these chems
[SPEAKER_01]: and their toolkit to be able to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they almost felt helpless when some of
these chems and some of these,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, banned pesticides or whatever
are removed because they've literally
[SPEAKER_01]: leaned on them their whole career and they
don't have another method to solve
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever problem it might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, they almost get insulted
when they find out they can't use it on
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, um, as far as the,
as far as the tea HC inaccurate testing
[SPEAKER_01]: goes, as long as there's a marketplace
that stupidly is basing pricing on THC
[SPEAKER_01]: content, there's been a THC creep,
um, w you know, for going on for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time now, and it's, it's just going to
continually get worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the other thing I should say
too, is that, um, some of these big farms,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're the, they're the lab's biggest
clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lab, the lab might be testing for
THC and terpenes and all their pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: and herbicide and heavy metals testing and
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of these huge farms, like
literally like could be the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between like a lab surviving or not,
because they're getting hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of dollars from this company so
that everything's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like, it's not independent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I guess what I'm saying,
and there's a vested interest within
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple parties to get a result.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how I look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever seen this documentary about
the Russian doping in the Olympic called
[SPEAKER_02]: Icarus?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I haven't no, no, I'm not really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you watch it and basically it just is a
great example of how, when you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you have organizations that are
established, and exist over time,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything kind of keeps up the same
pace and status quo over a long period of
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They start to gain this relationship where
everybody knows how everything works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a while, it's not hard to game
the system in one way or another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not also, if things are in place
long enough, then you actually insert your
[SPEAKER_02]: own people into these organizations to
make sure, you know, that's how police
[SPEAKER_02]: corruption often works.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how, you know, you might be able to
get, you know, a judge or a DA or a
[SPEAKER_02]: Congress person or whatever it is that you
need to be able to put these things in
[SPEAKER_02]: place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, in our, in our, you know,
the greater system of the United States,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not uncommon to see that,
oh, the guy who used to work for Monsanto
[SPEAKER_02]: and sell Roundup now, he's the guy at the,
at the FDA or the USDA, or there's all
[SPEAKER_02]: these conflicts of interests that arrive
naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like in this documentary, you see that
it's like they were able to figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: like the unbeatable system.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way around this system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're like, yeah, we,
we know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really want to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and so they, they basically gamed the
system and figured out a way to where they
[SPEAKER_02]: could, they could tamper with these
samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they would you know, they would
just do this little, just this little
[SPEAKER_02]: dance that was really simple, you know,
and they were able to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, that's naturally always going
to happen with any kind of a testing
[SPEAKER_02]: organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: At a certain point, you're going to get
bad actors in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not to say even that I have so
much a problem with that type of
[SPEAKER_02]: corruption, because it's not so much to
me, it's not the issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the fact that they, the
regulators are going to pretend that
[SPEAKER_02]: everything is completely bulletproof.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know exactly what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to make all the growers
jump through all these hoops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in reality, anybody who wants to game
the system can game the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the people who want to be honest
are just going to be like, all right,
[SPEAKER_02]: we just have a bunch of hoops to jump
through that only keep us from doing bad
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not the guys who are going to
use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to use the pesticides,
but we still have to test for them to show
[SPEAKER_02]: that our stuff's clean when anyone who
knows us knows it's clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these guys who you just obviously know
are going to be the ones with the dirty
[SPEAKER_02]: weed, because you see how they're how much
weed they're growing a scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the guys who are going to wind
up faking the test test testing this,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't even have to do any of this
shit like in the movie that I'm talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just give the lab a sample of some
weed they already know is clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, this is the batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, OK, we tested the batch,
you know, and they can just test the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can just put one clean pound of weed
away that has super high THC and go,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the test for all of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they can go, oh, and here's the
sample for the turps here if they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the sample for the I mean,
and they can do it like that if they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole system's a joke, you know,
essentially what the LA Times found is
[SPEAKER_01]: that real world testing showed far
different results than the piece of paper
[SPEAKER_01]: that you needed to show to make sure that
you were approved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a vast discrepancy between
getting the piece of paper that allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: you to make the sale within the legal
system because you and now you have
[SPEAKER_01]: plausible deniability too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you didn't know you tested
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't sell dirty stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tested it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came back clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, their test was clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who knows what happened here in the
middle?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it could it be that brand had dirty
equipment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they dirtied our weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you have when you have smaller
producers and all the weeds coming from
[SPEAKER_02]: them, it's like there's not even they
don't they don't even really have the
[SPEAKER_02]: incentive to want to use all of these
chemicals because there's just not really
[SPEAKER_02]: very much use for them because you don't
have anything that gets that far outside
[SPEAKER_02]: of what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I grow weed, like any thing that
I can't that I get is either like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to take a loss on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I know how to fix it with something
that's not harmful.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're looking and you're going,
oh, my God, we have all these acres,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to be like, all right,
what is what can I do for for fractions of
[SPEAKER_02]: a penny for a square foot?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what can we get?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they just game the testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that's just something that is
fully incentivized at large scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it would have been great for them
to really keep large scale for being able
[SPEAKER_02]: to operate because then you'd have good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you go to the farmers market.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people at the farmers market who
are selling organic produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a friend back in the day,
his family used to used to run big farms
[SPEAKER_02]: in California with produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would sell all their produce in
bulk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the kids to get money would get a
bunch of organic stickers and stamps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would take them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would load up their car and go to the
farmers market and sell all this
[SPEAKER_02]: conventional ag shit that was left over
from their family's operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd sit at the they'd sit at the
farmers market and sell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at a farmers market, they were the
they were the minority.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people at the farmers market,
you can like go up and check stuff out and
[SPEAKER_02]: you go, OK, I mean, one of the great
things that's funny at like a farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: market is if you go to like buy some
broccoli and it's got like three or four
[SPEAKER_02]: aphids on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they didn't use anything that bad
because these fuckers would have been
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked if they used the shit people are
spraying on these weed crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you can see that this is
like regular stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't look quite like the stuff at
the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the varieties are different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's these day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually you can trust the smaller
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's that there's still going to be
a certain aspect of funkiness to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like the reality was that the reason
these people I know had funky,
[SPEAKER_02]: not organic produce selling along with the
rest was because they were the guys who
[SPEAKER_02]: were growing conventional fields full of
food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in order to do that, like organic,
just it wasn't it wasn't unsprayed
[SPEAKER_02]: organically grown, you know, fed with
compost and green manure and manure and
[SPEAKER_02]: all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't practical for them at all
because they were at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for like my grandpa, who wants to have
like some crates of tomatoes, it's super
[SPEAKER_02]: easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't you don't ever have to spray
your tomatoes, but gopher eats like a
[SPEAKER_02]: quarter of your tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, dude, we still got so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you have a massive tomato farm,
you're under the gun.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we going to use?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it just is, you know, it's a
bummer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's no shock when you see that the
biggest guys are the ones using the most
[SPEAKER_02]: shit and they're in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that sucks about it is that
those are the most economical people for
[SPEAKER_01]: the brands to purchase the material they
need from because they have the largest
[SPEAKER_01]: volume and they can offer the most
aggressive pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of brands are gravitating
towards like the biggest farms because
[SPEAKER_01]: they have the cheapest stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you mentioned Glasshouse again,
they have been undercutting hard because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, these brands need these farms
need to sell stuff on the legal market,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they compete with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They compete with each other on how cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you come up here to Mendo or Humboldt
and people want one price, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's big groups down there that
like, you know, he was just saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, his friend will buy it wholesale
for 100 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that will sell it for 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one are they going to pick?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, I mean, if my if my buddies
didn't have a working model and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: not ethical the way that they are because
they're cool dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they weren't like that,
they could really easily just go,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, so right now, let's just let's leave
all these guys hanging for the hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's as low as they'll go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's just go ahead and go down there
and we'll buy this other weed for 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're not doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not going to change their
their pricing wholesale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just dropped their their overhead
a ton, two thirds almost basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, these guys who I'm talking
about by not doing that, they're probably
[SPEAKER_02]: missing out on another couple million
dollars a year or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these guys are killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a lot of money they're leaving
on the table to be ethical.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't expect everybody to make
that same sacrifice when they crunch the
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, you can expect more of that
from people who were the people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: really growing weed and actually,
like, have an attachment to the ethics of
[SPEAKER_02]: having a good product, because a lot of
people take pride in the fact that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: giving people the weed that's making them
feel better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they want to give people good,
clean weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these guys are still doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that there's no there's no reason for
these huge companies who don't come from
[SPEAKER_02]: any kind of cultural practice at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just crunch the numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go, it's cheaper to eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheaper to hit it with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheaper to hit it with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheaper to dry it in this many days.
[SPEAKER_02]: All this stuff just to get the prices
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're like, yeah, our numbers
are up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made more money, you know, and it's
like, well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's one of the reasons why a lot of
times weed was expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it was expensive, a lot of people
could have grown a lot more weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of the best growers,
friends of mine, they looked at it and
[SPEAKER_02]: they think, oh, we got a lot of space,
you know, but we don't have quality drying
[SPEAKER_02]: space for more than 80 or 120 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could build it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I tried to grow a little bit extra and
it like everything, the quality on
[SPEAKER_02]: everything was just not quite there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm topped out growing this
much weed and maybe they get some help and
[SPEAKER_02]: then grow a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when people really have pride and
shit, they're more likely to like want to
[SPEAKER_02]: stick to a real number that they know is
where things line up to be top notch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of people in the old days,
you know, we're like, OK, this is what I
[SPEAKER_02]: can.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I can manage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's still a lot of people like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like what these guys are buying
the weed from those guys, because because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a lot of people who are like,
we could grow twenty five hundred pounds
[SPEAKER_02]: of crap, but we're just going to keep
growing eight hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just going to keep growing,
you know, eleven hundred pounds of weed
[SPEAKER_02]: that's coming out like really how we want
it to come out, you know, because they're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that over three or four runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not all at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're having these batches that are
coming off and they're just, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a few hundred pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really manageable with a small
team of a few people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have the best weed like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it might not be quite like the
lady who, you know, who has one,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, six hundred watt light and
you're like, oh, I'll buy that to smoke or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still really good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know that when you're a huge scale
like that, it's just, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if the weed seems like it's its best,
it's going to fall off in one one way or
[SPEAKER_02]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's going to it's going to get
treated industrially by something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there could even be a thing and we
can move on again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is when you're growing at
large ag places, most of those places hire
[SPEAKER_01]: out their sprayers to come in and spray
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's even possibilities that like,
let's say that five days a week,
[SPEAKER_01]: these sprayers are out there hitting
conventional farms and using different
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they come on your farm and they
put in whatever they're going to spray
[SPEAKER_01]: that night.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's there's enough residue in the
lines, in the tank, in the sprayer and the
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's not even like a full dose,
but it's enough to pop enough one work and
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you that all those big
farms, most of them don't have all their
[SPEAKER_01]: own personal equipment and their own team
out there all night long.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hire it out as a service.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then what are those services doing
in there and all their equipment,
[SPEAKER_01]: all those other days a week?
[SPEAKER_01]: That they're spraying conventional farms
that are allowed to use all these camps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's even room for honest mistakes
where it's like, we didn't even want to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't happen to somebody like me who
was growing a, you know, 25 plants medical
[SPEAKER_02]: and had a bunch of weed on those plants
and they were beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just like, I didn't have to do
anything like, oh, one plants got tons of
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just fucking chop it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's not good enough, it ain't good
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?
[SPEAKER_02]: You got more, you know, and you don't
need, you don't have, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: when it's, you're losing your whatever 4%
right now by chopping this, it's not like
[SPEAKER_02]: you're losing 4% of, you know,
400,000 plants or whatever in that run.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, totally different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I think we've thoroughly,
I think we've thoroughly hashed that one
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's change the pace a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk a little bit about how
Germany recently passed an adult use bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you guys have heard about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, I think probably about six months
ago, maybe getting close to that now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's been reported that it has
absolutely opened the flood gate for
[SPEAKER_00]: Calipax flooding into Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anecdotal reports say that they're going
for 10,000 euro a pound It's not
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly surprising, but I guess the
question is, do we think other countries
[SPEAKER_00]: in the EU are going to follow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a follow up, do we think this might
be the first sign of a global cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: culture, which is essentially going to
eventually wipe out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of the individual cultures for a long
time, you know, there was sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch scene more recently, the Spanish
scene, but I mean, if you take it on face
[SPEAKER_00]: value, if California bud is dominating,
it's hinting that that may well be the
[SPEAKER_00]: global culture going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Californian cannabis culture will be
exported all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we think?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is kind of a theme,
I think of what we've been talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like every state in America so far
that goes legal, it's a grand mystery what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens to its excess, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is going to start going all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know that like when they opened
up Thailand last year, all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: there was all these California brands and
people and opening stores and there was
[SPEAKER_01]: jars of purple weed over there,
you know, and it wasn't all traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: Tao and Lai and Cambodian, you know,
sativas and that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it's going to go places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's just the nature of
like, you know, it's really sad,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like I was reading about how like,
you know, there's barely any Moroccan weed
[SPEAKER_01]: left in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all Dutch and Spanish imports and
they give them all, that's where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting their seed stock and that's what
they're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're turning that into hash
and then it's going back into Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think probably like, that's a
good time to say that rules are rules,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then there's always going to be,
if there's profit involves and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: this and that involved, there's always
going to be people bending them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds funny to think that like
America would have an excess of something
[SPEAKER_01]: that it would be smuggling into other
countries because we're usually the
[SPEAKER_01]: gobbler that just takes the world's supply
of substances and send it here for money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess we could reverse the stream
and start sending, you know, packs all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think every country and
every state that wants to legalize is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have to deal with the fact that
there's this robust underground,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I don't know how that's all
going to shake out, but it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: every place it's, it's every place it's
going to, it's going to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I want to imagine since
Holland is right next door, wouldn't there
[SPEAKER_01]: be a bunch of weed from Holland and
Switzerland that would start to pour into
[SPEAKER_01]: Germany?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like on a more, on a, on a, you know,
I mean, you'd think that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The production just can't keep up,
I wonder, but I guess I'm interested,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like historically the Dutch
scene, you know, people would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, you know, hazes and cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these more European orientated
varieties would generally be considered to
[SPEAKER_00]: be kind of the, the prevalent strains in
the zeitgeist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas you don't see that, you know,
it seems as though Cali like, let's just
[SPEAKER_00]: be blunt, like gelato runs these household
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like they're going to become the
dominant and synonymous names with these
[SPEAKER_00]: regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder if we'll lose that sort of
more localized culture that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I think historically.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to go back to what we were talking
about before, about huge farms
[SPEAKER_01]: overproducing is those things you just
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the reason why gelatos and runs
and these different things have swept so
[SPEAKER_01]: much is because the largest farms are
growing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's just more production of
those strengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the amount of that being grown just
dwarfs anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like once you've got a bunch of huge farms
growing purple candy gas, and all of a
[SPEAKER_01]: sudden purple candy gas starts showing up
in every market, legal and illegal and
[SPEAKER_01]: gray and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just floods what's out there to some
degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like whether or not people want
it, that's what's happening, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's only the weird thing about the
California market that people might not
[SPEAKER_01]: know is that most farms are flowering
farms and they end up buying their clones
[SPEAKER_01]: from a nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't get these huge lists where
they can just choose 50 or 80 strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most nurseries are like for the next four
months, these are the 12 strains we offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to be cutting clones off
them regularly and selling them repeatedly
[SPEAKER_01]: to all kinds of different farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's only so many big nurseries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few big nurseries and a few big
farms, if they decide to start to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things, all of a sudden it's all
jealousy, gelato, runs, various hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what most people see because
that's the vast volume being grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's the feedback loop too of
like, you know, it's like whatever is the
[SPEAKER_02]: most popular with people in general,
like, you know, it always, it always comes
[SPEAKER_02]: down to like, when people show up,
like when they're going to buy all the
[SPEAKER_02]: weed, what are they asking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when there starts to be a trend of
people going, oh, okay, well, we want
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then people are like, okay, I got to grow
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times it'll swing,
like people will finally catch onto the
[SPEAKER_02]: trend and they'll grow that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it'll be like, no, that's the old
shit now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, we're not going to grow that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to give you that money so
hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the weed takes so long to flower and
get processed and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times it'll be like,
oh, it's, you know, everybody wants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the original one really was,
boy, everybody wants purple oracle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then all of a sudden people started
showing up and they're like, no,
[SPEAKER_02]: we don't want that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only want sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people were like, no,
sour is not shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then people shift over to OG and then
people start being like, no, we don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then people had cookies and everybody
started going, no, no, we want sherbert.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kept going, you know, skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it went, we want ruts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we want lemon cherry gelato,
which is just ruts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like it kept going to the point
where now it's like, which ruts,
[SPEAKER_02]: which lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like this bag seed cut that is a
little bit more like this or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem with it is that when
people go to sell their weed, they have to
[SPEAKER_02]: have the weed that people want to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what people tend to want to buy is the
weed, you know, that the easiest thing to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand is always going to be what
sells the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you're not going to like make a
jazz album right now with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking, you know, math music,
where you have to like know the theory to
[SPEAKER_02]: know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like that shit to musicians is
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, oh, did you hear that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that would be like,
you know, me and Francis looking at some
[SPEAKER_02]: weird larpy haze hybrid that you smoke it
and you're like, oh, no, what have I done?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but like the market is going to
want, you know, bubblegum pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to want like the music that
is the most relatable, that's the most
[SPEAKER_02]: accessible and very weed is very pretty
looking and very frosty purple weed is
[SPEAKER_02]: very pretty looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it smells really good,
it smells really crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, whoa, that doesn't smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I expect weed to smell like, Hey,
and I expect it when it's really good to
[SPEAKER_02]: smell like, like kind of skunky and
fueling or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then people smell weed that smells
like crazy candy gas perp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, Whoa, this is just so
far from what I expected that it has this
[SPEAKER_02]: knee jerk reaction where people are like,
that's what I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then once they like it, they know what
they like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're just like people are
creatures that have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just stick to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when buyers show up, they're like,
they look at everything and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I just want the Obama runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want the lemon cherry gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even want to look at any of the
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You show it to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go, yeah, that's not it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they smell something to go,
that's got some of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they're talking about is just the
thing that they know really sold to them
[SPEAKER_02]: fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it becomes this endless feedback
loop where like the, the buyers want this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the grower wants this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the nursery supplies this and pretty
soon you get stuck in the loop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden then you get the
people who are like, I really want to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke some of that weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that shit I got back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, in the, in there like,
you know, fucking I don't, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke no fucking like blue dream or no
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, if you actually showed it
to them, they go, this is that shit from
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you go, yeah, that was the real blue
dream cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that's the weed that you liked
that you never could find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know, all that, you know,
blueberry haze when blue dreams stopped
[SPEAKER_02]: selling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you've never known what your
favorite weed is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course some people hate that weeds,
but some people hate ruts, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's, it's a trippy, you know,
it's a weird loop that people get stuck in
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one angle that we could talk about
for a second with Germany and then pop off
[SPEAKER_01]: to the next thing is that Germany is a
big, very populated, very wealthy country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for them opening up to weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they drop the penalties for weed quite
a bit, there could be this big demand of
[SPEAKER_01]: all these people that want cannabis,
but there's not the supply within Germany
[SPEAKER_01]: at all to give them that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's excess over here in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: So straight capitalism is just basically
like, oh, well there's excess over here
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's demand over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The invisible hand is going to come pull
it and there's going to find a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's probably temporary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably temporary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to bridge the gap
until Germany gets its own sort of little
[SPEAKER_01]: engine going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those prices will drop,
but probably what happened is they
[SPEAKER_01]: loosened the penalties, a huge surge in
demand, not that much supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the surge got the price up to a bunch
of people were like, Oh, I have a clever
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I could make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lo and behold, you know, the excess
gets to where the, the drought is.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's kind of, it's, it's,
it's like, that's like classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like Adam Smith that you learn in
grade school or whatever, about like how
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalism works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like alcohol prohibition,
you know, all of a sudden it was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, did you know Ireland is still
making stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we get that here?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they would bring it into Canada and
then over the lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use a, I'll use a right now weed
example, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was out in New York setting some
stuff up, when they went legal,
[SPEAKER_01]: they distill it was going for $8,000 a
liter in New York, but you could buy
[SPEAKER_01]: distill it for six or $700 a liter in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't think that there was some
entrepreneurs somewhere that made some
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap California distill it show up in
expensive New York past as New York
[SPEAKER_01]: distill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they made 10 times their money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People figured out how to do that on some
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what entrepreneur is looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going, okay, where's the,
where's the supply of something and the,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the market for something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when there's a difference,
then you're the one who comes in and
[SPEAKER_02]: capitalizes on the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a huge, you know, the huge thing
and that, that, yeah, but talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: the, talking about the, the way that
everything moved towards being like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's all, you know, like now the
market, the buyers, the growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: the nurseries, the runts, the lemon cherry
gelato, all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a smaller version of what I
think just kind of always is in it is
[SPEAKER_02]: happening all the time with, um,
cause what I didn't say about those things
[SPEAKER_02]: too, is that all those things are easier
to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't know that it's not
hard to produce weed that looks like the
[SPEAKER_02]: weed you want from those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you grow sour diesel, a good sour
diesel grower might tell you, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to be one or two out of four
runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, three or four out of five runs
that are going to come off the way you
[SPEAKER_02]: really want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you grow like gelato or a lot of
these things, like they just kind of come
[SPEAKER_02]: out how they come out pretty close.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're really easy to produce a
lot of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think, uh, worldwide, that's where
the trends have gone a lot over the years
[SPEAKER_02]: was it was like, okay, you have like this
weed, if you take it over here,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can grow it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can take weed from India, take it to
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: It grows really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you have this big supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it goes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that influences what everybody thinks
of as weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's their first in New York,
the first weed you got when in Miami,
[SPEAKER_02]: the first weed you got was this Jamaican,
you know, so you know what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that like sets a paradigm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then the California weed
started and it was like, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: what everyone can grow everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turns out are these Afghanis or these
Afghanis that are crossed with a Colombian
[SPEAKER_02]: or a Mexican or a tie or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that becomes the thing that's
easy to overproduce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that becomes the understood thing of
like, okay, so for production,
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to do something like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then everywhere you go,
everybody's constantly all around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, everybody's trying to always
keep up with, okay, what is the best way
[SPEAKER_02]: to do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And where does this thing work?
[SPEAKER_02]: And where does that thing work?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think like, now that everything's
been in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: for so long and the U.S., it takes up a
pretty big chunk of the, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically when you're looking at like the
area that it takes up, when you look at
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you go, okay, well, you can grow
pretty crazy weed in Southern California
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can't maybe grow in Montana,
but there's something you can grow
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: has become a place where it's a really
good place to figure out what the
[SPEAKER_02]: possibilities are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's going to be hard, I think,
to ever get out of what you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about, where it is going to dictate a lot
of the trends and it is going to dictate a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the greater, the world,
the weed world, because it's always been
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the United States has been a little
bit more successful with figuring out
[SPEAKER_02]: these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at the way that like
animal crops or grain crops, food crops
[SPEAKER_02]: were when you had like Eurasia,
you know, because now we go, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, you've got Europe over here and you
have Asia over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, well, when you look at the
map, it's all one place, just like the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States is all one place that
stretches from way over here to way over
[SPEAKER_02]: there, stretches from way up here to way
down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all of our, all of the food trends
and everything are the most, most,
[SPEAKER_02]: not all of them, but a lot of the most
popular ones all came from over there
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's like, this is this place
where you can grow these things over a big
[SPEAKER_02]: area and have a lot of, you know,
there's, there's a lot of like evolution
[SPEAKER_02]: going on with culture, with these
particular things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that happened a lot with weed in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I think like naturally Germany is
going to be more likely to mimic the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: than where else would they mimic like the
Congo or Southeast Asia, or it's like more
[SPEAKER_02]: likely whatever's the most successful is
going to continue to just be the model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I won't be surprised if everywhere
that, everywhere that sets up new
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization, a lot of them are going to
look to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and go, how did those guys do it over
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people will even look at
Columbia and Mexico, anywhere that people
[SPEAKER_02]: have been real successful with this
particular kind of crops going to be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, going to kind of set a lot of
the pace and all those places for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, look, we, we quickly referenced it
earlier in the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't we quickly touch on our next
story, which is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we spoke in one of the prior episodes
about Thailand reversing their stance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have done yet another reversal on
their reversal, signaling that they may
[SPEAKER_00]: indeed not re-criminalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is obviously a breath of fresh air
for many of the people who have set up
[SPEAKER_00]: operation over there after the initial
calls for banning it happened a few months
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not entirely clear what the new plan
exactly will be, but the overall message
[SPEAKER_00]: is that it's largely speaking going to
remain legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I'm wondering, do we think this
will stick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we think there might be yet another
U-turn on the U-turn on the U-turn?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an extension, do we think other
Asian countries will progress towards
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization or is this a sign of the
general instability?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was going to say it about
Germany, but I can say it about Thailand
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for obviously people that
believe what we do when large populous
[SPEAKER_01]: countries decide to like that their
approach to cannabis is misguided and they
[SPEAKER_01]: need to like, you know, decriminalize it,
legalize it, change their approach to it,
[SPEAKER_01]: treat it in a much better fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, I think these big countries
deciding to like, take it from,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a criminal side and be like,
oh, it's normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Thailand got scared because I can
tell you from just a bunch of people I
[SPEAKER_01]: know that as soon as they opened up,
they got flooded with foreigners looking
[SPEAKER_01]: to take advantage of the new weed rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of going to happen in
places as they open up is essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis people from oversaturated markets
are going to look at that and be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I could go there and kill it for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to flood in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to be honest, me and Jean and I
saw that happen in Mendo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like once people really, we passed this
law called measure G, which made us pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much like the most open place to grow weed
in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say starting about oh three or
oh four, like the flood gates opened of
[SPEAKER_01]: people moving here to blow it up and go
big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure the same thing happened in
Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It like overwhelmed all of a sudden they
went from like it always existed to like,
[SPEAKER_01]: holy crap, it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it caused our real estate to boom and
spike around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It created an enormous bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know literally probably over a dozen
people just personally that went to
[SPEAKER_01]: Thailand to blow it up and to,
and to, and to change these laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm sure there's, there was
thousands of people that went there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they probably got a bit freaked
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: At how fast things exploded, clamped down
for a minute, then realized they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really want to clamp down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just need to figure out a path
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's probably going to keep
happening because look at what we've just
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about 10 K weed in Germany,
Germany, like takes its foot off the gas a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden there's great,
like it's just going to keep happening
[SPEAKER_01]: until more and more of these places like
go through it, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's good that it's spreading
because Asia has some of the absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: most draconian drug laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's places that you land and
they're like, if we find you with this,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll just kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we just, and that it's like,
it's just on the sign, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not, they don't mess around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be good at least for some of
the lesser, lesser harmful ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially cannabis for them to take a
more normalized approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's really funny is that it's likely
that those places over there were mostly
[SPEAKER_02]: influenced.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sometimes it's not the case
because sometimes it's religion or,
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever is going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of the reason why, like the
whole war on drugs has affected cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: is it's because of us and us being
America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we basically like went around the
world and said, Hey, like if you guys are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be smoking all this dope,
dope fucking think that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can just count on us for shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, if you guys fuck around a
little worse, we're, we're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: show any mercy because you got the,
you know, like they, we've pushed those
[SPEAKER_02]: drug laws as the American government is
pushed those drug laws on the whole world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's crazy because it's a real,
it's a real weird form of insanity.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you make a war on something that is
not actually dangerous, unethical,
[SPEAKER_02]: immoral, there's really nothing wrong with
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be like, if there was a war on corn
right now, people would be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is so strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the weird thing about that too,
is that at least in America, we didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really have a cannabis tradition,
but Southeast Asia does.
[SPEAKER_01]: They literally had a long standing,
you know, tradition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can, it was part of their culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You convince one generation anywhere that
something is super immoral and dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of a sudden they're like,
Oh man, I don't want our kids doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is going to destroy our country
or, you know, the people who are
[SPEAKER_02]: incentivized by that because they want,
you know, foreign aid or because they want
[SPEAKER_02]: to just at least be in good standing
internationally in the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they basically go, Oh, well we can't,
we, we don't want to be like this country
[SPEAKER_02]: that's left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, we're still our,
everybody else has moved past this and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're still doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we need to step into the step into
the now and to the modern time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to start enforcing these laws
that these other countries are enforcing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you wind up with this weird thing,
but what's crazy about it is that when you
[SPEAKER_02]: make something up like that, it's not
like, like you can go anywhere in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, Hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not legal to steal people's shit
unless you're maybe like in California or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's loosening up a lot, but you go places
that are like, it doesn't matter where you
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: People know that certain things are
immoral, dangerous and unethical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically anywhere in the world you go,
you can't steal people's shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywhere you go in the world, you can't
kill people senselessly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywhere you go, you know, like there's
these certain things that everybody can
[SPEAKER_02]: agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these are bad things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you enforce against them,
it all makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you make a huge war that's
enforced by violence and threats of
[SPEAKER_02]: violence and, and you know, turning people
into captives and all this shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you only have it in some places,
then you cause this odd type of insanity
[SPEAKER_02]: where people leapfrog from where it's
acceptable to where it's acceptable to
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's all this weird change in the
prices and values of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause over here, now it's like still kind
of considered bad, but you can get away
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where the big price is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then where it's where it's it,
but, but it's not dangerous enough to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: people from wanting to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I mean, the thing that happened to
us, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was people, we should mention that's been
going on forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Holland got started because
permissive California and America started
[SPEAKER_01]: cracking down on the drug war and sending
helicopters and all these breeders fled to
[SPEAKER_01]: this like essentially cold gray kind of
dark place, but it was more permissive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as Switzerland opened up,
they flooded into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as Spain opened up,
they flooded into there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One point I want to say before I forget is
that one of the positives about Thailand
[SPEAKER_01]: is that their climate is so different that
it is very, very unlikely that purple
[SPEAKER_01]: candy gas is going to take over in
Thailand for a length of time,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that shit will rot there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going to need to develop
different cultivars that grow well in a
[SPEAKER_01]: hot, humid, thick climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the runs and a lot of that
kind of stuff I don't think is going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that kind of Uber dense calyxes and
buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's going to go over well
there unless you have some very expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: climate controlled situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they should, they might end up,
there might be some places as they loosen
[SPEAKER_01]: up where they become like areas where
sativas are cultivated simply because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what works in the climate that
they're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it really could be, cause I
don't see, like I don't see in Thailand,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't know if Thailand is a lot
of like it's 90 to 95 degrees and of over
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pull off more than you would
imagine there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I gave a friend of mine back in the
day, a bunch of different seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only things he couldn't grow in
Thailand was the stuff that was a monkey
[SPEAKER_02]: balls hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: He couldn't grow there that extreme
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you grow the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah, I grew candelabra.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew the lime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew, you know, he was able to pretty
much pull off everything, but not,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he wasn't a commercial grower
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the, the monkey ball stuff that
we could get away with growing here,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's still challenging for mold and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like the whole plant mold,
the whole thing just melted, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but the other stuff was like,
yeah, you know, he got a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: mold, but he was able to, he was able to
grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can get away with stuff that you
might think wouldn't, wouldn't work,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't think on a big enough level
that it would, that you'd want to have
[SPEAKER_02]: that be what you supplied over,
you know, something that was like a more
[SPEAKER_02]: narrow leaf equatorial, at least
influenced, you know, they can make
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids though, the same way we did here,
take that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will make hybrids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just mean that they'll, they'll probably
try to like, when I was even thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about like New York and stuff like that,
like they should probably be looking into
[SPEAKER_01]: like Canadian genetics for their outdoor
stuff that did well in Southern Canada and
[SPEAKER_01]: survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not necessarily bone dry California
and just trying to like take that over and
[SPEAKER_01]: switch, switch it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that kept happening too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was this famous thing, uh,
Sam talked about it a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: where most of the Afghans that got brought
over from Afghanistan and Pakistan early
[SPEAKER_01]: in like this late seventies and eighties
and stuff over here, a lot of them molded
[SPEAKER_01]: and because they came from a much more
mountainous dry climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the Afghans that like got
famous or got well known were simply the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that didn't rot and didn't breed rot
into the sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were mixing them with, you know,
so that kind of stuff matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Figuring out what suits where you're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's awesome that Thailand,
I think it's awesome that Thailand is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is, uh, is loosening up and I hope it's,
it spreads.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it could last if it's,
you know, the, the big, the big thing was
[SPEAKER_02]: that I think, you know, like you said,
we talked about it on a different episode
[SPEAKER_02]: that we did, but I was just saying like
fucking Americans, you know, like run
[SPEAKER_01]: power too, because if we made it legal,
I bet it would go legal in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: places.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there would be a lot of countries
that already get a lot of money in
[SPEAKER_01]: American tourism and they'd be perfectly
content to just sell us weed too,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we're there on vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think places like Columbia and all those
guys down there are eagerly anticipating
[SPEAKER_01]: America loosening up even further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That American money-making market drives a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how many Americans go to
Thailand?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how many Europeans go to Thailand
to party and have a good time?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they probably would be totally down to
buy weed while they're there, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: if they could do it legally and not get in
trouble or go to Thai jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd probably explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there'd be all this excess
imported, pouring in money coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd just be another tourism thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it should be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in, in, when you look at it and it's
just like, well, you know, just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gotta be handled right, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, hopefully it hope, hopefully it
can stay in because it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong at all, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look in other news, let's jump to the next
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get the banner up.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where's our picture?
[SPEAKER_00]: The California government has announced
that a special California task force has
[SPEAKER_00]: seized over 2.2 million illegal cannabis
packages, all of which they deemed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: too similar to being marketed as candy for
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they say specifically these packages
were designed to mimic popular food and
[SPEAKER_00]: candy brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the concern was raised that,
you know, it's obviously going to appeal
[SPEAKER_00]: to kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is obviously nothing new.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been aware of this for a very long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the question becomes when you can
actually see the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just over a short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seized this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe it was over a one year
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was just over like a short
targeted intensive period where they
[SPEAKER_00]: scanned the mail and the companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pulled up this many, you know,
a surprisingly large number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the question is, do we think
the trends are going to slow down?
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, you know,
we heard of people getting cease and
[SPEAKER_00]: desist for copying certain brands,
but it seems like it might be getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point where even the companies would
be too overwhelmed to really try to tackle
[SPEAKER_00]: all of it, especially when you consider
that, you know, and no shade being thrown
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our buddy Sticker Farmer, he probably has
many companies and customers who have
[SPEAKER_00]: products similar to what we're talking
about, you know, somewhat similar in
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we think it's just going to just
overwhelm the companies and we'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: people will just stop even trying to
market it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think there's a I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an interesting thing like.
[SPEAKER_02]: In.
[SPEAKER_02]: In music, like if you imagine,
imagine like people sample people's music,
[SPEAKER_02]: right, somebody takes like, oh,
I'm going to take this little piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, oh, you can't clear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see there's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There'll still be like places where it's
like Kanye took this song and he didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: clear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, he knows better.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has all the lawyers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like if somebody knows that they
have a hit, they're going to get a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: momentum off of the hit until they get
shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like imagine the difference
between having a package that is just very
[SPEAKER_02]: simple and nobody really notices it and
people don't really want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's totally honest and legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's done the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all by the book.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you don't really sell anything
versus you have a package that sells like
[SPEAKER_02]: hotcakes right now for a little while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it gets shut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of people are going to go ahead
and go with that package that they
[SPEAKER_02]: probably shouldn't really use,
but they know that it's going to hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're like, all right,
well, we'd rather get a lot of momentum
[SPEAKER_02]: for six months than have a brand that's
going to just trickle in for the next 20
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what's the point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not even going to sustain
sustain itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people will just keep going
from one thing to the next going,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, this is a hot idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a hot idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll just basically either kind of
steal things or we come a little bit or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, do something and have it be
like, oh, it's cartoony.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do that because that's not how
you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're like, yeah, but like this,
this is what's testing the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like with people, people see this,
they buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're just like, all right,
just run this up and just do it and do it
[SPEAKER_02]: and do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then be like, all right, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's as much as we could do with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're screwed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you also have a lot of people who
there's no way to know what it is anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's, you can imagine like hash
when people used to sell stamped hash
[SPEAKER_02]: bricks for a long time and they never,
they never knew who did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just knew that it was there and they
would find it and they'd be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, it's a big mystery.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know who's making whatever hash,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the case too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like the people who are known
and their faces on it and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: all right, when we get a cease and desist,
we'll stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's the people who are like,
oh, we'll never know who we are anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just keep selling this product,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, that's how, that's how I see
that kind of thing going as far as the
[SPEAKER_02]: basics of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to sound like old man yells
at cloud or anything, but I will say that
[SPEAKER_01]: with legalization, the type of artwork
and, and the colors and all that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, we're not trying to market to
children or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that, but it is very bright and it is
kind of cartoony and it is exaggerated a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll also say just totally different
that like for a long time, weed was
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially underground encounter culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we, a lot of weed names on a lot of
things were sort of takes on culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cinderella 99, you know, that's all fine
and good until all of a sudden it's legal
[SPEAKER_01]: and Disney is like, wait, we, we own
Cinderella.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some, no, no, no, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just, I don't want to,
you know, I could go over example,
[SPEAKER_01]: example, example, but we in cannabis for a
long time, a lot of cannabis things got,
[SPEAKER_01]: were sort of plays on more popular
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got away with it because we were
underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you get trademarked and as you get
legal and as you get all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: things, you start bumping into and like
Mean Gene is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the sense that people are just going to
do it and be underground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you can probably as a company,
and we've seen this a few times rise to a
[SPEAKER_01]: level that you're big enough that they
care and they shut you down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, thin mint cookies went to
cookies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a certain candy went to Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a reason for that, but you
almost have to get big enough and well
[SPEAKER_01]: known enough that your merch and
everything like that is sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: percolating up enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that big company with the copyright,
you know, or the trademark or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: like actually notices you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably do a bunch trapping
before it bubbles up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, by that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you get rid of that, like you've
already, that's like what I told the Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I told Z guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I told Tony, I was like, it was,
it was well worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like now change it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's established.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody knows everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to know what they know what it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you drop it and then you know
what it is and great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like if that's what it takes to
have something get momentum, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it that momentum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all you have to do is be like,
oh yeah, it used to be called that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've heard of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is that cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, with edibles,
it was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when everything was still medical,
I think Colorado was the first state to go
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as they went recreational,
people came into their stores and almost
[SPEAKER_01]: all the edibles got pulled off because all
the artwork was bites off Reese's or rice
[SPEAKER_01]: crispy treats, or it was really,
really, really obvious takes on other
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of food that those trademarks are
like all well established and decades old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they just came in and swept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people had to figure out like,
well, what kind of art can I use?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of name can I use that like
might skate close wherever I go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody that's my customer knows it's
kind of tongue in cheek, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: like cross the line where we're going to
be battling these $500 an hour lawyers
[SPEAKER_01]: from the Mars corporation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I think he's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just going to keep happening and
they're going to keep, there's no,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no reason to market weed to kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nobody in weed that cares about
selling to kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a terrible trope, but they
might want bright cartoony things that
[SPEAKER_01]: grab the eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that adults will purchase it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just bright, eye grabbing artwork
because most of this stuff is being sold
[SPEAKER_01]: in mylar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it's not like you're touching it
and smelling it and, and, and seeing it or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all just, it's all the mylar is
sort of like your ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, there's also in this whole
argument, there's a generation gap
[SPEAKER_02]: learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So imagine this, that there was a certain
period of time when cartoons were for
[SPEAKER_02]: kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boomers look at cartoons and they go,
those came out when we were kids,
[SPEAKER_02]: or they came out when my parents were kids
in the case of like the older cartoons,
[SPEAKER_02]: but people who are from later generations,
their parents grew up with cartoons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they never stopped watching them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not inherently related.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a boomer perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a boomer perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you see something that has
colorful characters and it's cartoony and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all this, it's like, no guys,
that's the people who are now in their
[SPEAKER_02]: fifties and their forties and their
thirties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They grew up with cartoons, but their
parents still watched cartoons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cartoons are made now for adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's been ever since the sixties,
there's been tons of cartoons that were
[SPEAKER_02]: made for adults specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is a later phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the people who are looking at it
and going, Oh, cartoons, that's for kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, there's not anything anymore at
all that says cartoons are for kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids aren't even that into cartoons
relative to what kids like Mr. Beast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kids like streamers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it'd be different if it was like,
Oh, this is the Kaisanaut packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, you know, video game packaging
that maybe would be a little more related
[SPEAKER_02]: to kids, but cartoony stuff like cereal
boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not the thing anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things are old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the things that the regulators
think kids are into, and they don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: know what kids are into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they're, they're people regulating
all this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't even have kids anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their kids are all my age now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my, my generation of Mean Gene,
we probably got up at six or seven in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning on Saturday to watch cartoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my kids don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to like wake up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can stream, you know, they don't have
to wake up at a certain time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is like wild to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, but it is, it is,
there is a whole thing of like all these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies realized, well, what do you mean
half the weed names are plays on our
[SPEAKER_01]: trademarks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that just kept happening to all
kinds of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, there's even like,
there's even weed strains named after
[SPEAKER_01]: famous actors, you know, and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, we, we, we borrow from all kinds
of culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grab whatever we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put our own twist on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always did.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one could tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone told us we were wrong anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just did whatever we wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that it's going legal,
it's like, Oh, it's your, we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: bump into this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other part of it is that I
don't really see cannabis like other
[SPEAKER_01]: drugs, but there's always been this trope
in America that drug people want to push
[SPEAKER_01]: their, their wares onto children.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like, there is no cannabis people
that could get like, that doesn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no, there was never any like,
Oh, let's hit the high school with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, this or like, let's give homie
the dime bags and middle school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was never even never on anyone's
radar ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was some like fever dream cooked up
in some far away place that they had no
[SPEAKER_01]: idea, but it exists.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dare was the, was the people who brought
all the drugs to your school.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't anybody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the only ones who showed up and
went, Hey, have you ever seen that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they showed up in a sports car and you
were like, dang, they have a nice ride.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where'd they, they got that, that dude got
a Corvette.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want a Corvette.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all glued to one board, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just balling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never seen so many.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never didn't even, I didn't even know
what these drugs were, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, and you know, it probably will
change because right now we're in the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple candy gas era of California
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would imagine candy themes,
every name, not every name.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some people out there that are
changing, but right now we're certainly in
[SPEAKER_01]: the, can I call my weed a candy or
dessert?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very heavily in that vein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, also like me and Gene
was saying with video games, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: older or ancient adults that are making
our laws associate candy with kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would an adult eat candy?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh, they probably, if you told
them that the most famous weed in
[SPEAKER_01]: California right now was stuff that was
purple candy gas, they would be baffled at
[SPEAKER_01]: what that even meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they probably might think it's
like in response to children.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generationally, you know, there was,
you know, there was, there was a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: time when there was so much of that stuff,
basically when I think it was Reagan made
[SPEAKER_02]: it legal to advertise to children.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so anybody who was an adult in that
era, the people who were adults in the
[SPEAKER_02]: eighties in the early eighties are the
people who think that all this advertising
[SPEAKER_02]: to children is advertising to children.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what they don't realize is that all
those children who were advertised to then
[SPEAKER_02]: are now 40 something, 50 years old and
they are still like that stuff all looks
[SPEAKER_02]: normal to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, if you show me something that has
like a cool cartoon character on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Oh, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can put like Skeletor on some
shit and I'm like, Oh, that sounds dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your shit's called Skeletor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and that's probably hardcore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds cool to me, but like they
would go, Oh, well that's for kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, no kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not kids don't know Skeletor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just cause it was a cartoon from
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like that is what's hip with the
young kids now, you know, but then people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know it.
They don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't realize that like kids today
probably don't care about Skeletor,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's all these cartoons that
classify, they qualify as nostalgia for
[SPEAKER_01]: people like our age.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A 10 year old doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what is, what do you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you can see behind me,
I, you can see what my art is for my
[SPEAKER_02]: brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no weed in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has nothing to do with weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a seed brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a apparel brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made it that way because I like to
have it be something like, Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: my kid can wear the shirt to school.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know what it is, you know what it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's very, very much a weed
thing, but it isn't, it isn't like
[SPEAKER_02]: cartoony.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was how I wanted my thing to look.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I see something that's super,
super cartoony, like it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, it's a weird definition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go, so what is a cartoon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a cartoon?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hand drawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not photo realistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's stylized.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has bright colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a cartoon?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a while, they said that you couldn't
have any animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, so my hummingbird is this,
this is, is this what kids want to,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is what kids are into is this
hummingbird up here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it was more cartoony, does that,
is that inherently appeal the chat to the
[SPEAKER_02]: child mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I just don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like the whole, the whole thing
is trippy, you know, like, is this a
[SPEAKER_02]: cartoon?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hand drawn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like look at old cartoons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at like Snow White.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost photo realistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases, there's only a little bit
of caricature added to certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The backgrounds are totally realistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the whole, the whole thing is really
strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: The definitions and the more, the more
they tried to define it, the more they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to wind up going, oh shit,
we just need to put serial numbers on
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at that point you're like,
yeah, everything out of the product in the
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the whole thing's goofy as shit
myself, but that's just my take on it.
You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, it seems like there's sort of
endless degrees of which you can try to
[SPEAKER_00]: nitpick at it, which I completely
understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things not so dog said that I
think is a great segue is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the fact we're in the purple
candy gas era, of course lends itself to
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that you're going to see this
sort of marketing, but as it so happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the major movers and shakers,
Mr. Dozier himself has come out swinging
[SPEAKER_00]: saying the age of candy is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says biscotti, soap, gelinate,
permanent marker is, is what people are
[SPEAKER_00]: requesting at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says that candy is not on the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys think?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a vague definition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I consider all those things to be,
to be candy, you know, to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't say, I don't think that
they're like exclusively gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they are nice and gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: They smell good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They smell acrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything to me smells like the very best
of, of like the really, really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanis from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like not so knows like the thing that they
called FX up here is very close to what
[SPEAKER_02]: now everybody calls the candy gas or the
purple gas of now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And meaning like past the candy where it's
the gassier side, that kind of like acrid
[SPEAKER_02]: with that interesting edge of soapiness
and the kind of like this deep kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: musky.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's these certain profile that you
know, if you know it from way back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, and it was like things that pop out
of certain purple Afghanis, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the most special of the deep chunk,
the monkey balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really the rare ones in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This thing I had called big blue,
some of the stuff that would pop out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even now when I did all the Hindu ass
ones, there's these things that pop out
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm like, Oh, they smell like really
like they're kind of in that ballpark,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's still so similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: All that weed is so similar to just like
cookies gelato weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not that different to say that
all of a sudden now everything is totally
[SPEAKER_02]: flipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new paradigm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, it is just more of the same
fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's literally all the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It made me knew it's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good versions, but like I'm
literally pulling out of these ones that I
[SPEAKER_02]: just cut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smelling them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, there's that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is Jaro sensis.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sensi star cross sensi star cross
Jaro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I crossed it with Hindu.
[SPEAKER_02]: This smells really similar to those things
like permanent marker or the other things
[SPEAKER_02]: with the musk, the soap, the little bit of
that Afghani cookies underlying thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: like, if you know that kind of weed,
you know that kind of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, I'm just like, it's just,
we've been stuck there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been stuck there since fucking
animal cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, it's all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now if you haven't seen that original
type by itself, then you can't see that
[SPEAKER_02]: everything is a quarter that, but if you
know that type, you see that it's just all
[SPEAKER_02]: modulating this one type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like this swirling thing of
them dancing around this fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all the same weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I honestly, for myself, have no
problem with it because that weed from
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the day, that type was always kind
of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really hard to lock down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really fucking liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all my buddy had something that was,
I can't remember what it was, but it was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, it was something he made.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like jokers crossed with,
I want to say, like cookies and cream or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he handed me a button.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went, that's that shit that came out of
that weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had that first garden in the nineties
that with that coffee smell that almost
[SPEAKER_02]: smells a little bit like Sharpie markers,
like kind of opium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm smelling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going, I fucking love this type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's just more fucking cookies weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to say that like, it's all flipped on
its head now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, yeah, maybe now skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people want things that are like a
variation of the Scotty or they want like
[SPEAKER_02]: this variation, like all those things to
me, when I smell them all, I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like, that's, it's not like it's that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like it's that different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like you smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like you smell Jack and then you
smelled Skittles or you smelled OG and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you smelled purple Urkel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, no, it's, it's all really close
together to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in a tight target of what like you're
breeding in my opinion, but everybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, and it's not to say that it's
really the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that it's all a quarter
the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everything is different around it
on this frame of this old Afghani smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a quick thought and a long thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: My quick thought, cause you made me stare
at that picture for a long time is I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a diamond watch that makes me look
cool when I want to smoke joints and have
[SPEAKER_01]: people take pictures of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems very important to have
diamond watches.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very important to have a nice down in
SoCal and be part of the weed scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's a lot of, uh, nice watch going
on status symbols and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, I mean, dude, I think that,
you know, the reality of it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that cookies became some of the most
popular weed and it became popular at a
[SPEAKER_01]: time when people started reversing cuts,
specific cuts onto other cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just went through like what he
was saying at length about everything kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of being the same, same as we have this
running joke that like a lot of times when
[SPEAKER_01]: people are like, Oh, look at this new,
new, and it's same, same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, there's only so many variations
of like cookie gelato, OG hybrids,
[SPEAKER_01]: all using the same eight to 10 cuts in
different combinations, blending
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves together.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be really nice weed that comes
out of that somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, but because weed boomed and
changed around then it's going to take
[SPEAKER_01]: real effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I would imagine Doge is going to be
like, Oh, the area age of candy is over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's like eight new kind of candy
strains that are different, but the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's almost like feeding people more
of the same genre of music, but trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: say it's groundbreaking, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many breeders and there's so
many people who start was using things
[SPEAKER_01]: that were heavily made out of the same few
cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take some time to branch out
because a lot of people, those are the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones they had access to when they started
working, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just flooded with all this
same stuff, you know, and it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, uh, there's thin mint,
but then, you know, Sherbert is thin mint,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and then gelato is Sherbert,
buy thin mint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, and you start adding
various four or five different OG cuts and
[SPEAKER_01]: you start adding these different purples
and stuff and they get a million names.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you scale it all back, the genetics
really aren't that wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has become like sort of the bulk
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of cool people that have
access to like heirlooms or stuff that are
[SPEAKER_01]: completely outside that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're like creeks, you know,
we're not the main river.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not the main tributary.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like an offshoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main tributary is this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if dudes like that's over,
it would be a scramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know what the next big thing
is because the market has changed so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not the way that everything became
a big thing is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like almost every, almost every
famous elite started in some small group.
[SPEAKER_01]: People liked the smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got, it sold for a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: More people wanted it because of the
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brokers start asking for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how the first wave of purple or
that's how the Hindu or that's how the
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Lights or that's how the white
family or that's how the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the sour or the cookie or Skittles worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we have modern marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, where is the next wave of
weed going to bubble up from?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's a lot of, same,
same right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for things to really be different,
it's going to have to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to literally honestly have to
be somebody like, I, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can, I mean, we can mention a bunch of
names, but it's going to have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody like different that comes out
with something different that just breaks
[SPEAKER_01]: through and becomes popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then honestly, what's going to happen
is that thing is going to get a million
[SPEAKER_01]: variations with names attached.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if mean gene came out and his yarrow
by whatever, by whatever became the name
[SPEAKER_01]: of the next big thing, people would take
it and reverse it and copy it and buy
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds of it and cross it to different
things and make their own versions of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that would dominate for a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know where it's going to go
because the whole method of things getting
[SPEAKER_01]: popular has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's like, you have influencers like
Doja or like burner, like whoever that are
[SPEAKER_01]: telling us what the next heat is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably something they have a
line on making money off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it doesn't work in six months,
they'll have the next heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd has been this weird thing where
consumers told farmers and brokers what
[SPEAKER_01]: they wanted and they sort of demanded it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody, nobody would have chosen to grow
Kush, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got to figure out how to like
make these rinky dinky little like dink,
[SPEAKER_01]: dink, dink, dink, dink, dink chunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you'd want to grow like some
kind of big stretchy Afghan sativa thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: a blue dream, something that, you know,
something that gets huge, like in Mean
[SPEAKER_01]: Genes era of 500 gallon pots and 12
footers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like nobody would choose cookie
from a production standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't like food, doesn't like light,
doesn't like to get very tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But consumers used to demand certain
things and then farmers and brokers rushed
[SPEAKER_01]: in to fill that demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure that same dynamic exists
anymore because of the changes and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know what dynamic is necessarily going to
replace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but it might just be that Doja's
is like his customer base.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just bored of it like music.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're just bored of the genre
and they want something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they've been smoking the same
variations of the same thing 45 times over
[SPEAKER_01]: for the last eight years and they're over
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It happened already.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already saw it when it was original.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was originally the purple craze of the
sweet weed and that was all anyone would
[SPEAKER_02]: touch and it was Urkel and everybody
wanted that and granddaddy and anything
[SPEAKER_02]: that was really close to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it flipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about it all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it flipped to Kush and then all the
stuff that's now out is kind of like all
[SPEAKER_02]: Urkel Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the second purple wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's deja vu.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's like, if you take,
to me, if you take Urkel, OG and like Baba
[SPEAKER_02]: or Hindu and you mix that together,
you're going to keep spitting out all
[SPEAKER_02]: these things that everybody keeps going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is the new new.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you could get like a Urkel and an OG
combo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's tweaked just the right way,
you could have something like Skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just has to have a lot of the most
special part of the Urkel with a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of the OG part that isn't the accurate
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll wind up with this crazy soapy
fruity thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need this 10% of this and 10% of
that and get rid of all the rest of all
[SPEAKER_02]: that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can wind up with this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like this, but it's just a trip to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's funny with like, as far as like,
what's the next big thing for my nose,
[SPEAKER_02]: like even though that's cause I'm really
interested in plants and I'm really
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in variety and preservation and
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as for products, I don't even
think that it's a weird thing that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: arrived where we've arrived.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you took me when I was 16 and
you asked me what everything, what
[SPEAKER_02]: everything should be, that's the very
biggest thing on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have said what it is right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that was the weed that I liked then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was when people used to ask me,
what's the best thing you've ever seen?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Oh, it's this crazy frosty
purple shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it smelled like super like crazy and
deep and dark and chemically and bomb
[SPEAKER_02]: fruity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, there's these crazy old kinds of
weed that are really bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, like, yeah, they're not
like, they're not like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like your Mendo P, but at the same time,
they share a lot of the appeal that those
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of plants have where you're like,
Oh, if you liked Urkel, you, you might
[SPEAKER_02]: think if you liked Urkel and you really
liked Hindu, then you probably wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: hate permanent marker because these things
are all kind of like this kind of like a
[SPEAKER_02]: modern take on old Afghani weed with a
little bit of something exotic thrown in
[SPEAKER_02]: from a rare plant that you wouldn't
normally find in the field of accurate
[SPEAKER_02]: weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where it's like, kind of like
this magic combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one of the reason why
it gets stuck like that is because for a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people, if they're really into
something like these newest of the crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are out right now,
whatever they are, if you do give them a
[SPEAKER_02]: bag of blue dream and you give them a bag
of permanent marker, they're going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: back to the bag of the permanent marker
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the blue dream's not going to be the
thing they want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to convert it even if
they're not influenced.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just going to be like,
I don't know, this one just has this thing
[SPEAKER_02]: to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's thick, it's rich, it smokes good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, most people smoke so much
weed, they're not going to notice that the
[SPEAKER_02]: high is kind of lackluster because every
fucking high they've had in the last 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years is lackluster anyway, because that
actually makes me hopeful because dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: I coming from the Midwest, I grew up on
Mexican, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember when I first got my a sack
of much better than Mexican weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, Oh my God, weed can be
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are people out there that
grew up on purple candy gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not trying to diss it all hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I think most heads would agree,
there are some exceptions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, it's kind of got
like a medium mid grade kind of flat high
[SPEAKER_01]: that you get a tolerance to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it might look beautiful, taste great,
smoke well or whatever, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually have some of the more unique
highs that other strains do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those young people one day,
they might smoke a haze or they might
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke something weird and not even realize
weed can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they've been tough puffing on this
like, this like one offshoot, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say, too, that one of the
things that that I don't know if it's true
[SPEAKER_01]: or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one of the reasons why people
loved crossing things to cookie was not
[SPEAKER_01]: only was it so famous, but like cookie was
sort of the was sort of like where things
[SPEAKER_01]: shifted from a lot of kind of ugly weed
that was still really nice sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookie made everything has to look
visually amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really did up how most things
looked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're on IG, you're on this,
you can't smell it, you can't smoke it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't squeeze it, but you can look at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're very visual creatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do kind of wonder it not because
the funny part about weed is that looks
[SPEAKER_01]: really doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't like looks doesn't make it
taste good or work well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't tell how what it looks like in a
joint, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really matters as far as sales
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how easy it would be for
a phenomenal strain that's a little uglier
[SPEAKER_01]: to catch on in today's market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might take a sort of a maturing of the
scene for a while, because everyone's used
[SPEAKER_01]: to weed looking fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you straight up, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the sour craze really first hit in
Mendo, most brokers and mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: back me up on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times they would come over and
they would open the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the nose hit them the right way,
they would just be like, yes, they knew
[SPEAKER_01]: that if it smelled like that, it was going
to work for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd still look through it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was this nose and it's like if
they opened it up and they got hit with it
[SPEAKER_01]: and they knew it was fresh and it was
good, that nose was going to be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, we're this is going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were always involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't even care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a lot of times where like
sour could look kind of stemmy,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, you know, like it wasn't it,
you know, it wasn't always the prettiest
[SPEAKER_01]: looking sack.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew it was potent and it smelled
amazing and that was going to work for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to work for the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they cared about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, people are so indoctrinated
into weed looking extremely visually
[SPEAKER_01]: attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if that's like a permanent shift
where you're just going to have to breed
[SPEAKER_01]: weed that looks attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I wonder if there's going to be
openness to like this weed looks kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: ugly, but, man, it's lip smacking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and like the weed, like my
favorite weed, like back in the day,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of it that I'm talking about was
because of how it smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tasted so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked so much weed that if it tasted
really good and it burnt right,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like that was enough because it was
like, you know, the high we weren't that
[SPEAKER_02]: worried about it because we knew we were
going to get high because we sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, much fucking weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but yeah, a lot of the highs are more
lackluster.
[SPEAKER_02]: But more, I mean, like it was the weed
that I looked at and was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is what 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a time machine, you're like,
oh, man, people would buy this shit so
[SPEAKER_02]: fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a lot of people buying weed,
it's never going to come down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: character of the high or any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: For a lot of people, it's always just
going to be they look at it real quick and
[SPEAKER_02]: they go, oh, shit, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are going to continue to
choose friends like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many people do you know who the
friends who they will choose are the
[SPEAKER_02]: people who they know have the most money
or the most access to a certain crowd or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't care about people's
character at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They continue to just hang out with people
who have the most shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, oh, those people are
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they can get me into this party.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do a lot of shit for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of people, that's like,
unfortunately, that's a crowd mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with weed, there's always going to be
this thing where people look at it real
[SPEAKER_02]: quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go, oh, fuck, yeah, this is cool
fucking weed, you know, and then that's
[SPEAKER_02]: just as far as it's ever going to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas like me or you will sit down and
we'll go, yeah, oh, wow, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it is full of stem and it is got tiny
little flowers and I can't really see the
[SPEAKER_02]: resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you like roll it up and you're
like, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That made like my nose is stuck with a
smell for fucking hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a me tasting and that's for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that sense, dude, is that like,
if you could take a sack of, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, animal cookies or permanent
marker or something that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: attractive and you could like throw that
into a jar and time travel back to 19 year
[SPEAKER_01]: old you and show that to you in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was so much prettier looking than
most of the weed you had access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would imagine it had to be as good as
it looked.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would just be blown away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in some of the weed back then,
what's crazy is some of the weed back
[SPEAKER_02]: then, it just kind of looked the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have this shit called Big Blue and
it's still to this day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I'll show you too, like when I,
after I revenge and regrow these Hindu S
[SPEAKER_02]: ones properly, you'll be like,
there's cookies, there's gelato,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's all the stuff that everybody
thinks are these modern looks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, no, it was all in the old
gene pool from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of it popped out from these
ancestral things that you and me had from
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the effects, it had more bag appeal
than cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like you rolled it in sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Northern Lights my mom had,
you're like that was, cookies doesn't even
[SPEAKER_02]: look like it has any resin compared to
that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was wild stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's just, I don't know,
it's a crazy thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that in a lot of cases when
marketing happens, you know, you're
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing, I don't want to say it,
but you're kind of marketing to shallow
[SPEAKER_02]: people, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's kind of like you're marketing to
shallow people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking hate to say it, but like,
you know, who wears the fucking,
[SPEAKER_02]: who wears the fucking, you know,
I don't want to like make anybody feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like stupid, but like some of these name
brand things that cost a lot of fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: money and they have the brand written all
over them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to like blow anybody's trip,
but the rich people don't wear that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They buy the one where you can't see the
brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's subtlety.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nuance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're buying it because of the way the
shit's sewn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're buying it because of the material
it's made out of.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're buying it because it's got some
reference to this, or it's in this color
[SPEAKER_02]: that means something to a certain people,
a group of people that you don't fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's not really rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing, one thing I should say too is
because things are so controlled now and
[SPEAKER_01]: this is basically about like what,
what would come after purple candy gas or
[SPEAKER_01]: the age of candy is over is that like
what's in stores is what people are
[SPEAKER_01]: growing is what the nurseries make
available as clones or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that there aren't some farms that have
their own stuff, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not that easy for like an organic
shift to just happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like, like layers now,
like most farms, buy their plants from a
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery, which means that nursery has to
choose to mom up those plants to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: clones off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to try to pick what they
think is the most popular thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to sell a lot of clones of
for that era that they're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: offering it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they switch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like six to 12 things they offer
like three, four times a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they probably got a bunch of
moms, they're ramping up and a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: moms, they're ramping down and then moms
that are in their prime and they switch it
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit, you know, but it's not going
to be like, I'm, I think that the way that
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd used to get popular has broken down
and there's going to be some kind of new
[SPEAKER_01]: paradigm and people are going to need to
sell what the work is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the work, I think part of the reason
why purple candy gas has lasted so long is
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what the brokers and that's what
the hustlers and that's what everyone has
[SPEAKER_01]: to make hash with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's there in large amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like an order for the market to
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to get some amount
of, of new herb that people want that's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting made into flower and hash and
joints and edibles and this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a slower process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'll give like, like, maybe I'll say
this and I'm sorry for ranting on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like going to your local grocery
store, they usually only have two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of whatever veggie it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a few kinds of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got, you know, they got the dark red
beats and maybe they got some golden ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a Q cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got two kinds of cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got like, you know, like as weed
becomes more legal producers and stuff are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to want to just settle on production
classics that work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it could kind of get trapped in
time for a bit of like, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: convince producers to grow something
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well, I've already got
all my nutrition dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already know how much EC to give.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when to flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when to this, I've got it dialed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting 3.4 pounds a light with my led
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to mess with some new,
new, why switch?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you could have a situation where
we'd sort of calcifies a bit in the center
[SPEAKER_01]: because the people growing it and selling
it and hyping it like don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't even know what to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even know what to change to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's been kind of the
standard, like forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, at a certain point it was
like, if you were growing, if you were
[SPEAKER_02]: growing, you know, weed in Jamaica,
you were growing this Indian variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were growing weed in Columbia,
I assume it was whatever that first import
[SPEAKER_02]: was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it came over and they all had one
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: At one point, if somebody was growing
weed, it was probably skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at one point it was probably
Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at one point in some places,
it was probably like sweet tooth or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, like Cindy or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think it basically we're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're constantly in these little waves
where everything is all the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only reason why there was a little
more variety was because everyone was
[SPEAKER_02]: isolated and that isolation was protecting
cultures.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, isolation protects cultures to
an extent and it evolves cultures to an
[SPEAKER_02]: extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as you've got the Internet,
it's like it's going to get rid of some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that naturally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, there's always the
small amount of people who are more into
[SPEAKER_02]: all the really weird shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like right now, more than at
any point in history, there's probably
[SPEAKER_02]: more people who are into weird shit than
there ever was because they're able to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at all of history and go,
oh, what was the weird shit that you had
[SPEAKER_02]: back then over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone's like, I got the weird shit
from back then over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can get it and try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas back in the day, if I wanted to
try the weird shit from back then over
[SPEAKER_02]: there, that was completely inaccessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I could get was the normal shit from
here right now or it from there right now
[SPEAKER_02]: or the normal shit from over there back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: But none of the like the weird little it's
trippy, you know, like I feel like right
[SPEAKER_02]: now is really, really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think that you're ever going
to see a time when it completely comes
[SPEAKER_02]: undone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't think like classical music
is going to make a huge fucking comeback.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there's probably more people
listening to it right now than there has
[SPEAKER_02]: been a lot in the past because of the
Internet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think access is going to make all
of a sudden, hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking the number one album once again is
like when it was fucking Miles Davis or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a lot of people who know what
that is and they're into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't think it's ever coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to bring back classical
hip hop's going to have to sample it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to bring back jazz,
hip hop's got to sample it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to like make like Hayes
popular, you might have to toss some color
[SPEAKER_02]: on it or you might have to make it pretty
to make something that's a huge thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: starts a huge wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, you're still going to
have the people who are listening to jazz
[SPEAKER_02]: and listening to classical and there's
still more of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that you're so overwhelmed by
all the basic shit that it's like you're
[SPEAKER_02]: like, dude, it's a flip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't I don't know that it ever
will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I this might be an aside or whatever,
but I should tell a funny story like a 20,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 plus years ago, maybe 22 years ago,
I used to go to these harvest festivals,
[SPEAKER_01]: these little private parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually the first place that I
met CSI or Shaw like 707, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: or like Chip from Royal Gold, you know,
or whatever, like that does the real dirt,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a bunch of people, a bunch of people
from like Overgrow and Cannabis World and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember getting invited to this
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like a who's who of underground
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like in my early 20s or whatever mid
20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'm going to meet all the old
schoolers that have all the real shit that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hunting for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went there and it was like
everything popular at the time that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was across the white widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was across the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was across the sweet tooth and
Blockhead and Louie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, Breeder Steve was big and
like DJ Short and like the first Brothers
[SPEAKER_01]: Grimm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think in a way that's always sort
of happened is like people take popular
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that other people are into and start
crossing it into everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems overwhelming at the time,
you know, you know, for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I think the the purple gas
stuff has sort of been locked in a time
capsule.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a second, because it's just been there
as all the changes have been happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's a lot of weed
that's not that that I would imagine will
[SPEAKER_01]: become popular simply because it's like
you get to reintroduce old hits to new
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that weed is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't know how long it'll take
for like diversity to develop in these
[SPEAKER_01]: various markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as as markets develop like and get
more mature, there's people that are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to want to try the famous strains of old
or different takes on this or that weed
[SPEAKER_01]: nerds, you know, that want something just
off the beaten path a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those things will get their
fandom.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know how quick it's going to
occur because the market is pretty,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I don't want to say it's
collapsing under its own weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's it's pretty unbalanced at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's not a lot of freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of freedom of
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's way more people just trying to
hold on than feeling like frisky and
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to experiment with what the market
may or may not be interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm curious, heavy in where you're
at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a thing that has happened where
it's completely leaned towards one kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: grouping or has interesting variation and
kind of more old school things have they
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of kept kept the ground and
maintained like a big space in the market
[SPEAKER_02]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the old school unique sort
of plants are certainly dying like they
[SPEAKER_00]: only really exist in the outdoor
landscape, not not in the indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the indoor space is all dominated by
younger generations plugged into
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, running all the latest RS 11
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally speaking, the culture mimics
the USA culture with like a certain time
[SPEAKER_00]: delay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things that are popular there may be
popular here like a year later or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: like once it becomes available as like an
S1 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of the old school stuff,
there are these outdoor guys who do big
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers with the, you know, like Old
Mother Sativa or Air Luma climatized tie
[SPEAKER_00]: type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still do that because,
you know, you can't deny the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it performed, but it's
dwindling.
[SPEAKER_01]: If Old Mother Sativa exists over there
still, that would be lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an old friend who's passed on now
from Mendo that had some of that and he
[SPEAKER_01]: had the biggest plants I have ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just like top to bottom giant
colas all over itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had it was obviously heavily Sativa,
but it had enough indica in it that it
[SPEAKER_01]: threw it like literally was like a 12 foot
round ball that threw bats all over
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so I might even have a picture of
it I could send you if I look deep enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just said it was Old Mother Sativa
and he said it was from Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that stuff exists, that would be
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even remember how big it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just remember how giant, how
unbelievably giant it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's nice sort of moderately
uplifting Sativa sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've yet to have stuff that's like
profoundly psychedelic in the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: like maybe some of the ties that you see
with Coastal or Bodhi, like they can
[SPEAKER_00]: really tap into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and also Old Mother Sativa is a term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a broad term, you know,
like it's just like it's more or less just
[SPEAKER_00]: a term for saying like this is like some
sort of a climatized heirloom tie that's
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly been grown outdoors for who knows
how many generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it is still around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably, you know, in reality,
it's probably getting harder to find
[SPEAKER_00]: because the people who used to buy that
sort of stuff usually bought it because
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't know where to get better stuff
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they could get was this sort of
outdoorsy stuff that was generally
[SPEAKER_00]: considered second rate compared to Indica
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when medicalization rolled in,
those were all the first people who got
[SPEAKER_00]: their cards because they had the most to
gain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like in terms of the quality jump,
they had the most to gain by getting on,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it's, you know, the stuff we
laugh at, the Canadian radiated imported
[SPEAKER_00]: herb that's not considered that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was still significantly better in their
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've actually heard from a few of what
I've seen it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of grow stores in Australia
that are shutting down because a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the guys who used to grow stuff outdoors
that was a bit more bulk, a bit less
[SPEAKER_00]: quality, maybe using some of these old
acclimatized strains that really did
[SPEAKER_00]: produce volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just the market has evaporated for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the medical market has just swallowed
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was saying before, Morocco is
mostly like super lemon haze and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and critical mass and,
you know, big, you know, them bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: over kilos of that kind of seed and having
them grow whole fields of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the farmers are happy because they're
going to buy it all and hash it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the stains right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they grow what's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stains right there give us the
stuff that we, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: here's the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll make, take a whole room.
[SPEAKER_02]: They make tons of seeds and they give it
to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they hash back, you know,
I actually have thought, and this might be
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of controversial or weird,
but like the fact that like America went
[SPEAKER_01]: to war with Afghanistan and Afghanistan
for 20 years might've done more to protect
[SPEAKER_01]: like Afghanistan, Afghanistan's like
traditional Indicas from being flooded
[SPEAKER_01]: with anything because it just wasn't safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people to like go there and travel
around very much, unless you were in the
[SPEAKER_01]: military.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was a bunch of resentment
and you didn't want to get your head cut
[SPEAKER_01]: off or be in some kind of Taliban video,
but like, you know, Arjun and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: they weren't doing any like, any like,
you know, uh, safaris or whatever into
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Hindu Kush mountains to like meet
people for strain hunters because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: too dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of kept those farmers isolated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they were exporting things,
but not really importing, if that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't being influenced by the
larger globes change in Kana over the last
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years, because it was a war zone and it
was dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it was, you know, I mean,
that could change in the future,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I almost think that like the Taliban
combination of like the war and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Taliban is probably like isolated them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Taliban's a huge problem because
they're really good at eradicating
[SPEAKER_02]: everything over there right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's pushed things into the real
extremes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mountains and the higher up Pakistani
border wilderness regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's cool because like, I was told for
years and years, like, yeah, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: nowhere in the world where they still have
the old things they had.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all been watered down and all this
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, when I finally taught,
started talking to people on the internet
[SPEAKER_02]: who were like up there in those mountains,
I was like, yeah, what's the weed smell
[SPEAKER_02]: like?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's it look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, oh, it's, you know,
it's like, there's ones they smell like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like earthy kind of acrid coffee,
dead meat, weird kind of stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and like describing them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, that sounds like all the
really old Afghani that I was considered
[SPEAKER_02]: to be like, what's the definition of the
Afghani stuff that I knew that I knew had
[SPEAKER_02]: been kept pure here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you start to see the pictures and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, oh, this is, and then you
see the areas and you see the people and
[SPEAKER_02]: you see like a market place with all the
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you go, this is not a place where
there's just a whole bunch of outsiders
[SPEAKER_02]: polluting everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's, they're not going to try to,
and then you see the way they grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a big thing that I picked up in
Jamaica was that when they took all the
[SPEAKER_02]: things to grow in my buddy's neighborhood
in Jamaica, they planted them and they all
[SPEAKER_02]: died because they rely on the rainfall and
the cycles of the seasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the weed ain't from there and it
hasn't been there, or it's not from a
[SPEAKER_02]: similar climate, it just all fucking dies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't really take this Amsterdam
hybrid shit and throw it out by the
[SPEAKER_02]: handful in Afghanistan and leave it in the
desert with two rains a year and expect it
[SPEAKER_02]: to survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It needs to have big fat fan leaves and
thick stems to draw water from when it
[SPEAKER_02]: dries out and all this different shit,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you realize when you look at the
fields, you're like, they look pretty,
[SPEAKER_02]: they look pretty similar to when you look
at the old picture of like Schultz or
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever over there and like plants of the
gods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see those little Afghanis are
like, looks like monkey balls,
[SPEAKER_02]: looks like big blue, looks like the same
shit that they have now when you see like
[SPEAKER_02]: Deepak going over there and bringing back,
you know, like this big, this book back
[SPEAKER_02]: here, it's Afghan project.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it kind of looks the same as
it's ever looked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was super excited because- It might
be one of the only places left that's like
[SPEAKER_01]: that because- One of the few- Jamaica,
Morocco, Mexico, Colombia, Thailand,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they don't have, they didn't go
through the same things that isolated them
[SPEAKER_01]: like that region did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't have what they used to have
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different reasons for different countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like a lot of that legendary herb is
either lost or reduced to such a point,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we'd have to like refine it again,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But Afghanistan and Pakistan and those
regions, they're just so dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they stayed isolated to locals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not as influenced, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty easy to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, I'm not just going to go
walking in there and go back like a big
[SPEAKER_02]: shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like- No, there's not,
there's not critical mass or super silver
[SPEAKER_01]: haze in the Hindu Kush right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't look like it.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might have, we might not have access
to it, but like they, they, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess there's some people on the
internet making access happen,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like- I mean, there's people out
there, there's people in Pakistan who are
[SPEAKER_02]: growing ruts, you know, it is a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're growing it like indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not field farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, in the fields, they have to continue
to grow what works in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really want to risk,
you know, your field on some, whatever it
[SPEAKER_02]: is, you know, there's no reason to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you already have the thing that you
know is going to make a whole lot of- It's
[SPEAKER_01]: acclimated.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the variety there just comes from
like, you know, acclimated might be like
[SPEAKER_01]: acclimated to this valley, this mountain
pass, this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like those people travel a
ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're probably just working
essentially like, you know, me and Gene
[SPEAKER_01]: and I joke that like, and, but this is
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like there'd be Hills and Mendo and
neighborhoods that would all have very
[SPEAKER_01]: similar weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you drove 30 minutes to a different
neighborhood, maybe there was a different
[SPEAKER_01]: collector on that road and the neighbors
would get seeds from him and it would have
[SPEAKER_01]: a little different kick to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a little different mix of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even when I first moved here,
like weed was very regional based on road
[SPEAKER_01]: and where you were in the County and all
that, it was still, and I think it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: that in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very regional.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very like, you could go drive
for 20 minutes in a different Valley and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, I think we could probably muse
on it forever, but given how long we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been going for, why don't we jump into
the, uh, a little final segment before we
[SPEAKER_00]: wrap up the heaviest thought of this week?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've taken some musings from a seven,
10 labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put a post up recently where they
sort of posed a rhetorical question saying
[SPEAKER_00]: our hash holes overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got me thinking, you know, like,
I mean, first of all, the obvious
[SPEAKER_00]: interpretation is, you know, like,
is it better just to enjoy your flower and
[SPEAKER_00]: your hash sort of separate on their own,
but I guess, you know, we exist in this
[SPEAKER_00]: culture where hash holes are starting to
become a more standard phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Among those who consume doinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see those even ever increasing in
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it starts to beg the question,
you know, are we, are we just starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a bit too hedonistic about all of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a bit indulgent for the sake of
indulgence?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it better to consume them separately?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess as a little side note,
you can also make the argument that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of easier for sub quality material to
fly under the radar when you blend flower
[SPEAKER_00]: with concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's almost a secondary sort of
conundrum there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd love to hear your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hash holes overkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll say I'm pretty confident that
you're talking to two primarily flower
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking humans who dabble a bit in hash,
but it's not your primary gig.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that I think that hash has
become as things have loosened up,
[SPEAKER_01]: hash has become massive compared to like
sort of a small corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of weed for at least Americans in the
past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's raised a bunch of people's
tolerances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of weed smokers who
basically they don't consume flower all
[SPEAKER_01]: that often.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash is like what they're used to smoking,
whether they're dabbing it, whether
[SPEAKER_01]: they're mixing it or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think fads are going to happen
because you have all this excess hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that over the last 10 or
15 years as hash has become really
[SPEAKER_01]: popular, I think there's been an immense
amount of fads that have lasted a year or
[SPEAKER_01]: two and change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do you remember back in like 09 or
2010 when everybody took dabs off a cherry
[SPEAKER_01]: glowing like thousand degree banger,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was just common before we
realized it was carcinogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the styles of hash have changed
and like what kind of color and what kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do feel you're probably right in
that local lower quality weed and lower
[SPEAKER_01]: quality hash will blend together to make
like a product that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Europe, I would say when I first
started going over there, they always
[SPEAKER_01]: looked at me as nuts as smoking pure weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All their weed always had hash in it,
or they would smoke the hash with tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: even more commonly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think mixing in joints or various
things, you can call it different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think mixing hash and weed or mixing
hash and tobacco is like a practice that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been around for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certain cultures, it's like the norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, definitely as long ago as 25 years
ago, we were putting snakes of hash in the
[SPEAKER_02]: middle of joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't really see anything wrong
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally don't want to do it because a
big part of smoking joints is like for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: I really am like trying to like I'm trying
to learn about the weed because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: like my more of my job is to know about
the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So putting hash in it's like not going to
really give me any very clear idea of what
[SPEAKER_02]: the hell's going on with the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I over the years have like become less and
less excited about any type of mixing of
[SPEAKER_02]: anything with weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did smoke weed with tobacco,
which is hilarious because that's like the
[SPEAKER_02]: most extreme mixing you could possibly
get.
[SPEAKER_02]: But tobacco is so harsh and gnarly that if
weed can cut through it and be still
[SPEAKER_02]: really killer, killer weed, it says a lot
about the weed and any weed that is like
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of half ass that might trick you in a
regular joint, you go, oh, that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mix it with tobacco and it will just
be like, yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you take like the very best,
like if you take anything that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: tasty, like lemon tree or Jaro or OG Kush
or diesel or whatever, you mix it with
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco, you'll still be like,
damn, you can really taste the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you can taste the weed more
clearly, the character of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's set against this juxtaposition
of something really gross along with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really makes it pop out,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as like putting hash in weed,
I've just never like, I'll put,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take like hash bomb hits and put hash
on top of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really only the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weed's only there to keep that make
the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a carrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a something for it to light on and
melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And burn into as you take a bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically for me, anytime you mix one
thing with the other thing, one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things is I'm going to look at it as an
adulterate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people are like, oh, moon rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You take the weed and you dip it in the
oil and then you roll it in the Keith.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are like, dude, if you do that
with like the very best craziest oil ever,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you do with the very best
craziest full all head sift.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like all super crazy products.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you put them together, then they're
like, then that that that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, then that is every,
every, every other thing is just in the
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everything is an adulterate to the
other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't look at it like,
oh, that's a great fucking idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always look at it like, no, I want to,
I want to see what the hash is like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see what the weed is like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't, I don't get much about each
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if I know them really well,
after a while, I might go, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, let's mix this together and see
what that does.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, I want to see what
things are by themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that to me is like, um, that's the
best way to do them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and I'm funny like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I drink alcohol, I don't want you to
put the alcohol in the fucking juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a cup of juice and give me a
fucking cup of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll drink the fucking whatever it is
by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll sit and I'll drink a cup of
juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't want the alcohol in the
juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want the juice in the alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like let me drink the alcohol and see what
that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then let me drink the juice and see
what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you put them together,
you ruin both.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I feel about those kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even sometimes when I'm sitting in the
kitchen making tacos, I'll just sit there
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll like eat the meat and then be
wine and end up just being like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the meat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really need the taco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like the meat was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, the meat's already so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a, a corn tortilla is going to make
it that much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I feel sometimes about
really good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some other hash from some other
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if it's both the same, that could be
kind of cool to just have like a stronger
[SPEAKER_02]: version of Skittles or a stronger version
of diesel or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally people like mix them and it
all, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all just a bunch of jumbled shit to
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm weird like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, the art of mixing no doubt has
existed for a very, very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we might leave it at that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, we've thoroughly explored a number
of issues before we sign off any final
[SPEAKER_00]: words.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, back on that one,
like whatever people like to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you enjoy it, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like your joint better with hash up
the mill, you better throw some hash in
[SPEAKER_02]: the middle of it and enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like that, that's what you like,
you know, same with any of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like all this kind of weed we were
talking about, and that's your favorite,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's your favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just try, take, you know, think about all
these things being a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they, maybe they might make sense and
if they don't, then don't bother for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely want to say as someone
who is ardently against smoking tobacco,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is undeniably something magical
about a little snake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of hash among some tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't deny it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very neat, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then we can go when I was a kid
and I was going to Amsterdam, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: to buy seeds in the mid nineties,
because that's where I knew how to get
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, they, they don't smoke weed over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They mix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're in a coffee shop in
winter and it's all closed up and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: four or five different groups,
each smoking a big spliff, with a big hash
[SPEAKER_01]: snake down the center and a bunch of
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just so much tobacco smoke in
the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was times I had to leave certain
clubs because I was like, this is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke filled tobacco room I think I've
ever been in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my lungs are shutting down and maybe
I'm a pussy, but I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, like if you've ever seen a huge
spliff, just being chieft, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and like all that hash smoke and all that
tobacco smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look around, there's like
four or five different types of smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look around and there's more
of them getting passed in different
[SPEAKER_01]: groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of who's sat in like my buddy's
old Chevy or whatever, back in the day
[SPEAKER_02]: when we were, when we were teenagers and
rolled up like the shake, that's the only
[SPEAKER_02]: thing you can get in a little resident
rolling up joints, this big around and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, three sheeters or whatever,
and just trying to smoke all that in the
[SPEAKER_02]: hot box to try to like, all right,
we're going to get high somehow off of
[SPEAKER_02]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we going to do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, taking bong hits and try keefing
it and trying to put that back in there
[SPEAKER_02]: and make it a little stronger and all this
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't like to sit in a place where
people are smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't smoke inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll smoke a joint inside if we're like,
like me and you not so consider my living
[SPEAKER_02]: room and smoke a joint and it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there's like 20 of us somewhere in
our room, I'd be outside that much porch,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to go outside and it's not even,
it's like literally every, like a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of that smoke comes off the joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of it came out of somebody's mouth
and when you're sitting in a smoky room,
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're really looking at is
everybody's breath with smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bad enough that you're in there with
the breath mixed with a bunch of stale ass
[SPEAKER_02]: burnt, whatever the fuck we're burning all
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, like, yeah, hash weed,
whatever it is, especially if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, no, dude, this is stale.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is funky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to take, I want to have my own
joint or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to probably be outside and I want
to sit there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of times I like to smoke by
myself and kind of meditate about shit and
[SPEAKER_02]: things and get some ideas and some
inspiration and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just how I tend to like to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I kind of lose all the rest of
it when I just sit and I'd rather just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of do that when I'm doing that and do
this when I'm doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And probably it's, you know, slightly
neurodivergent, but I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it works for you, it works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Touch of the chism, touch of the chism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit.
Gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, comprehensive as always.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you, Minji.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not so dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Signing off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone have a wonderful night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
