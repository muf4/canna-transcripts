[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate your ongoing support.
[SPEAKER_04]: The final piece of the puzzle to ensure
that your room is killing it is our good
[SPEAKER_04]: friends at Pulse.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their sensors are second to none.
[SPEAKER_04]: Industry leading and just recently,
they announced the Pulse Hub.
[SPEAKER_04]: What more could you want?
[SPEAKER_04]: An integrated unit for all of your sensors
to ensure that your garden is automated
[SPEAKER_04]: and tracking all of the variables you may
not be consciously aware of.
[SPEAKER_04]: From VPD to PPF, dew point, temperature,
humidity, so much more.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to get yourself a Pulse sensor,
guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is revolutionary.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to recognize the way I grow
flour and increase the terpene content,
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabinoid content, the yield,
so, so, so much more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out, as always, to our friends at
Pulse sensors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Likewise, if any of you guys have been
listening to the show, you know that I am
[SPEAKER_04]: passionate about helping people transition
to vaporized options if they're
[SPEAKER_04]: considerate about their respiratory
health.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, Dynavap are the world leaders in
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dynavap helped me to transition from bongs
to vaping.
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell you what, I've never looked back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their unit is the most potent,
the most highly replicating of a bong hit
[SPEAKER_04]: I've ever come across.
[SPEAKER_04]: And through their incredible M unit,
I was able to successfully get off bongs a
[SPEAKER_04]: few years ago now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Truly one of the most innovative and
interesting vapes on the market,
[SPEAKER_04]: using a totally different design to others
you've found.
[SPEAKER_04]: Check these guys out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You will not be disappointed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Massive shout out to Dynavap.

[SPEAKER_04]: We got a good one today for you,
gang.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people have been asking
for this a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been thinking about it and we finally
got the stars to align and we made it
[SPEAKER_04]: happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big shout out to our buddy, a longtime fan
of the show as well, Daz of Night Out,
[SPEAKER_04]: taking the time to come chat with us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Incredibly grateful as always.
[SPEAKER_04]: So without further delay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty gang, welcome back for another
one and on today we have one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: biggest names in the auto breeding world,
Head of Night Out Seeds, a company that is
[SPEAKER_04]: synonymous with some of the highest
quality auto flower breeding in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: A massive, massive thank you and welcome
to Daz for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor to be here on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a fan since the very first
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I was just saying before we
started and I've never felt like I was at
[SPEAKER_00]: the level to even be associated with the
guest you've had on before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, thank you for having me and I'll
do my best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, I love that because it speaks to the
organic roots that a lot of people in the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry have.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like yourself, I started out as a fan just
watching Subcool and who would have
[SPEAKER_04]: thought we'd be here chatting to each
other one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what's funny?
[SPEAKER_04]: You referenced episode one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't mentioned it to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to be told this before.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got that same southern accent that
Duke has in episode one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long time down in South
Carolina, so that's interesting to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: My accent, I'm sure, picked up from quite
a few locations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've moved around all over the place from
Maryland to South Carolina, to West
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia, to Colorado, to Boston or
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm up in Maine, so I've been all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, definitely southern roots there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: You truly have been a bit of everywhere by
the sounds of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to ask you, just as a quick one,
how would you describe the state of the
[SPEAKER_04]: East Coast scene at the moment?
[SPEAKER_04]: The impression I get is that it's sort of
booming and going through a bit of a boom
[SPEAKER_04]: phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I've had some of the best flower
in the world in New York City here
[SPEAKER_00]: recently within the past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scene there is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of the associations in
Barcelona or the coffee shops over in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam, except a little bit more wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: The events they have in the city are just
absolutely stellar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel like you're in a movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a big office building.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get on the elevator, go up to the 12th
floor, the doors open, the smoke just
[SPEAKER_00]: billows into the elevator, and all of a
sudden you're in a lounge with a little
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee bar, food, vendor tables
everywhere, couches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really, really have something special
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say Virginia as well is really,
really doing big things, which is a state
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really associated with ever having
legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got arrested in Richmond, Virginia when
I was 18 years old for weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a place that I never ever thought
would boom the way it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, when I was 21 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Virginia, I've had a shady past with as
far as that's concerned, but some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best weed I actually ever smoked was ... I
used to have a business or a job that
[SPEAKER_00]: would take me on the road every night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would stay in a hotel in this little
college town in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: The girl at the front desk of this hotel
eventually became friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be there every other week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually asked, you want to come smoke
some weed or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: One time I didn't have any.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know where I could get
some?
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like, yeah, my husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come over to our house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went over and it was the first time I
ever had fresh homegrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh my God, it was White Widow
and still to this day, it was some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: best flower I've ever had in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, Virginia and I and cannabis have
a nice little love-hate relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the East Coast is doing a great
thing, but I can't wait for the rest of it
[SPEAKER_00]: to open up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a cool story from Virginia and White
Widow.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a brilliant kind bud introduction to
have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that was epic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of curiosity, have you ever been
tempted to pick up a pack of White Widow
[SPEAKER_04]: from somewhere and chase that Holy Grail?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to try the Sharon White
Widow that's around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't asked anybody for it in a few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to reach out to breeders all the
time and people that I looked up to and
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to let it be known I'm not out here
to rip anybody off or do anything shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to try some of this, even if it's
just the flower, not necessarily getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: cut or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just never had any luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird the way this has progressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember in-house genetics, maybe 2015,
2016, reaching out and being like,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, I'd love to collab on an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just kind of maybe one day,
maybe one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just last year, he reached out to me
and was like, man, I'd love to collab on
[SPEAKER_00]: an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, fuck yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sent him some pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if he's got those going quite
yet, but he sent me pictures of the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's a weird turn of events the
way auto flowers have kind of started to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more recognized by the photo period
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are starting to understand that
they do have a place in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of curiosity, are you willing to let
out of the bag?
[SPEAKER_04]: Which pollen did you send him?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you could just pick a couple
hybrids you'd love to see made out of his
[SPEAKER_04]: library, what's on the radar for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe I sent him the crinkled cookies,
feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I also sent him some wizards
apprentice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feminized pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was the crinkled cookies
that he ended up using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure he used it to maybe a
slur cane.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had something black cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to look at my notes to see
exactly what he was going to use on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had made a cross with the slur cane
cut that was floating around back in 2019
[SPEAKER_00]: or so, maybe 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only time that I think I've ever
had a plant that was dudding is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: was called back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think it's HLVD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it just kind of died,
just kind of stopped mid flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those seeds, that seed stock I just
set aside and never touched again because
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't ever want to reintroduce that or
grow anything that had that viroid and
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly contaminate other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I still have that seed stock locked
away separate from everything else just
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe for future reference someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sorry, I forgot what the question was.
[SPEAKER_04]: You answered it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which hybrids would you like to see?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you noticed slur cane would be a great
pairing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a fan of it for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just mentioned HLVD, the hoplite
and viroid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing that you just stimulated in
my mind was an interesting thought,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You often hear about it in the context of
clones because they sort of pick it up and
[SPEAKER_04]: then it's just in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really don't hear about it with autos.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I guess it got me thinking,
have you seen plants with what you
[SPEAKER_04]: suspect, not necessarily your own,
but just via other people, auto plants
[SPEAKER_04]: that have it and how does it manifest?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I guess I'm wondering,
would it just be like lower yield and
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or would it maybe stress the plant in a
way that's like how sometimes the auto
[SPEAKER_04]: will just stop growing and just go into
flower at this really small stage?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you seen any autos infected and what
was the symptoms looking like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: None that I've been aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just speaking again before the
interview and I have seen some seed stock
[SPEAKER_00]: going around from other people that the
plants are just kind of stunted and
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced all consistently across the
board, all with a certain seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've seen people say, have these
been tested for the hoplite and viroid or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really can't say that I've ever seen
it in autos before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not to say that it isn't out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much just stick to my own stuff,
stuff that I'm familiar with, stock that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had for the past decade or more at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I can't say that I've ever
actually seen it for sure, other than the
[SPEAKER_00]: one time where I think I got the dirty
clone of the slurricane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fair enough, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was thinking like, it's actually an
interesting question in that, like who
[SPEAKER_04]: knows, maybe in some sense autos are less
prone to hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously there's the literal
aspect of they're not really cloned,
[SPEAKER_04]: so they don't stay around long enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also maybe there's some other sort of
underlying genetic trait associated with
[SPEAKER_04]: being an auto that, who knows,
it's an interesting one to ponder.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to get us back on track, I wanted to
quickly ask you, because a question I've
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to ask you for a long time,
because you're the man to answer it is,
[SPEAKER_04]: in your mind, what has been the most
impressive auto flower you've ever tried?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember like that moment where you
were like, wow, this is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have some favorites for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think to me, the most impressive thing
that I've ever come across with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: my older brother and some of his friends
were my toughest critics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a long time, you know,
I started growing, then I found out some
[SPEAKER_00]: of his friends were growing and they had
some clones and stuff that I really wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took me a few years of growing
autos and playing with autos to get to a
[SPEAKER_00]: point where they used to claim,
you know, we can taste the auto flower in
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, what does it taste
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain to me what the auto trait
tastes like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could never really express that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually, I grew some stuff and they
were like, wow, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's an auto and they're
like, this is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's an auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, they let me have access
to a subcool clone of space dog,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like the thing that growing up
and kind of my circle was like the end all
[SPEAKER_00]: be all top tier clone of that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they let me use that and I worked with
it and came back to them years later with
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the dude that held that cut smoked it
and was just like, this is the space dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like kind of the high
watermark of like, I know I'm on the right
[SPEAKER_00]: path here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes the proper work,
the selections and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just just understanding kind of the plants
and what you're selecting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was like the first one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, with the Zamo Delica
Express is one that I'm super proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, really, really nice,
true sativa and auto flower format.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just super uplifting and heady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the the soured evil stuff that
I've been working on here recently are
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the stinkiest autos I've ever come
across hands down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, there's a few different kind
of high watermarks along the journey here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as pinpointing any one specific
moment, I mean, there's there's it just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of continues to evolve every couple
of years or something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like, damn, I can't believe
like this worked.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's that's really an interesting
point you raise there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the people will hate me if I don't
ask, you know, there's a million and one
[SPEAKER_04]: sour cuts out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which ones do you like and which one of
you used in the project?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this one, I used the AJ Sour Diesel
and I've currently got the Albany Sour
[SPEAKER_00]: Diesel Skunk Tech Choco got one from a
gentleman, Tony Soprano, who people say is
[SPEAKER_00]: like the real the real true sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, nowadays they have sour
competitions every single year to see who
[SPEAKER_00]: has the real sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like there is no kind of one real
sour anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people say, you know, the AJ Sour
Diesel isn't like a true sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just that's what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The AJ Sour Diesel Auto is what I've been
working on with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm using this piling from this to
cross to the other sour diesels to work
[SPEAKER_00]: those in the auto format.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had the J Plant speaker sour diesel
earlier this year, and that was fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some out in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little club called Cervantes out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy there had a sour diesel that's
super old.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was real nice, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this one is the AJ Sour Diesel
that I've worked in the auto and that'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be coming out probably next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to hold off and release
the Blue Power Lab this year and then do
[SPEAKER_00]: the AJ next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, that's that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a side note, do you think AJ looks
a little bit like Edward Norton?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now that you say that,
yeah, he does.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always thought that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, AJ kind of has like a timeless,
young look like he looks like he's always
[SPEAKER_00]: in college.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to meet him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him in the park in New York City
this past year with him and Top Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, damn, this is like a real New
York cannabis history moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a picture with both of them was just
like, this was this was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned to him, you know,
that I was working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought a little sack of AJ Sour Diesel
straight from the man himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still got it in my desk here with his
little signature on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, this is pretty
significant milestone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my life here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, he definitely I do see that
Edward Norton resemblance now that you say
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually was looking at your
Instagram last night and I saw that photo
[SPEAKER_04]: and I was like, that would have been a fun
time in that park on that day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just in the last question,
I mean, you referenced the Sour,
[SPEAKER_04]: but in the last questions, you referenced
the Zamadelica Express.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to formally ask, are you like
myself?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you more a fan of the Sativas than the
Indicas?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you impartial or are you more an
Indica guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, the Sativas for me, with my
breeding, I always and it's strange how
[SPEAKER_00]: this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like they think they like a
breeder, but they really like their palate
[SPEAKER_00]: and like of unintentionally bred to help
my ADHD and depression and off just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like personal issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in doing so, it's helped a bunch of
other people like they grow and they find
[SPEAKER_00]: the same relief from these things that
I've found.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, 100% Sativas for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the space dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: The space dog was like a super Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found actually what I've called the
super Sativa Fino within the cosmic queen,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the space dog auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of isolated that and been
growing and smoking that for myself over
[SPEAKER_00]: the past couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big, big fan favorite as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just did some stuff with that one
again here for the upcoming Halloween
[SPEAKER_00]: release.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the last time I released it was four
years ago for Halloween.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a nice little recombination of
that coming back around.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny?
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a question about the Halloween stuff
and essentially what I wanted to ask was I
[SPEAKER_04]: love how you do all these cool,
unique little drops.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure other people do Halloween drops,
but I feel like you have a lot of fun with
[SPEAKER_04]: it, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like there's a little bit of a
sentiment in the community at the moment
[SPEAKER_04]: that things are all a bit doom and gloom
and no one really seems like they're
[SPEAKER_04]: having fun anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to ask you, how do you keep it
light and what's your advice for people to
[SPEAKER_04]: keep cannabis and growing fun?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know it's cheesy, but you got to
love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be doing this whether I was
selling the seeds or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom sat me down in sixth grade because
I was no good in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was like, what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to do with your life?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I want to live on the side of
a mountain somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tropical and grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the dream for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got partially there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on the side of a mountain in
Colorado growing weed, but no real
[SPEAKER_00]: tropical location quite yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you really don't get in it for
the wrong reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a cash grab situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people get into it thinking this
is going to be some big booming industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember everybody wanted to be a master
grower for a time when that was the term
[SPEAKER_00]: going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody thought it was like big
bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you just can't get into it for
that reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what it's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plant won't treat you right if
that's how you treat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really kind of as simple as
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as keeping things invigorated,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, me and my buddy Zawan, who's my
graphics guy, we just have an absolute
[SPEAKER_00]: blast with coming up with new concepts and
new ideas for this upcoming Halloween one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing the collab with Sin City
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in Las Vegas, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It finally gave me the opportunity to do
some like Hunter S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thompson fear and loathing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coming up with all the designs for
that, coming up with like, we got some
[SPEAKER_00]: posters coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got like seven different sample
posters coming, holographic ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: gold, like variants, just a bunch of
different cool graphics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like to be able to express an
idea, an artistic idea to my buddy who can
[SPEAKER_00]: then put it into reality and create this
thing from a vision that I have,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's just words that I speak to
him, whether it's a sketch that I send
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And doing this business, I never wanted,
I owned a business before this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was in the fishing industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't something that I enjoyed
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something that I did because it was
a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I started growing, I was like,
wow, this is like really, where my passion
[SPEAKER_00]: is at.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can pursue this somehow and do enough
to make a living where I'm doing what I
[SPEAKER_00]: love, why wouldn't I want to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's not as lucrative as something
else, it's just way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I want to be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the freedom, when I say freedom,
I mean, you're on a planned schedule and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're kind of locked into that and you're
constantly doing upkeep and maintaining
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's just, it's all encompassing
this business where I can flex my
[SPEAKER_00]: creativity through the artwork side of
things, through the plant side of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: the interaction with the customers,
seeing other people grow, stuff that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: created and enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just so rewarding that there's,
I don't think there's anything else on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet like it, at least for me
personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that what you speak resonates
with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you've got to keep that element.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of passion alive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise it does just become monotonous
and a way to pay the bills.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, there's obviously a complex
answer to a simple question there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to cut you off, but another
thing with that is I'm constantly working
[SPEAKER_00]: to create something new so it never gets
stale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many amazing photo periods out
there more and more every year that I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: love to work with and turn into auto
format that, you know, that, that
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly keeps me motivated too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like, damn, Gary Payton,
like I know it's, it's a cookie family
[SPEAKER_00]: strain and then people will shit on cookie
stuff, but that Gary Payton's fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can't wait to work that in the auto
format for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's always something
new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm working on a piff auto with piff
coast, which is like phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably my, my favorite smoke
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the piff S2 number three,
the pineapple piff from Top Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just incredible stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, there's always something new
to be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of one of the downsides of what I
do is people always want stuff that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: released before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, I love everything I've created.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a fan of, but to go back, like takes
away from the current work and the current
[SPEAKER_00]: projects that I have going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only have so much space and so many
hours in a day that it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to make difficult decisions on
whether do I dedicate this space now to
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductions or do I continue working on
new projects?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of like my biggest,
my biggest downside of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, there's never enough time or
space to do everything that I want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look, I definitely want to delve into
some of the more technical aspects,
[SPEAKER_04]: but while we're on the topic, you know,
you're talking about cool and popular
[SPEAKER_04]: photo periods.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know you posted up an
interesting photo where it's sort of like
[SPEAKER_04]: a grid of nine different, really popular
strains that you had pollinated and were
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of considering converting to auto.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of those nine, which were some of the ones
that sort of jump out to you as ones you
[SPEAKER_04]: think you might pursue?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that apples and bananas,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one really caught me off guard
because I had no expectations going into
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but that one really was, was
incredible to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That and the honey banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the banana OG auto will be coming
out next year as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another one that I've been working
on, but this honey banana is beautiful in
[SPEAKER_00]: that the hash it produces was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It yields real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very beautiful plant to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another one that was in that
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see the thin man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd really like to do just for kind of the
sake of that being like such a sought
[SPEAKER_00]: after strain for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that it took me like eight
years to get ahold of like the real cut of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, man, well, I got to do this
due diligence to actually put this into
[SPEAKER_00]: auto format.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of what else was in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was two, maybe two grids of
nine each, but most of those I would fly
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Portland, Oregon to archive,
to grab from his dispensary out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would take me multiple trips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did this two times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it when I was in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went out multiple times throughout,
brought the stuff back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I got out to Maine,
I left those cuts out in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll fly back out there, grab them again,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this time I took my girlfriend out with
me and we get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could buy twice as many clones per day
because she was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stayed out there for the weekend,
loaded up with like 24, 30 clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was a hurricane in Boston,
which was the airport we were flying back
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our flight got delayed one day,
two days, three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had in our little hotel room,
I went out and bought lights, had a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: little veg garden in the bathroom of this
hotel room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went out to dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a text from the hotel saying,
there's been a smell of smoke on the floor
[SPEAKER_00]: you're staying on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we traced it back to your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get rid of this or else the
police will be involved, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the screenshots in my phone
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted it up at one point and I was
like, I should probably take this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, we get back to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I immediately drive back, I don't respond
to the text.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had stayed at this hotel six,
seven times before because I would stay in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same hotel every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a hotel from like the 1950s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: All old people there at the front desk,
they give you cookies when you check in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the night before it was a new person
I'd never seen before, like when I checked
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, oh, dude, you have
those cookies or whatever, kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to build rapport with this new
person that I'd never seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, oh, here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I get to the hotel,
I was like, I just wanted to let you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been no smoking in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand what's going on and I'll
get it taken care of, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a young girl behind the desk
with him that was like, we went in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got pictures, we know exactly what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, go up to the hotel room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The door's locked and my key won't work
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, fuck, are the cops going to
be downstairs, like waiting in the lobby
[SPEAKER_00]: when I go back down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this just them wanting me to get back
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, whatever could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go back down, act like, you know,
nothing's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, look, the key doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is everything okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, oh, let me get you a new
key.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old guy was like, on my side against
this, this young girl that was working
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, yeah, let me let me get you a
new key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just I've got my medical card,
like everything is above board.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just can't have that here in the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So took some empty suitcases out
immediately to make up look like we just
[SPEAKER_00]: took everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I sat there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants, archive clones are the best
possible clones you could get in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're teens there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can take three, four or five
clones off what he sells as clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started breaking stuff down,
chopping it into little clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in Ziploc bags, label and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to mess anything up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took me probably two hours to actually
break everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really take the actual not the
decoy suitcases, but the real suitcases
[SPEAKER_00]: out with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the clones, I've got the the
snips as well, packed in two suitcases,
[SPEAKER_00]: take them out and just never go back
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like the end of that went to
some motel eight, just like the lowest
[SPEAKER_00]: tier hotel you could ever stay in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people next to me like homeless kids
like in the room next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we got a smoking like a cigarette
smoking room, which you don't find
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, all right, this place is going to
give two shits about what I got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got way bigger fish to fry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have literal prostitutes in the
parking lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to get in any trouble
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the flight gets delayed three
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plans are just you know,
they're they're they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, they're they're whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pack them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally get on the flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay, we get to the airport and the
flight gets delayed again, as we're there
[SPEAKER_00]: after I've already sent my bags to be put
up in a plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, shit, well, we got the hotel
room for another night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let me pull the bags off the
flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back to the hotel room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll leave in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked them to pull my bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, all right, go down to the
baggage claim area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be down in about an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: An hour goes by two hours go by three
hours go by I go back up to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: check in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, hey, they said they were going to
pull these.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lady behind the desk is like,
they didn't pull them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go now you've got a half hour to catch
your flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I just want to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want me to get on this flight and
my bags stay here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, should I stay here and send my
girlfriend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way we've got our bases covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lady behind the counters like no,
they are on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, all right, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get on the flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another family boards right after us
starts throwing up on the flight like a
[SPEAKER_00]: few rows behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kick them off the flight and they
find their bags within five minutes to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove them off the plane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, all right, well, if they found
their bags that quick than ours that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a text in the air mid flight saying
your bags are on their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were flying into Boston.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bags are on their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're they're on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like six in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bags aren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so they're like, all right,
you got to go talk to whatever the bag
[SPEAKER_00]: agent now explain what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But track your bags down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get them to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the 70 year old woman
explaining, you know, we lost our bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has to look in on like, all right,
do I just tell her the truth here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what the fuck's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tell her clothes, you know,
toiletries, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I say there's hemp in there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's hemp plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just flew out to the East Coast to grab
these specific hemp cultivars that are
[SPEAKER_00]: highly sought after for my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's very important that I get
these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lady is like, my husband just
started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like this old woman and her old
husband, I guess, since things went legal
[SPEAKER_00]: in Massachusetts had decided to pick up
the hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was super intrigued by the whole
thing and like, really, really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, she was like, Yeah,
I appreciate you telling me this,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, we'll get your bags to you as soon
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they're going to be flying
into New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another day goes by, I hear nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another day goes by, I hear nothing on the
third day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My bags just show up on my porch,
plants in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all look like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been without light for,
you know, three, four days at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, I pulled them all out of it,
got them set up in the tent, vegged them
[SPEAKER_00]: all back out, put the clones into root,
got a couple to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: But luckily, I had saved the actual rooted
like things that I had chopped out the
[SPEAKER_00]: snips off of, potted those up immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, within within a month,
they were beautiful, healthy plants again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of like, the amazing things
about about cannabis, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to live, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got pictures of all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I documented the whole thing because I
knew one day I'd want to tell the story
[SPEAKER_00]: and share like, just how crazy these
experiences are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, you know, it rewards you if
you put in the work and you're dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant knows that, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it picks up on those vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I don't even remember where
again, where we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, oh, you were talking about the grids
of the nine plants each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those cuts came from archive
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, all of them were amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever need clones, archive in
Portland, Oregon, can't find better clones
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can attest, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I too have visited the dispensary in
Portland many moons ago and picked up some
[SPEAKER_04]: plants and tried to make them magically
appear in Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sadly, didn't quite work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, I wanted to ask you, and this is a
bit of a change of pace because I love
[SPEAKER_04]: that answer, but I really want to get
into, what was your thoughts on some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the early auto work and specifically
Lowrider?
[SPEAKER_04]: What was your thoughts on Lowrider?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never grown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate what the joint doctor did to
popularize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it in high times all the time and it
intrigued me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I got into growing autos was I
moved down to South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to go down to South Carolina and
spend my summers down there because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where my grandparents lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: After high school, I moved down there to
go to college and start the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made some connections to get herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the third or fourth meeting,
I ended up getting jumped and robbed and
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole messy situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, it's not worth this to
do the plant thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not worth the violence aspect in
order to get the shitty weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the fastest way that I can actually
get a harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flowers was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what got me into growing auto
flowers in the first place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's actually a really interesting
introduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we do it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we go back to the start?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me about your first memory,
first interaction with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told this story on the Dark Forest
podcast before about my older brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd say the first time I smoked was
with my older brother going to this little
[SPEAKER_00]: drag strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember drinking some tobacco,
which is like this kind of orange liqueur
[SPEAKER_00]: and smoking a joint and going to this
racetrack and just being terrified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought my throat was closing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this is laced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I must be allergic to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to die, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, I remembered,
oh my God, when I was in fourth grade,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my brother was in sixth or seventh
grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom found his bowl and his bag of flour
and called the cops to our house to arrest
[SPEAKER_00]: him or scare arrest him.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was truly my first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that wasn't even truly my first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first of like, I know what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before that, my dad had 18 acres down
in Maryland and he had this old country
[SPEAKER_00]: boy that would grow his own tobacco and
mixed in with that tobacco or cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't know because I was four or
five, six years old at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like my very first introduction
to it was that without even knowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's been a few kind of first
introductions, whether I was aware of it
[SPEAKER_00]: or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd say probably fourth grade was
the first time that I really was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you remember the first time you got
high?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it the first time you smoked or was it
a subsequent time after?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was the first time I was going to
that racetrack.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother had 78 Cadillac DeVille with
like a full sound system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember like some of the songs we
were listening to at the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: the very first Ludacris album and some
mindless self-indulgence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just a weird, weird mix of
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was the very first time was
going to that drag strip.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how did your interest in cannabis
progress over the years towards,
[SPEAKER_04]: say, when you did your first grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a band called 311.
[SPEAKER_00]: That everybody makes fun of as like one of
the worst bands in the world or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But their first few albums had so much
cannabis related, so many cannabis themes
[SPEAKER_00]: to them throughout that it just intrigued
me that this plant could like motivate and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring people together the way it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then seeing their home videos of like
concerts and stuff, it was like more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: modern kind of dead scene parking lot
scene where, you know, everybody was like
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking and trading and doing that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, nowadays, they're almost looked
at as the butt of a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, they were like something
really, they're still really special to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, their modern stuff does sound like
a parody of themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, it was like this this
special thing of like just this niche
[SPEAKER_00]: community of people that were into this
music and this smoking and this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: mindset of like, you know, fuck what
people are going to tell me to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all about money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about community and like bringing
people together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sharing and joy and that kind of
influenced me so heavy as a kid and still
[SPEAKER_00]: does to this day that that that kind of
continued throughout my entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like when like I was saying
in sixth grade when my mom sat me down,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was so heavily influenced by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't even smoked at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, man, to see the effect
that this has on people, the positive
[SPEAKER_00]: effect that it has on people really left
an impression on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to explore that as soon as I
could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was kind of kind of like the
through line of what's motivated me
[SPEAKER_00]: through all of this was that early on
introduction through music.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, I mean, at first, were you growing
photo period?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first grow was in high school,
just some bags, heat stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember finding out that you had to
flip the lights to get them to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these plants we were growing at my
buddy's house in his garage in like the
[SPEAKER_00]: attic of his garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his mom found them and was like,
you got to get these out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we took them over to my dad's farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he found them and was like,
you got to get these out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I threw them in the back of a truck and
like started to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he saw me leaving with these plants in
the back of a truck was like, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so I kept them there on the farm and
grow them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember asking my buddy,
like, how did you get these so big and
[SPEAKER_00]: like so healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, miracle grow spike.
[SPEAKER_00]: And diesel fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for two weeks, I was just like,
what the do I really put diesel fuel on me
[SPEAKER_00]: is like, I shoved 100 miracle grow spikes
in these pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then years later, I was like,
bro, like, did you use I was just talking
[SPEAKER_00]: with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was that was my first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember what I did find out about,
you know, putting on putting them on 1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy's dad came over to visit and was
like, so stoked to check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were in a bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he left the overhead bathroom light on
that wasn't on a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they were in flower and I was out of
town doing my business stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came back and the light was on and I
like, I freaked out at a minute like it
[SPEAKER_00]: soured our relationship like the dude was
like, you think I would yell at your dad
[SPEAKER_00]: like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I was like, I'm sorry, I was just
this is something that I've invested so
[SPEAKER_00]: much time and so much energy into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I don't know, I just felt like
this whole thing just got fucked up for
[SPEAKER_00]: for nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I shouldn't have told anybody what I
was doing to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for this to happen was just like,
oh, but anyway, we worked it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was good and still a friend to
this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, no worries there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time, it was like the biggest
thing that had ever happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was so stoked to finally be in
flower, like doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, then it'll be in super long
flowering Mexican sativa things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: chopped early and then took down to South
Carolina with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like my little bumper crop sort
of thing that I took down and that got me
[SPEAKER_00]: over in South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I met people at the college down
there to actually get flower from and then
[SPEAKER_00]: all that other stuff transpired and got me
right back into growing, but with autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this time I was serious about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me about your first time growing an
auto.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you remember what it was?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that the eureka moment or was it a few
more grows after that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the first would have been
probably some Dutch passion stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found someone online that was doing
it well and that was yielding well and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was having amazing results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just followed his method exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time he was posting exactly what
was going into his name was Seymour Bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started getting like Gotham
hydro LEDs was another company that was
[SPEAKER_00]: big at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would buy those and I just followed
exactly the same seeds that he had,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same nutrients that he had and
starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my first harvest was like 10 ounces
off of a single auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was blown away that I was able to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, just, yeah, that was the
eureka moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing was, and this is not to
throw, this is probably more on my skills
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time rather than genetics
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like, I've got 10 ounces of
shit that I don't really want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lacking in almost every department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, this was my first
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I moved on to other, other
breeders and other genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each time it got a little bit better
and a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: People were doing this the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a formula to creating and making
these things better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me follow that formula myself and try
my hand at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of what got me started
in the whole breeding aspect of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before we jump into a bit more of like
your story, I just want to quickly ask you
[SPEAKER_04]: more of, shall we say a philosophical
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is, I have been wondering this and
other people have asked as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, do you think that to an extent
breeding autos requires more skill or do
[SPEAKER_04]: you think that simply it requires skill,
but also there's sort of inherently like a
[SPEAKER_04]: bit of luck involved as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least in one step that, you know,
you might go really good in your first
[SPEAKER_04]: generation and that sets you up for
success thereafter.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess I'm wondering, do you think
it's just more difficult or that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: difficult, but there's also a luck
component?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every photo breeder that I work with is
like, damn, this is what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like by the time we get to working their
screen into an auto, they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is way harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even shout out to seats here now,
James Bean back in 2015, 2016 was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys are doing real work.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so much harder than photo period
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every aspect of it is more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no keeping clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to make the wrong selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to breed back the ruderalis
stuff to impact the gene pool negatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of like pitfalls that you
can find yourself kind of jumping over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a lot of luck involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like, you know, any one person
is just going to be the best auto period
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder 100% of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: On default, it's a game of skill as much
as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I lucked out and found the right
things this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe not as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of, you know, running the
proper numbers, making sure you have
[SPEAKER_00]: backup plans for every step of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's a lot of hard work and a
lot of skill involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, a lot of luck too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure we'll talk about that when we
talk about some of the technical aspects
[SPEAKER_04]: of breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted to quickly ask you,
I've only spoken to a very small number of
[SPEAKER_04]: people who have bred autos, but they've
all sort of shared many common sentiments.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of them being that it's incredibly
easy to sort of dud an auto line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I'm wondering, how often is it
that you find you sort of say to yourself,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I need to go back a couple of
generations or, you know, I need to
[SPEAKER_04]: restart this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gone wrong at some point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it happen commonly or is it a bit
less common these days?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm knocking on wood right now because
fortunately it hasn't happened too many
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's maybe two projects I'd say that I
could go back and revisit and redo better
[SPEAKER_00]: than I've done before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, I'm really, really
genuinely happy with everything that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's all been really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all been improvements upon what they
used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it is easy to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think, I don't know if epigenetics is
the right term, but you can see something
[SPEAKER_00]: from one generation carried over into the
seed stock of the next generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: way more so than you would with a photo
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have noticed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same for, you know, you grow a huge auto
of both parents being huge, grown
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly, the seed resulting from those
come out impeccable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely something to that
and to locking in both negative and
[SPEAKER_00]: positive traits within the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we can get into that,
I guess a little bit more when we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about breeding, but really you just,
you got to be there for them early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a old Chinese saying proverbs
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the best nutrient is the
gardener shadow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of those things where you
really have to be there and then care for
[SPEAKER_00]: them, especially the first four weeks or
so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's two follow-ups I want to ask
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the first one is what would be your
advice for someone like myself who sees
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the photos you post and you're
like, Oh my God, that is the biggest auto
[SPEAKER_04]: flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when you see a whole plant in a pot
at harvest, you're like, that thing is
[SPEAKER_04]: huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, as you said, like really huge
yield off it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of the tips you would give
people to help get an auto to that size?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I think for a lot of us,
it's very rare.
[SPEAKER_04]: To see something go that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hydro, you can't go wrong with,
with autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: The deep water culture really led itself
to gigantic autos because there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same for cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get huge in that really the fluffier,
the soil, the less resistance against the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots, the bigger and the longer they'll
veg for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they run into too compacted soil,
if it's too dense, it sends a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Message to the plant that, Hey,
you know, we're out of space here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the end of our life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to carry on into the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flip into flower now while we have
ample space to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of one of the things is
just giving them enough root space early
[SPEAKER_00]: on and having proper soil and fluffiness
to the soil so that the roots can really
[SPEAKER_00]: spread out easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not much resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's really, you can't overwater
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't underwater them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do either of those, they'll stunt
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really learning kind of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, I crossed back to photos,
read them out the autos again,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get more resilient a lot of the times
each generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I've also learned over the past 10
years of, you know, you can transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to yield as much,
but you can do it properly where it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't completely stunt them out and
affect the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nowadays with things like auto pots
and the tray to grow system where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're taking up the amount of
water they want to be taking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can start a bunch in small
pots and that sort of system and then
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant them into bigger, bigger
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't miss a beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really kind of developing the
understanding of when to transplant them,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's too late, when to cut your
losses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, just, just, there's,
there's no replacement for actually doing
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just kind of a hands-on thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could explain it a hundred times and
until you actually do it and learn it and
[SPEAKER_00]: are hands-on with it, it's just,
it's hard to, to, to wrap your head
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to grasp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of something that you have to do
to learn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And look, I want to ask a bit of a newbie
question as someone who has only grown
[SPEAKER_04]: about four or five autos before.
[SPEAKER_04]: When people transplant the autos,
I often hear them having this very
[SPEAKER_04]: particular focus on being like in a
tactile sense, very gentle with the root
[SPEAKER_04]: ball.
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, you know, no, no one
advocates for man handling a root ball,
[SPEAKER_04]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wonder, do you think that that very
like literally as gently as you can
[SPEAKER_04]: transplanting it and just, just,
just so lightly tapping it down,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do you think that sort of thing does
make a difference or do you think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: more about like the general health of the
plant when we talk about stressing the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a firm believer that the more gentle,
the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, to this day, that's something that I
still focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I rarely ever had help with,
with anything in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do pretty much everything myself from
obtaining the clones to harvesting the
[SPEAKER_00]: four auto seeds at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's all me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I ever do have somebody come in,
that's the most important thing that I
[SPEAKER_00]: stress is if there's a transplant,
I usually will explain to them exactly how
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it done and then do it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I just, I don't have,
I'm not going to delegating
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this, it's like, that's the most
critical stage of the whole thing is like
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure to, to minimize the stunting
as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely believe in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, that's key.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to ask on that topic,
you know, you've mentioned soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to hear a bit more about your
grow style, just generally speaking,
[SPEAKER_04]: because, you know, I, I do hear people at
times say you should grow with lighter
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients for orders.
[SPEAKER_04]: So love to hear your thoughts on that,
but also if you could tell us a bit about
[SPEAKER_04]: the, the awesome CoLab you have with our
buddies at Builder Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the longest time, pretty much as,
as soon as I stopped doing hydro,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I stopped doing because as I started
to grow, grow more and more plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I upgraded my pump to a big kind of like a
pond sized pump, a big, big boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't upgrade the manifold or the
tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was still running through all super
small tubing, which created back pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: on the pump and then heated up the
reservoirs and caused me to get root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had to learn about, well,
what was it called at the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Heisenberg tea was what people were
calling it at the time, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a, a worm casting tea with a few
other things in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used that to kind of get through and
fight the root rot off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it went from being a, what was
supposed to be a completely sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: environment into, well, now I'm doing some
sort of hybrid hydro organic synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, I switched to super soil and I
started mixing up the Vic high sub pool
[SPEAKER_00]: style super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I would do for that was I would
take a five gallon bucket and I would do
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom half with a super soil mixed
into roots original.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the top half would be just
unamended roots original.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, out of the bag, it has amendments in
it, but just roots, original soil on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the auto would have time to
establish in that before hitting the
[SPEAKER_00]: hotter stuff, because we planted them into
hot soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put them directly into the super
soil, they would just stun out because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was just too much for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would give the roots time to
establish before hitting that hotter
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they absolutely love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I stuck with that for basically until
two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my, my methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I use once I switched.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always did, like I said, five gallon
buckets and then seeing all these autopot
[SPEAKER_00]: grows and people just getting these
absolute monsters and autopots really had
[SPEAKER_00]: me scratching my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was always of the mindset that
fuck automation, you know, like that takes
[SPEAKER_00]: the passion out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes your skill out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's just, it's, it's for,
for meds, it's for corporate cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I actually tried it with the
super soil and could not believe the
[SPEAKER_00]: results, but because of how big and how
quickly they grew in this auto pot
[SPEAKER_00]: setting, they would eat through all the
amendments that were usually enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: carry them through to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it became, all right, well,
I got to figure out top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll have to hit them like in an
emergency situation with some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic liquid nutrients just to get them
something faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I've switched to build a soil 3.0,
which everybody told me was going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: too hot for autos too strong, but man,
they absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I transplant into 3.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still start them out in roots original
transplant into the 3.0 into the 6.6
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon auto pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't beat it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just, they are incredible.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and do you top dress?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of the amendments you like
to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: As of now, I haven't been top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been doing the 3.0, but I do
have build a flower here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I ever do need to do that,
I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have to top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing a warehouse in Colorado about
two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like my first major run and
auto pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they just caught me off guard
with how huge they got and how quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: they went through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did have to top dress there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that, let's see, as far as top
dressing, yeah, build a, build a flower is
[SPEAKER_00]: really the main one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to throw a worm castings on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've started putting black trash bags,
putting them out and putting them on the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have feeder roots at the very top
when you lift it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They even grow mushrooms and stuff under
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so now, in case of emergency,
if I ever do need to top dress,
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots are right there ready to take it
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was something that I saw through
Jeremy had build a soil through his
[SPEAKER_00]: videos, I think with our earth box,
he pulled the cover back and showed all
[SPEAKER_00]: the feeder roots right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, man, I need to implement
this somehow with what I got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of the impetus for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, really, it's just total soil
amendments at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as the slab stuff goes,
he's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to do like a proper auto flower
slab with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be honest, the 3.0 is kicking ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really not much if it was a
little bit fluffier, that would be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even as is, I mean, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the flower from us phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really just a few small tweaks
that could be made to improve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we first started talking,
he thought the 3.0 would be way too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he made a very, very, very loose soil
with almost no amendments in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one, he would have to top dress
and work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as I tried the 3.0,
I saw other people trying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Is that too hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, No, man, it works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing really, I mean,
I'd love to clap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to do an auto soil like we had
talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's it's almost not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you kind of know what you're doing with
the 3.0 and kind of transplanting at the
[SPEAKER_00]: right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I wasn't transplanting into it,
I would do the same kind of layered
[SPEAKER_00]: situation that I had done before with the
super soil, where I'd put the 3.0 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom of the pots and then an unamended
soil light next or something in the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my method now, I'm constantly
transplanting in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that works.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's that's really cool to hear that
the 3.0 works for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was just sort of thinking,
you know, like it's it's been so cool and
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting to see how many people have
been watching the Build A Soil YouTube
[SPEAKER_04]: series.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's so massively popular.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, to see your genetics sort
of shining in there, that must be really
[SPEAKER_04]: cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: While we're on the topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, sorry, while we're on the
philosophical topics, I should say,
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to ask you this.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your thoughts on this sort of
perception that auto flowers are for
[SPEAKER_04]: beginners?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're a stepping stone to photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just I get it because of auto
and the name, the perception of them and
[SPEAKER_00]: that people think, you know, they're not
as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact of the matter is,
if you can grow an auto flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grow a photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can grow a photo period,
it's not necessarily the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of photo period people get their
egos put in check real quick when they try
[SPEAKER_00]: to do an auto flower and stump them out,
stump them out, stump them out and just
[SPEAKER_00]: write them off as, you know, these suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're exactly what I had in my mind of
what an auto flower would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little popsicle bud, when in reality,
you've got to change what you're doing in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to maximize an auto flowers
potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is no slight to photo periods at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with them every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact of the matter is,
in general, auto flowers are way more
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you learn to grow an auto flower,
well, you'll have zero issues growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, photo periods, I've seen a time
again, where they actually make auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower growers lazy, because you can veg
them for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can play catch up with them where
if you look at an auto flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say a longer running one has 100
days life cycle, each day is 1% of its
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you mess up early on, you're not
getting that those days back and you
[SPEAKER_00]: fucked up kind of your foundation for the
rest of its life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no no rewinding the clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no re-vegging.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing you can do at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for a lot of photo period growers,
that do try autos, I tell them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to stuff these out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go in expecting that you're going to
stunt your first few out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But give it a few tries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get over that learning curve,
the reward is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The explosion of growth, the speed,
the resilience of the plants once you get
[SPEAKER_00]: to a certain point in their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go in every day and you see the
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even you do, you visit your plants a
few times a day, you can see different
[SPEAKER_00]: growth throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're that quick at certain stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back to your poplite and viroid
question earlier with autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of me wonders if the speed of their
growth kind of is faster than the viroid
[SPEAKER_00]: could catch up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know like the viroid hangs out kind
of a lot of times in the lower parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can clone a healthy part at top,
or even you can test different parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and it'll be present at some
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some parts and not the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do wonder if there's something to
that of like, just simply the sheer speed
[SPEAKER_00]: at which an auto grows does not allow for
that to actually kind of manifest itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I've not seen them in autos
that I am aware of that I could say,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, you know, the viroid here in this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I've been again, touch wood
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super fortunate that I haven't dealt
with that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope to never deal with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say either way, but you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in normal plant, the meristem
doesn't attach to the xylem and phloem for
[SPEAKER_04]: a certain period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you might be right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because as you said, you know,
photos, autos can really be taking off at
[SPEAKER_04]: a certain point.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a, that's an interesting
hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to ask you, I mean, given we've
spoken about that autos are now at the
[SPEAKER_04]: point where they don't need to be
considered the stepping stone to something
[SPEAKER_04]: better.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I guess the implication
that has been going on throughout this
[SPEAKER_04]: chat is that, you know, when, when done
right, it's, it's high quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's, you can't really tell the
difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to ask with that in mind,
where do you think the future of autos is
[SPEAKER_04]: heading?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that we're going to get to a
point where I've heard other guests say in
[SPEAKER_04]: the past is that they'll become very
common outdoors for commercial production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think even indoors for production,
years ago, when I first moved to Colorado,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a photo period farmer there,
60 lights, just crushing it with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with photos and he wanted to try autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I set him up with, with seeds to do
the whole run and he was hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He completely turned his whole veg into,
you know, flour at that point and just had
[SPEAKER_00]: more and quicker turnarounds than he'd
ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do it right, if you,
if you figure out kind of the recipe to
[SPEAKER_00]: success for you and it's different for
everybody, there's a hundred ways to skin
[SPEAKER_00]: a cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he followed, I mean, it was basically
like my grow was the super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like everything was mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my genetics, the super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, he just never looked back,
turned his whole grow into auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never had complaints from people that,
you know, the, the quality decreased or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more profitable for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he did pay a little bit
more in power bills running 18 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: flight, I suppose to 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, it made up for it in
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think it is definitely,
definitely a kind of the future of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's weird for me to say that up
and other people say it, but now sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: here thinking about it, it's like,
there is a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo periods will never go away,
nor should they, nor would I ever advocate
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I love photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want anybody to think I'm like
some auto flower purists because I love it
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But autos are here to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's kind of the long and
short of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen grows out in Oregon outdoors,
auto flowers that were just monsters,
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful, beautiful fields of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's, it's, it's a special
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you, when you learn it,
when you figure out how to maximise it,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, it's, it's hard to go back to
photo periods.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that story.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've referenced a few times,
you know, if people want to give this a
[SPEAKER_04]: go, you probably will stunt them a few
times, but you'll get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for anyone who might be curious and
thinking about giving it a go,
[SPEAKER_04]: what are some of those mistakes people
often make that may lead to it not going
[SPEAKER_04]: so right the first few times?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much just what I mentioned before,
just having two compact of soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatering or under watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've really got to be there kind of on a
daily basis, lifting up the pots and
[SPEAKER_00]: checking to make sure you know,
how are these guys well, nowadays,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can, you know, put a moisture meter in
there, you can use auto pots or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of just completely changed
the whole game for auto flowers with kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of the evolution of grow technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's much easier these days to get into
it and not stun it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also way more resources available
and way more people that have fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see where they've messed up in
the past that now moving forward,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can avoid their mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, it's just, I would say the
medium is the number one thing of just not
[SPEAKER_00]: having too dense of soil or medium in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think as each generation moves,
you know, from a new photo back to auto
[SPEAKER_00]: back to photo back to auto, they do gain a
little bit more resilience and tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: really just be a little bit hard year
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nowadays, all those aren't the same as
they were 10, 15 years ago, even five
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, it's just it's it's a constant
evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's only getting better with
with the right selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as I mentioned before, it's it's
not not terribly hard at all to mess up
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, go back to some ruderalis
looking stuff, but with with good
[SPEAKER_00]: selections, and then good, good pro set
good kind of skill set and knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: beforehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's way easier to be successful
with them now than ever before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can tell we've made there's been a big
leap and we'll jump into that in just one
[SPEAKER_04]: second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I forgot I hadn't actually asked
you at the start, how rude of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you been smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: The PIF S2 and the pineapple PIF and I
just just ran out of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got some honey banana here next to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some strawberry milk and cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those have been the main ones here
recently that have been in my rotation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some some beautiful examples in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've mentioned you've been fond of and
you're doing some work with the PIF.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you had a chance to try any of the
other infamous NL5 Haze clones,
[SPEAKER_04]: like maybe the C5 or the A5?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I wish I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got quite a collection of seeds made
with those, but I haven't ran them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure like you, we probably have way
more seeds than we could ever actually
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like I'm a seed hoarder collector.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, oh, let's see, one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven,
eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got about 16 totes behind me with
with seeds in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got, yeah, just my my life
investment is in seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, I have not ever experienced
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the PIF I never got to experience
until the past, let's say 18 months or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first, I was like, this is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more I smoked with it,
the more it really, really kind of got to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this particular S2 number three,
I think has something like 7% THCV,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I've never had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's something I'm really excited
to like work into auto format.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I can't get enough of the hazy
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to PIFCON this this past year,
and that was, oh, man, that was a hell of
[SPEAKER_00]: an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blew me away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had expectations for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was far above and beyond anything I
could have ever imagined.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Pifcoast Farms for putting
that on and making the PIF accessible to
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because growing up, it was just something
I'd hear about in rap songs that I never,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, thought I'd actually try.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost became like, is this even,
is this just a nickname, like KindBud?
[SPEAKER_00]: But to actually have it and be able to
like smoke it on a semi-regular basis now
[SPEAKER_00]: is, yeah, it's maybe because of the
sentimental reasons of like growing up and
[SPEAKER_00]: not having access to it and hearing so
much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's interesting?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been lucky enough to try the C5 and
the A5, but I've never tried the PIF.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go on opposite ends of the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I definitely have recently been
thinking, you know, shout out to Pifcoast
[SPEAKER_04]: Farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's undeniable that Pifcon has been a
success.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, the fact that they're going
even harder is a sign of how successful
[SPEAKER_04]: the prior ones are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably have to get those guys on
pretty soon, I reckon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me also just say shout out to Lobster
Fam Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best growers I've ever had the
pleasure of smoking his flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does stuff with that plant that's just
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PIF from him, the Harlem River Haze,
the Pineapple Pif, they are just
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel lucky to be in the same state
as him, to be completely honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a special cat for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shout out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's always lovely to be gifted
some beautiful herb.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gotten so sidetracked.
[SPEAKER_04]: I best get us back on to our story,
which is, what was your first auto breed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it intentional?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it accidental?
[SPEAKER_04]: Lay the landscape for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was intentional.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first auto to auto stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I didn't even start out with
auto to auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first auto breeding project was what
would become Sour Stamford for Mephisto
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was their Sour Crack that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2014, I moved my little cousin out
to Denver, Colorado and sampled probably
[SPEAKER_00]: 250 different strains of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got there on the day that rec stores
legally opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of this famous Anderson
Cooper.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a news anchor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a news anchor over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what he's doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he sent one of his reporters out to
Denver to cover the opening of these pot
[SPEAKER_00]: shops is what they called them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she went on this like cannabis bus
tour from dispensary to dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the first place they stopped at me
and my cousin were in line to get flour
[SPEAKER_00]: from so me and my little cousin are
standing there like you can see the video
[SPEAKER_00]: online of us like in line waiting to get
weed here as they're doing the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyways, this went viral because she
ended up getting high, like and doing her
[SPEAKER_00]: news report super, super laughy and
chatty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see in her face.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was just so and like, even Anderson
Cooper called her out on it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you sure you didn't buy it at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so during that time,
Grape Stamford was like my favorite of
[SPEAKER_00]: these like two hundred 250 strains that
that we tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: So immediately when I got back to the East
Coast, I started trying to source those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and they were just sold out
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found there's a website called can
is on out of the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a pack of Grape Stamford OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was their last pack they had of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had them send it stealth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came to me and it was a 10 seed
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up getting like 12 or 13 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I reached out like, man, are you sure
you sent me the right seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's too many seeds in here like
just super suspicious of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like who would get extra seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kept a mail from that in Maryland
as I was growing down in South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my buddy from high school kind of
take over my garden there in Maryland.
[SPEAKER_00]: He didn't even have a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: His mom would drive him to this spot that
I had and he would water the plants on a
[SPEAKER_00]: daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would drive 12 hours one way each
weekend to go up and take pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants and make sure everything was
going all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, there was a Grape Stamford
mail that I didn't know much about
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd done a lot of research and you know,
it had tacky stems and you just rub it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you could smell the grape even when it was
in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, this is like there's
something special with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kept that mail alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, down in South Carolina,
I had the Sour Crack growing a Tyrone
[SPEAKER_00]: Stamford and some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was out for my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually would take my dog on the road
with me every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: This day I left her home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was renting a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dog was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a note on the door saying,
you know, this property is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: inspected by the sheriffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This house was foreclosed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was paying my landlord.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't paying the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the house I was in went into
foreclosure without me being any wiser
[SPEAKER_00]: about the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I immediately took those two plants,
throw them in the back of a truck,
[SPEAKER_00]: drove up to Maryland with them,
had them there and was like, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this Grape Stamford mail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should like do something with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put the pollen on both the Tyrone
Special and the Sour Crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those became Sour Stamford and Tyrone
Stamford, which were the first photo to
[SPEAKER_00]: autos, the first ever breeding stuff that
I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And still to this day, it's some of my
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really truly the Grape Stamford
in auto format.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both phenomenal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was my first interaction
with breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there I was hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was off to the races.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then so how did it unfold from there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you, how did you get hooked up with
the Mephisto guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd been following them online and
their stuff was like the first stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, damn, this is a game changer for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like the next level autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we became friends on autoflower
.net.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd followed them on Mitch on there and on
ICMAG and was just a big fan of everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that he was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, you could tell he was doing it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was doing the proper selections and
running numbers and doing real true
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding work to make this plant better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really spoke to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started growing all their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would document the shit out of it
because that was, I was like super OCD
[SPEAKER_00]: about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get the VPNs and like run all my
pictures through Imgur to erase all the
[SPEAKER_00]: exit data and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just became like friends that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I asked him, before I did the
pollination, like, do you mind if I do
[SPEAKER_00]: this or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sent him the F1 seeds and he grew
them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, dude, these are like the
frostiest plants we've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he, I was like, that's my gift to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time I was trying to get a license
to grow in Maryland because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: about to go legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had him write me a nice little kind
of recommendation review thing that I
[SPEAKER_00]: could give to potential employers,
people that got licenses that like put me
[SPEAKER_00]: in a good light and said, you know,
this dude knows what he's doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in a professional professional way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, they, they continued to work
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went over there and to Spain in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when we were running the F3s
and helped do the pollinations on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually just found my, my old Imgur
account recently within the past six or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight months with all the pictures from
Spain, where I was there like helping with
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollinations and doing all the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was literally sleeping on the floor of
their like farmhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Helping, helping the, to grow there for
three months and move these projects
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became the first artisanal Mephisto
release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was, I just, I fell in love
with every aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitch had reached out a couple of times
because he was like, yeah, we got you over
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we like get you to be a part of
this, you know, make this all work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't have anyone to watch my dog
at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was engaged and my girlfriend,
my fiance at the time did not shoot her.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: She didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up moving in with her in West
Virginia and not to go on a tangent here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but one time we had some drama with the
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good old boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it in like me, I was the new
newcomer, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, fights happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cops got involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was harvesting downstairs at my,
my ex fiance's place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a knock on the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I should say the night before
there was an incident with some guns
[SPEAKER_00]: involved, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cops came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, look, you, you, you're in a
stand your ground state, your arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little bit of a background in
competitive shooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had my concealed carry permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the, like I did it all the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, don't break the law while you're
breaking the law sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, anyway, the cops basically told
me to shoot this person the next time they
[SPEAKER_00]: came over and started shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, through all my,
my training, I was like, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: go through that emotionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know like the consequences of that on a
person to like put themselves in that
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I want to protect myself and my
family and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, next day, something happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I thought was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, I went downstairs,
started harvesting, have my headphones on
[SPEAKER_00]: as I'm harvesting, don't hear shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dogs start barking upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come upstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you open the door from the
basement, you're facing the front door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a cop with his 1911 drawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm staring down the barrel of this 45
caliber pistol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't the first time that I stared
down the barrel of a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked in the cops eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see he wasn't, he was like an
older guy, a mature guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't trigger happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw he had trigger discipline.
[SPEAKER_00]: His finger was not actually on the
trigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smell like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got weed on my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a I see out of the corner of my
eye, there's hand sanitizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, don't move, don't move.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my hands in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, sir, I was downstairs jacking
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to hit this hand sanitizer real
quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab the hand sanitizer, rub it on my
hands, try to get the resin and the weed
[SPEAKER_00]: smell off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open the door, lock it behind me so he
can't go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throws me down on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had just on my hip.
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, is this the gun that was
involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever earlier as we know that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the living room, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put me in handcuffs for me in the back of
the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a small little West Virginia
town.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the FBI was like right, right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next town over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was like six different agencies
all in our driveway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neighbors were over there and the
neighbors literally had just gotten out of
[SPEAKER_00]: jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Known criminal, but he was like friends
with the police officers so much so that
[SPEAKER_00]: the night prior it took us like four hours
to actually get a cop to come out to even
[SPEAKER_00]: like talk to us because he had called in
and told his side of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, well, you know,
there's no need for us to go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the person that they wanted to
press charges on me as I'm sitting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: back of the car, they're trying to call.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't get a hold of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two hours goes by.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not listening to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to explain my side of the story
through the back of the car window.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just fuck this kid out of town or
blah, blah, blah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, they get a hold of the dude
and the dude was like, no, he was standing
[SPEAKER_00]: his ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on his property and did nothing
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to press charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let me go give my gun back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have any keys on me to go in the
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to sit outside without a phone
and a snowy West Virginia holler for like
[SPEAKER_00]: three hours until I checked out home from
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, I was trying to call and text
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew something was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, that was like the writing on
the wall of I got to get to a legal place
[SPEAKER_00]: and a legal state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I decided, you know,
fuck this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done taking these risks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like time to go to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of how that all happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you ask?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get back to the actual question.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, that was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How you got hooked in with Mephisto?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wonder what are some of the standout
strains from that period that you really
[SPEAKER_04]: stand behind and think were just awesome?
[SPEAKER_00]: With Mephisto stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just any of that early stuff you
worked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the sour stuff early this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's an amazing strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of love and respect for
what I did with those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they they're like, some of their
stuff's been the high watermark for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the autos, especially at the time,
like the the Ripley's OG, the Walter
[SPEAKER_00]: White, a lot of their older stuff was just
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't kept up too much with any of
their their newer stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still go back and dabble in my old
Mephisto seed stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even before then, Secret Garden Seeds was
like another company that that Mitch had
[SPEAKER_00]: before Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've still got my auto stock from from
them from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I have a lot of respect and a lot
of sentimental value in those seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still love them to this day and
still still go back and check them out
[SPEAKER_00]: every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the the the Sour Sombra for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Walter White, the Ripley's.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, some some incredibly memorable
strains there that even in Australia,
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember we're getting grown out quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So shout out to all the people who got to
enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I guess at a certain point
that chapter wrapped up for you and you
[SPEAKER_04]: moved on to Nite Hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the inspiration for starting your
own project, Nite Hour?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just kind of had creative differences,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most diplomatic way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different visions for how the company
should proceed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't really want to get too deep
into it, but yeah, let's just say creative
[SPEAKER_00]: differences.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what was the first project you
worked on under the name Nite Hour,
[SPEAKER_04]: at least in your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Wizards of Prentiss, the Blue
Microverse and the Zammadelica Express
[SPEAKER_00]: were my first night L releases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I released those all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the the Blue Microverse was Blue
Magoo BX2 from Dynasty, who is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, another legend in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an absolute honor to work with his
gear and, you know, to have him comment on
[SPEAKER_00]: like photos of myself and be like,
Dan, that looks like the Blue Magoo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I don't know, it was just it
gave me the it was like the wind beneath
[SPEAKER_00]: my wings to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was doing the right thing
and going in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Wizards of Prentiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prentiss was a Cheech Wizard from Bodhi
that I worked in the auto format.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone loves Bodhi, myself included,
nothing but admiration for all he's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think he's he's an unsung hero,
especially nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like he doesn't get the reverence
he deserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, he's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an amazing, amazing cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope to one day shake his hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's he's he's a special dude for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, the Zammadelica Express,
which is the Zammadelica from AC,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's worked in the auto format.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, just the the Landry Sativa
stuff is just that's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everything I do is something that I
really want to do and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it boils down to is just
these are things that I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's a really special feeling to
bring something new into the world that
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't existed before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like artists do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chefs do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, cannabis breeders do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just it's it's a really cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thing to experience and behold.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, so many epic points in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, mad love for Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's I think he's made of pure love and
light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I agree with everything you said.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's just a pillar in the scene and
Professor P 100 percent, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: still one of the few breeders in my tier
one category.
[SPEAKER_04]: And anyone who listens to the show will
know that I love the Blue Magoo line.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for me, very biased opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think Blue Heron, Blue Magoo BX to
the best seed lines you can buy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to ask you, you know, moving on to
some of the incredible work that we see
[SPEAKER_04]: under the banner of Nite Hour,
if you couldn't know any specific details
[SPEAKER_04]: about the grower, but could only recommend
one pack of your seeds for someone,
[SPEAKER_04]: what pack would you recommend just as I
guess a general all rounder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the strawberry milk and cookies
remix, because that's the version that's
[SPEAKER_00]: currently available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a flower that will make you say,
damn, this is an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It there's it's frosty as I get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got incredible turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the most it's not the biggest
plant overall, but it's the quintessential
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower as far as, you know,
strawberry structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just overall an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would probably be my go to
recommendation for what's currently
[SPEAKER_00]: available worldwide out of my catalog for
someone that's never grown an auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what my gut's telling me to
say right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that because I was lucky enough to
try some of the original and hopefully
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be lucky enough to try some of the
remix.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was truly a beautiful strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and I guess I wanted to ask for
any breeder, there's a few strains that
[SPEAKER_04]: just really seem to hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had jotted down a few Cosmic Queen
was another one that I felt really hit
[SPEAKER_04]: with the audience, at least in terms of
what I could see and Marathon OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think it is about these
certain strains that really seem to become
[SPEAKER_04]: super popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cosmic Queen is what with a few of my
streams is like there's there's nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: else like it on on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you just don't find these flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a honeysuckle suntan lotion,
creamy, just something special that you
[SPEAKER_00]: just it catches you off guard where you're
like, What the fuck is this, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like I can't even pinpoint a
single flavor and through the cure,
[SPEAKER_00]: even the flavor will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll get cheesier and funkier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people love that they love the
resin production of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, the that one in particular is
super uplifting sativa dominant,
[SPEAKER_00]: just really amazing, nice, euphoric
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Marathon OG was like the first,
in my opinion, really true OG auto where
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like, damn, this is like super OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big yielder, super dense OG nugs,
just the the turps are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there another one you mentioned?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I also had the the milk and
cookies on the list.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's so many, but those were
just certainly some of the ones that I've
[SPEAKER_04]: seen very represented by people as grown
and loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think they catch people off guard
and and they're strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they have amazing effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have amazing flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's people don't expect that from an
auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they get it, it really resonates
with people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure, you know, you're you're
lucky enough to have that feeling quite
[SPEAKER_04]: often.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on your website now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see that the the Halloween drop with
the blue power is coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just one of the many collabs you've
done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously Sin City, super well regarded.
[SPEAKER_04]: I call them a bit of a dark horse breeders
breeder because you find their work pop up
[SPEAKER_04]: in other breeders works and it flies under
the radar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you know, in Cushmints, there's Sin
City's work in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, tell me a bit about this blue
power drop and what would you like?
[SPEAKER_04]: What sort of traits does it bring to the
table?
[SPEAKER_04]: What would people get excited for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely agree that he's kind of
another one of the unsung heroes that's
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in the work and, you know,
just doing it quietly and staying in his
[SPEAKER_00]: own lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, he's a phenomenal dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hang out with him a couple of
times, him and his wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're they're great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really hit it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had similar backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: With like skateboarding and music and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's just a super good dude overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the blue power, man, it's really
kind of a blueberry master Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just really, really nice, incredibly
resinous, hardy, heavy hitting,
[SPEAKER_00]: just overall fantastic plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got super fat, almost like
Afghanistan style leaves, super nice dark
[SPEAKER_00]: foliage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fades beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the resin has fall off it as I was
breaking up seeds of it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be such a nice, such a nice
extractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran a couple through through my little
tumbler before deseeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, they they they dumped heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm expecting good things for the
solventless guys with that one,
[SPEAKER_00]: which also, yeah, the the strawberry milk
and cookies and the remix are also both
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice washers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I've kind of tried to
start focusing on more over the past
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like, you know, that's where
the market's going as opposed to back in
[SPEAKER_00]: my heyday, getting out the glass tube and
blasting away, taking it to the back of it
[SPEAKER_00]: and purging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that whole process was like a ritual
to me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to love chopping a plant and
throwing it in the little cooler with some
[SPEAKER_00]: dry ice and freezing it up and then
packing the tube and refreezing it and
[SPEAKER_00]: going out to town just blasting away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the the solventless stuff is
really taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people have found some really good
good washers in my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my my buddies growers down in
Virginia, he swears by the strawberry milk
[SPEAKER_00]: and cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like strawberry milk, strawberry
Nesquik flavored hash and dumps.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets like six percent returns.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of his buddies in Colorado got like
eight and a half percent returns on a
[SPEAKER_00]: wizard stash remix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually just sent me up recently
being like, man, I'm really looking
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to the blue power stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the solventless stuff is just
taken off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while I'm not focused solely on that,
because I feel like there's that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a byproduct of some of the photo periods
that I'm working with naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do my part properly, that trades me
to carry over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I don't wash myself,
it's not something I've ever been like I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to breathe specifically for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is something that I do keep in mind
now during my selections.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you got me wondering, do we need to
see like a mountain tropic kind of cookies
[SPEAKER_04]: or does, you know, like it's such an
infamously famous washer that you just set
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself up for success.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I wanted to ask you, you know,
on that topic, are you much of a
[SPEAKER_04]: concentrates guy?
[SPEAKER_04]: If so, what's your preferred type of
concentrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to dab exclusively pretty much
what I mean, I went from flower to
[SPEAKER_00]: dabbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I went to Spain,
it was like an unknown thing over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I brought like a couple of rigs over
there to like give to the guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, what, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so over there, I like bought a whole
setup to blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of like changed, changed a
little bit of the game for them in some
[SPEAKER_00]: respects, because, well, I don't want to
speak out of school here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I should probably let them tell their
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that the dabbing was a huge part
of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to love glass, the glassblower
named doom glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was just one of my all time
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's kind of vanished off the face of
the earth the past few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually went on Instagram and searches
hashtag recent recently and found like the
[SPEAKER_00]: most recent post of him with somebody in
it and reached out to that was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, you know, is this dude all right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, he's just taking a
break.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I loved pho and live rosy and I
love just all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't dabble as much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my little puffco proxy pipe that
I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my my go to as far as dabbing
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the mountain trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like my favorite strain for years
and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a very I try to be as respectful
as possible with breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I reached out to the only we did some
trades and like, man, I'd love to work
[SPEAKER_00]: this trap cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like during the time that him
and Joey were like had their little kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of falling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terry Palms went his way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only went his way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only said, yeah, you know, I'll get it to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terry said, yeah, I'll get it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met up with somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like a mutual friend of theirs to
get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me the wrong cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then after I ran that, it was the wrong
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached back out to both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point, they were like had
nothing to do with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told both of them out of respect
that I reached out to both of them hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it from one of them to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I think that pissed off both of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of shot myself in the foot there
being like too respectful or cautious or
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of like pushed them both away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've ran into Harry Palms since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my man, like I'd love to work
something still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for a while they both kind of went
their separate ways from the trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it seems like they're kind of
starting to come back around to the trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was one of my favorite
trades for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really kind of got bummed out that I
didn't work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still something I'd love to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some I believe there's some
other trap autos out there that I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: tried just because I kind of stick to my
own stuff just to for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'd love to work with that one
still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny that you bring that up
because I still to this day would love to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had some trap cherry just the
other night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went down to New York and met up with
some people and had some trap cherry
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I forgot how much I love this fucking
trap a can of cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get this back in my life.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is this is why I'm the best people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got that six cent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know the backstory.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, like I said, I've been a fan of
yours on the podcast is the very first
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been my best friend in the garden
many lonely nights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was I was just having a joke there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's very that's very lovely to hear
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what, when you were talking
earlier about trimming the weed when the
[SPEAKER_04]: cop broke down your door, I was going to
say, I hope you weren't listening to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to be associated with trauma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I don't have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was listening to a show called Ron and
Fez at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I remember specifically what I
was listening to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're in the clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: See what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I knew I knew you would have remembered.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, no, look, we've had a friendship for
a number of years and it's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm so glad we're finally doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, you know, while we're talking
about you were saying there's some other
[SPEAKER_04]: trap autos out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like a lot of the bulk sort of
cheaper, largely speaking, just as a
[SPEAKER_04]: general rule of thumb, what you might call
sort of European originated auto seed,
[SPEAKER_04]: probably mostly from Spain.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of it is obviously nowhere near the
level of night out of Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess a lot of those former negative
a lot of those things you hear about autos
[SPEAKER_04]: that were related to the European stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that's just an artifact of
the fact that like some of those initial
[SPEAKER_04]: breedings were not done that well and it's
just carried over ever since?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, is that just a rational explanation
or do you think like it's more complex
[SPEAKER_04]: than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the game's changed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those bulk breeders have seen what
the good autos are and now buy those seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and knock those off so that they do have
bulk stuff that's like much better than it
[SPEAKER_00]: used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, any bulk
anything is never going to be good as
[SPEAKER_00]: something boutique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually has some intention
behind it as far as the selections are
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's kind of the problem with I
have someone reach out to me every other
[SPEAKER_00]: month saying, hey, got a million seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you want to, you know, buy some of
these, we front them to you, you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell them, put your name on it,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, never know why would I
ever that's there's so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a personal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a personal relationship with
this plant and the selection, like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, is so much defined by the palette
of a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to see these, excuse me, these huge
auto farms, these outdoor farms where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're reversing a thousand plants and
pollinating five thousand plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting however many millions of seeds and
then combining them all into one seed
[SPEAKER_00]: stock is just crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's always going to be a
market for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these people spend their money on
promotion rather than actually doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always going to be a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be a new company
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be people doing
white labeling stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's part of the industry at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a difference between, you know,
again, the intentional pollination and
[SPEAKER_00]: selection and having a discriminating
palette versus we're just trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: as many seeds as possible for as cheap as
possible to sell them for as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I don't know, my buddy was down in a
hydro shop in D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: sent me a picture the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, for every excuse me,
for every hundred dollars you spend,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get to stick your hand in a box and
grab a random pack of seeds or three
[SPEAKER_00]: random packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was and the seeds he pulled out were
auto companies that you and I both know
[SPEAKER_00]: very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just amazing to me to see what
kind of level it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to Sin City about this
earlier tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's a race to the bottom with
autos these days because the sharks have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen what what good auto flowers do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the the auto flower community has been
like the bastard stepchild of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: scene its entire existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never been given any respect or
any credit or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always like you mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they're for beginners and only,
you know, beginners grow these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's even to the point where they're
like the hate for it is so strong that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of alienated us into our own
little community that's almost separate
[SPEAKER_00]: from the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the auto flower community and
the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people see that and they want in on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's just it's they're like,
well, let's take the best seeds that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can buy and reproduce them and mass
without a care for anything other than
[SPEAKER_00]: just the quantity of the seeds at the end
of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get some cool packaging to put them
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's name them something catchy and let's
just sell them for as cheap as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see the some of these companies and
the amount of seeds they give out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you buy a pack of seeds for 40 bucks and
end up getting, you know, 15, 20 seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just tell that's a white label
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like that's all bought stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way you can't afford the
overhead of an actual true like breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: With autos, they just don't yield the same
amount of seeds that a photo period does.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing selections, you're not
pollinating every single thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you are pollinating every single
thing, you're testing the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: afterward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're smoking the seeded bud to figure
out what's what what's the best and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these companies just release
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put it all into one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, there's so much, you know,
typical variation in some strains and in
[SPEAKER_00]: some generations in particular,
if you just combine them all together and
[SPEAKER_00]: call it one thing, it's it's it's
impossible to recreate or to really do
[SPEAKER_00]: that because there's no you can have in a
pack of five seeds, five different
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, it's just it's a
different way of doing things than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will always be a market for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it seems to be a race to the
bottom right now in the auto flower world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it almost reminds me of kind of like
the big multistate operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the dispensary world, coming in,
selling stuff at a loss to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_00]: local competition who's actually putting
in the work, has the heart and the soul
[SPEAKER_00]: and the passion and are putting out the
good product, but have to charge more for
[SPEAKER_00]: it because, you know, they just have that
higher overhead and don't have this
[SPEAKER_00]: reserve of money that they're just sitting
on to get rid of the rest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: competition, which that's kind of where
we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the auto world is just the the big
bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the the chads or whatever you want to
refer to them as are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them are very deceptive in
their marketing to make it seem like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're able to, like I said,
kind of see the marketing schemes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that they're doing things and just the
sheer volume of seeds that they can afford
[SPEAKER_00]: to give away, it's just a completely
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's not what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll never be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, just it's it hurts my soul a
little bit to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also makes me happy that it's
bringing new people into the auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: world, because once they get hooked,
then they do their research and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: find night owl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, wow, I wish I knew about
this sooner, but I'm glad I'm here now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's such an interesting perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to admit, I feel quite enlightened
to hear all of that, because as you said,
[SPEAKER_04]: there is a bit of a subdivision in it and
it can at times feel a bit like grow of us
[SPEAKER_04]: auto flower grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you say all of those points,
all of them resonate, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can completely appreciate all of what
you said.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to be honest, I think there's honestly
a bit of a race to the bottom in even in
[SPEAKER_04]: photo periods, you know, like all power to
him.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was just a few weeks ago,
we saw Top Dog post about I'm getting back
[SPEAKER_04]: to a day job because things are changing
and credit to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was other many other breeders in
the comments who shared that same
[SPEAKER_04]: sentiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I know Skunk BA used to be
working as an electrician for many years
[SPEAKER_04]: because he was like, you know,
why not?
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to to sort of pivot for a second
and ask you, I think your Instagram
[SPEAKER_04]: account has to be one of the most faked
ones out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's a few people I think Cap
is another guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like you, you are definitely in the
contention up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think I like to pride myself
on never following the fake account
[SPEAKER_04]: because, you know, it gives social vouch
and other people follow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like to think I'm a good enough
little Instagram detective that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, one time I got caught out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be honest, one time I got caught out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I followed the fake one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to know from your point of
view, what's it been like to have so many
[SPEAKER_04]: people like because it seems like I have
to assume that these scammers are getting
[SPEAKER_04]: sales because that's why they keep doing
you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flattering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I'm one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I live with myself every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see myself as anything
particularly special.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just doing the work that I want to be
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to see other people that are copying
and completely taking my profile and
[SPEAKER_00]: making it their own and doing tricky stuff
with like, you know, using a capital I to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it look like an L or using a period
in the wrong place or whatever like they
[SPEAKER_00]: fooled me before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, is this my account?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I tagged the wrong account before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, don't feel bad about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a tricky thing to navigate and
to have someone come to you and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, I just sent this dude money through
PayPal friends and family and like don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have anything to show for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that's a tough position to be
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always, you know, say, you know,
send me the screenshots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, sorry that happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is just kind of one of the evils of
Instagram these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to to post about, you know,
any time I see one and it's weird now with
[SPEAKER_00]: like the invite collaborator post on
Instagram, I'll invite my three other
[SPEAKER_00]: accounts, I've got four accounts and I'll
invite them all so that people can see
[SPEAKER_00]: these are like the accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even still within those, the scammers
will comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some reason, a lot of times I
don't see them whether I only have them
[SPEAKER_00]: blocked on one of the four accounts or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they fly under my radar and people will
be like responding even recently somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, the chem dog was commenting to
somebody about like, dude, that's a fake
[SPEAKER_00]: account.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got his first fake account after
our collab together where they were like
[SPEAKER_00]: pretending to be chem dog glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, man, this is like,
this is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never experienced this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you must be doing something right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that that's tricky to deal with
and tricky to navigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I try to steer people right and try to
post fairly frequently the fakes as they
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just that's one of the evils of
dealing with that platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's I feel like it's actually becoming
worse more recently.
[SPEAKER_04]: But hey, you named the magic word chem dog
focal theme in the show overall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure a strain, a man, a family of
strains that near and dear to both of our
[SPEAKER_04]: hearts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell us a little bit about this collab.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know people are excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel the listeners will like definitely
ask about the chem dog collab and tell us
[SPEAKER_04]: a little bit about the chem dog and as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that was special to me that dude,
I have so much respect and love for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, really, that was something
special for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a project I've been working on
since 2018 or 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him first in like 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I commissioned a little money from
him and then a hammer and some other
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's just it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time I met him, James Bean
introduced him to me using my real name
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than Dez.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I'd see him after that,
he'd be like, Hey, and say my real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like so special to me that this
person can fucking chem dog, dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: like those my real name enough so to
remember it year after year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it was just it was crazy,
Jimmy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he like, I don't know, his whole story
was very touching to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that he's like a stand up dude,
and you know, did the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's it's just I said
there's a difference because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always been kind of my catchphrase
with with night owl and what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like he's like that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a lot of similarities as far as,
you know, starting young and trying to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a good steward for the plant and to keep
things alive and moving and knowing when
[SPEAKER_00]: we have something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, man, he's just a really,
really good dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I made the I worked the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for three years, I was like,
dude, we should like collab on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to like collab on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just the timing never worked out and
be like, yeah, like, well, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He never shit on the idea was like always
positive about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never had a bad thing to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just the timing never worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, you got a job in the legal
industry has a grow out in Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_00]: for a dispensary out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really started to take up a lot
of his time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seeds are ready well over a year
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, I had him up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, man, I'd so love to do that
collab thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole time I was like,
I want to I want to do something special
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to, like, be a historic thing,
you know, at least in the Canada world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this was fucking chem dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, like this is the man, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in twenty nineteen, I think it was I
saw his collab with swamp white seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I have them right here in front
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did the dogways collab with swamp white
seeds and they did vials of the seeds came
[SPEAKER_00]: in numbered from one to one hundred of
that number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty one out of one hundred right here in
front of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, I don't even want to open
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to break the seal on these
because it's such like a special,
[SPEAKER_00]: cool, sentimental pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I always had the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved his bunnies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've always been like my go to piece
ever since I started smoking chillums and
[SPEAKER_00]: little wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were always my go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Numbered one is for a collab drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be so fucking dope to have some
night owl.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is and I'm not like I never knew the
business side of glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never knew just how incredibly expensive
it is to have custom millies made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it was like mind blowing the
amount of money I spent on these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I charge five dollars more than I
actually paid for them to be made,
[SPEAKER_00]: which didn't even cover the credit card
processing fee for the actual pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like it was definitely like a labor
of love type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, I am so honored and so proud and
so stoked that we got these one is done
[SPEAKER_00]: with the night owl millies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two be reactive millies in it and
one regular night owl millie and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem dog millie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just fucking gorgeous,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one that I sent out,
I didn't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I wanted to keep all one
hundred for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're all so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each time I see one posted,
I remember packing it up and like the
[SPEAKER_00]: specific details of that individual one
that really stood out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime I see one post, I'm like,
this one was one of my favorites because
[SPEAKER_00]: of this or this one was one of my
favorites because of this feature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it was like years and years in
the making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to have it all finally come to
fruition the way that it did was just
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, not to speak out of school,
but it was out of time and kind of dog's
[SPEAKER_00]: life where his father was sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rest in peace, his father did just
pass away recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it also really helped kind of
with some stuff that he had going on to
[SPEAKER_00]: financially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was such an honor for me to be able
to pay back something to this man who's
[SPEAKER_00]: given so much to the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also released some cap 91 reg autos,
which nobody really releases reg autos
[SPEAKER_00]: because I feel like, oh, that's giving
away intellectual property or you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to spawn a hundred different
companies that are all making seeds from
[SPEAKER_00]: these auto rights, which it did spawn
some, but so be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted that out there the way the 10 91
made an impact on the photo period side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted these auto rights to make that
same impact in these same waves on the
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it did exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it was like a just an amazing,
an amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, a milestone and a historic
piece of cannabis history here and truly
[SPEAKER_00]: an honor to be able to work with this man
who I've looked up to for so long and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, nothing but love and respect to
that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he may be getting into the,
I know he's been making some seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: testing some seeds out of his own soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully we see some chem dog releases
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told him, you know, any,
any help you need with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: He reached out to me to ask about like,
you know, packages and everything and
[SPEAKER_00]: stickers and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he told me he'd never been a part of
any genetic draft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the one that we did, he was like,
that was so special and so unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, they sold out within minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gone now.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the oneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, we didn't even know how the oneys would
sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, is this too much to charge for
a pipe?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just charge exactly or $5 more than
what I paid for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, is that going to be too much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it ended up being 225 bucks for
the pipes ended up costing me like 220
[SPEAKER_00]: with the, I did like some custom
packaging, some really, really nice boxes
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did some pins, a key chain,
all sorts of stickers and just extra
[SPEAKER_00]: goodies to go along with it and make it
really memorable and special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it worked out phenomenally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought initially maybe we'd sell like
25, even though I'd commissioned a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: total.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, he made 40 the first batch and I
was like, that should be plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're going to sell 40 of
them, but yeah, they sold out almost
[SPEAKER_00]: instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was like, well, fuck,
I guess I have to go back and make the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like another week.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made another 40 and then the next week
he made the finals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, people were kind of pissed
that they had to wait for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I didn't expect this to blow up
like it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I knew in my heart how huge this was,
but I didn't know other people would
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to it the same way that I was
feeling about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to see that, I think it really was
heartwarming to him as much as it was to
[SPEAKER_00]: me to like get out there to a completely
new audience and like really keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: legend of this beautiful person alive and
this beautiful strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, man, I was, I am so stoked and
honored to have done that, to have done it
[SPEAKER_00]: justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did that really truly proper.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's so epic to hear.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I echo all those
sentiments, you know, Greg, and just,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think his wife as well, you know,
they do so much for the scene and very,
[SPEAKER_04]: very much unsung heroes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's so exciting to hear that there
might be some seeds from him on the
[SPEAKER_04]: horizon and that you were able to do this
really fulfilling and cool project with
[SPEAKER_04]: him.
[SPEAKER_04]: In amongst that, you referenced dropping
the photo period auto hybrids with the
[SPEAKER_04]: Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to ask about that because,
I mean, I guess you sort of answered it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'd love to get a bit more thoughts
about, do you think the fact that there
[SPEAKER_04]: are so few auto companies on the market,
relatively speaking, is a reflection of
[SPEAKER_04]: the fact that people are a bit guarded
about releasing the regular stock as it is
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of IP.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and I guess as an extrapolation of
that, do you think that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like it's okay to give it out because the
real skills sort of in the breeding
[SPEAKER_04]: anyway, it's not just in the base stock or
what's your thoughts overall on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that I'm afraid to see after all
the work that I've put in, the auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool get bottlenecked from people,
you know, reversing the same shit onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: same shit over and over again,
especially with all the block stuff going
[SPEAKER_00]: on right now and the fake name game,
the renaming stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've released the wizard's apprentice as
auto regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've released the Zomaldelica express as
auto regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've released the blue micro versus auto
regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a few more than Zomaldelica to
marathon auto regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to put a platform out there for
other people that really want to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: work and do it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to give them the absolute best
footing possible and the foundation to
[SPEAKER_00]: move forward in the best light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really kind of like an
altruistic type thing of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this to be carried on and who
knows, who knows how long any of us have
[SPEAKER_00]: on this earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this stuff isn't out there,
if it's blocked and guarded, like if I
[SPEAKER_00]: pass away, what's going to happen to my
seed stock?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I've got so much here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't get it out and don't allow
others to work with it, what good is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that's kind of, that was kind
of the motivation for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also just people were gatekeeping
autos for a long, long time and weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out auto regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even still there's like no auto regs
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and honestly, there's really not a
market for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they, they, most people that get
autos want to grow them, don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they're harder to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they take longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very dedicated and time,
space and energy consuming process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to put these out there for the people
that actually want to do it right,
[SPEAKER_00]: felt like the right move to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of people told me I'm
shoot myself in the foot by doing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this, that, and the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, it's also
palette driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's, I'm super
fortunate that somehow I've gained a very
[SPEAKER_00]: loyal following.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'm not a person that like
toots my own horn or have ever been good
[SPEAKER_00]: about talking about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people talk way better about me than
I can ever talk about myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the way it's always been.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact that people are loyal and do
want that and want to work at their own
[SPEAKER_00]: ways is like, it's an honor to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's just a weird thing where it's
like, I don't know, sometimes I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: really good about what I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I'm like, did I just like
completely fuck up myself from a business
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint?
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, I can't worry
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, like I said, there's so many
new projects to, to constantly work on
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's hard for me to even do the
reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to put this stuff out there for other
people to do just so it carries on one way
[SPEAKER_00]: or the other in some format is better than
it not being available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, we hear this sentiment
shared in the context of clones all the
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, it's all well and good to sit
on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if something happens to you,
it's just, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, it's almost better to
just give it out there just for the
[SPEAKER_04]: purposes of keeping it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then, as you said, there's also just a
lot of good intention and a sense of
[SPEAKER_04]: collegiality in sharing it and saying,
you know, I'm not looking to hamstring
[SPEAKER_04]: anyone who wants to give it a go
themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to ask you, you know,
you spoke about how you let your work and
[SPEAKER_04]: let others speak about you more than
yourself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think looking at the sheer number of
collaborations you've had all just,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, sort of really big hitter names
in the mix there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything fun on the horizon you
might want to give people a sneak peek
[SPEAKER_04]: into?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or even just more generally, any strains
on the horizon you are sort of locked into
[SPEAKER_04]: working with that you might slip out?
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as stuff that I want to share,
I've pretty much said most of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The PIF, the Banana OG, obviously the Blue
Power, the AJ Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with Top Dog to do a Stardog
auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of fucked that up and lost the
clone, got it back from him, lost it
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it back from him, lost it again,
bought it from somebody else, lost it
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really have like fucked that one up
royally and I feel so much shame about
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, life happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get it back again and I'll make
it right and we'll do it, do it the
[SPEAKER_00]: justice it deserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, those are pretty much the ones
as of now that I want to share and keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest under wraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found that if I give too much away or
if I'm working on a certain strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of a sudden another breeder will have
it on the market six months later,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, you know, unless they happen to
have that same mindset, we're doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: work, which these people that all of a
sudden come out are the name game people
[SPEAKER_00]: that just will slap whatever name sells on
something that it's like, I just keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: to myself at this point until I'm like
almost ready to release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, those are the ones that I'm
comfortable kind of talking about now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I think you mentioned just a variety
of strains there, which is just a plethora
[SPEAKER_04]: to get excited about.
[SPEAKER_04]: No need to feel bad about not dropping any
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was about four or five hitters in
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to ask a few of the fans submitted
questions we got from the Patreon,
[SPEAKER_04]: but before I do a few last ones from me,
which was just as a sort of general
[SPEAKER_04]: question, not that I'm like, you know,
thinking of any project.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there one project of yours that you
think to yourself, you know what,
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could go back to that one,
either because it's just so good you want
[SPEAKER_04]: to continue it or because maybe you think
you might've been able to do it better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anything jump to mind when I say
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Tyrone Stomper at F7 started
to get a little, the bud structure became
[SPEAKER_00]: looser and isn't quite what it was before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one that I would like to go
back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still hybridizes incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still crosses out beautifully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the hybrids from it are amazing,
but in its pure form, I think I lost
[SPEAKER_00]: something just in the structure alone,
but also at the same time, it's frostier
[SPEAKER_00]: now than it's ever been.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the main stalk has trichomes on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the fan leaves everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just completely, it looks insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's some sort of mutation happened
to where the bud structure lost its
[SPEAKER_00]: density a bit, but it gained all sorts of
resin everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like this crazy, just little free
plant of pure resin that is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, it crosses out well
still, but that's one that I would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: go back and kind of lock back down on its
own so that it can be released,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, nice and pure again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I mean, that's the only one that
I'm kind of hard on myself about to be
[SPEAKER_00]: honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that one's pretty fair to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, it also sounds like it's,
it hasn't deteriorated.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just sort of diverged a bit from the
original, but it's got all those
[SPEAKER_04]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a bit of a tongue in cheek one,
I want to know, will we ever see any photo
[SPEAKER_04]: period from you?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's funny you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did do a release of early bird fast
photos to go along with night owls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a, from seed to stone,
this YouTube channel, it's like massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a huge discord and he did a
strawberry milk and cookies remix grow off
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for his Patreon members, I released
for the first time ever, just gifted them
[SPEAKER_00]: out just to see them grown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A cross called majestic tie, which was an
old type of cross to wizard's apprentice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like my first ever photo
period cross that I had released or photo
[SPEAKER_00]: to auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole concept was like early bird
fast finishing photo periods to go along
[SPEAKER_00]: with the night owl auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I've got hundreds and hundreds
of photo period crosses that I've made
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years, just photo to photo
straight up just for preservation sake and
[SPEAKER_00]: just for my own to dig into later and see
what I can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do feel there's some merit to
staying in my own lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do feel there's merit to remaining loyal
to the people that have remained loyal to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, there's just
not enough space and time for me to do
[SPEAKER_00]: both, at least not to the level that I
want to be doing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so autos are my favorite thing to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they keep me on my toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how they keep me involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, if you couldn't tell from the
conversation so far, some ADHD issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the autos and their constant changing
and their speed and everything just,
[SPEAKER_00]: just, I don't know, it, it keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps my interest from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really where my, my heart,
my passion is that, but I wouldn't mind
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing some of the photo periods,
stuff that I've made just to get it out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause again, that's stuff like with the
space dog clone, that's no longer in
[SPEAKER_00]: existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I crossed that to the blue goo BX to
across the two space dog seed stock,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I went through a bunch of packs of
the space dog seed stock to find the same
[SPEAKER_00]: clone before the people that had the clone
allowed me access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was nothing like this clone in
the seed stock and come to find out later,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there was a mix up with,
with some cool at one point in his mails
[SPEAKER_00]: where, you know, the space dude wasn't the
space dude anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the seeds that I had weren't the
same seed stock from previous,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though they were labeled and sold as
such.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's, there's stuff like that,
that even the, the great stopper,
[SPEAKER_00]: OG, some Aloha white widow stuff that I
like, I crossed the flu Magoo and the
space dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: See stock and a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'd love to get it out there at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it's older, maybe, you know,
eight to 10 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've made more recent photo crosses
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I don't know, man, I don't want
to step on anybody's toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays you see more and more photo
people coming into the auto world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, all right, well,
if there is this crossover, maybe I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do try to like people that I look up
to and respect and, and, and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to give them the proper guidance to
do it right as far as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: stepping in and like the, I was talking to
Sin City earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, dude, you've got an amazing
foundation now to like use this blue power
[SPEAKER_00]: auto against all your other stuff and do
your own auto flower line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, man, I was thinking the
same thing, but kind of, he has that same
[SPEAKER_00]: mentality of not wanting to step on any
toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I was going to ask you
about that and ask for your guidance with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, I'd love to,
to help in any way I can because I'm never
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have the time and space to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do all that anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stuff is phenomenal and should be
made into auto flower format.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to, to help on that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as doing it, who knows,
maybe one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: You, you should do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I'd encourage you to, but it's
interesting because you, you sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: alluded to this point that I like,
which is that there is sort of this
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting stigma of, you know,
anyone who photo breeds that they'll make
[SPEAKER_04]: an auto.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one bats an eye, but to do it the other
way, it's a little bit more of a gap to
[SPEAKER_04]: jump, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_04]: So that, that is interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the final question from me,
before we jump into some of the Patreon
[SPEAKER_04]: ones, it's a doozy, but it's the one I
wanted to know probably the most.
[SPEAKER_04]: Explain to me, how do I convert my
favorite photo period clone into an auto?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take your photo period clone and
you get some auto regs, or if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: proficient in reversing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find a auto female that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, reverse the photo onto the
auto or the auto onto the photo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or again, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for the, the Sour Stomper,
I used a photo period male onto a female
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can do it either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in the selection once again,
but you get that F1 generation of photo to
[SPEAKER_00]: auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all going to be 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the time photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take those, you find the male and the
female that have the traits of the photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cross those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get the F2 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where you need to run the big
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 25% give or take of that F2 generation
will be autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously if it's a regular seed
stock, half are going to be male and half
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you run enough that you'll have a good
selection of that 25% of autos to pick out
[SPEAKER_00]: an auto male with the photo period traits
that you're looking for and an auto female
[SPEAKER_00]: with the photo period traits that you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you cross those two autos for fully
auto F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, it's a matter of
whether you want to refine the line more,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you want to feminize at that
point, whatever you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way, and I've just just started
to dabble in this way of doing it is
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to work the entire project feminize
so that it's that much easier that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to do a multiple male selection
at any given stage at any generation where
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't necessarily know what the male
is going to provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing it all a feminized stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potentially, I haven't done this yet,
but this is my next trial and error thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to do is making F1 feminized photo to
autos, growing those out, picking the
[SPEAKER_00]: single best female out of those that
resembles that clone only, selfing that
[SPEAKER_00]: one for the F2 generation to try to lock
in those photo traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the F2 generation,
picking out the one or two best female
[SPEAKER_00]: autos and selfing or cross-pollinating
those and just doing the whole project
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized so that way it takes a lot of
the guesswork out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, again, I haven't done this yet,
but I have set myself up to do this now
[SPEAKER_00]: with some new feminized photo to auto
process that I'm looking forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: trying.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's brilliant and very comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was sort of in my mind following each
step and it sounds like, as you said,
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot more involved than regular breeding,
but very doable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just probably takes a lot of time,
patience and skill.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess my question then is on that last
step, right, where you say you've got the
[SPEAKER_04]: F3 and most of the time people release
feminized auto flower seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm guessing you pop those seeds and
you pick one of the females and you
[SPEAKER_04]: reverse it onto the others and that's the
stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any way of which you can improve
your select?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm assuming in an ideal world,
you're going to reverse one of the better
[SPEAKER_04]: females, but it's not like a photo period
where you get to know which ones are the
[SPEAKER_04]: better ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it just like the good female would
be the pollen donor if it's not the pollen
[SPEAKER_04]: provider or pollen recipient?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is there any difference in that
situation, have you found?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where photo period readers have it
so easy because they can keep clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't want to toot my own horn or
anything, but if I was to enter the photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period world, I do think I could run
circles around some of the current
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders that are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you might want to cut that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an asshole for even thinking that,
but anyway, I always reverse way more
[SPEAKER_00]: plants than I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always pollinate way more plants than I
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it really comes down to after
those are harvested, smoking each one and
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out which seed stock from those
to actually work with moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I was saying, some of the bulk
guys will just mix them all together and
[SPEAKER_00]: call it one individual strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas I will only take one of those
plants and move forward with that seed
[SPEAKER_00]: stock to the next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't know until you actually
smoke it because the effects actually
[SPEAKER_00]: matters, not just, well, this one's really
pretty, so we're moving forward with this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way deeper than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always do way more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always tossing out way more plants and
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got seed stock that will never be
released for that exact reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made it thinking it was going to be one
thing, but it didn't live up to my
[SPEAKER_00]: expectation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a non-starter at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the photo period guys definitely
have a nice benefit of being able to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and going back and working back to
the same stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over and over again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, certainly I can appreciate how that
would be more challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_04]: My final question there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does that mean that you have to smoke like
seeded flour?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I always found like it's more
difficult for me to sort of guess the
[SPEAKER_04]: winner.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess it's this fine balance of
making seed and having some flour to
[SPEAKER_04]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you combat that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you just smoke the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've recently got one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're called the pollinator over
in like the EU and other places like the
[SPEAKER_00]: tumbler where you can sift the heads of
the trichomes off without destroying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I can't blast seeded flour or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pick the seeds out and try to leave the
actual flour intact as best as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to smoke seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'll do the Keef as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the only way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no well, I'm going to smoke this
other plant that's not pollinated and
[SPEAKER_00]: assume it's the same as the seeded one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just I smoke seeded flour and
that's kind of all there is to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for falling on your sword for
all of our benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just such a funny idea like smoking
seeded flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one likes to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like in this case, it's truly for
the greater good.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so I mean, the first of the Patreon
questions, we got some really good ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one from one of our supporters
is they wanted to know, have you ever felt
[SPEAKER_04]: like or found what you felt was sort of
the unique terpene that was sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: brought or associated with the Ruderalis
gene at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think there aren't necessarily
unique profiles associated with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned earlier that my older
brother and some of his friends would say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this tastes like an auto flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like an auto flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had anyone be able to describe
what that tastes like to me, and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never associated any individual flavor
with an auto flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people even think and have
thought for a long time that all autos
[SPEAKER_00]: taste the same, and it just couldn't be
further from the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like so many flavors out there
now that, yeah, it's just it's not a real
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never actually had any pure
Ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't say whether I've like tasted a
Ruderalis terp before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten in online discussions with
Todd McCormick, who's like adamantly
[SPEAKER_00]: against auto flours and saying they suck
and they taste like shit and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get you high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just tried to, as diplomatically as
possible, explain to him that that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: the case anymore and tell him,
look, I've got stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guarantee you I have flavors that you've
never had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I've sent them seeds before and
I'm sure they just went straight in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people like that, like my greatest
compliment is photo period purists that
[SPEAKER_00]: are like, damn, this is an auto flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, that's the tops for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I can change somebody's mind
through the work that, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: through the work that I've done,
that's like, that's the ultimate
[SPEAKER_00]: compliment for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as an actual auto flour terp,
I can't say that I've ever had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of Ruderalis, this is the hundred
year anniversary of the discovery of
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the people that grows my gear is
actually related to the person that found
[SPEAKER_00]: it as an ancestor of the person that
classified it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he reached out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was like, I just wanted to let
you know, it's like a hundred years since
[SPEAKER_00]: this happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh my God, that was like
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of me wanted to reproduce like a
lot of my old stuff and try to put out a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred different varieties of through,
through the years of my catalog as like
[SPEAKER_00]: the hundred year anniversary thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I realized that was way too far
fetched with all the projects I had going
[SPEAKER_00]: on and just would have been an insane
thing to try to take on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's pretty, a pretty cool
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do, I really want to do an auto
flower documentary and go out and like
[SPEAKER_00]: interview, you know, joint doctor and
Dutch passion and Mephisto and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have like helped to create
this thing and make it to where it is
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of, I haven't taken like a
break from doing this in a decade,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like you get in the garden and
you're on the garden schedule and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of me really wants to take a break
and dedicate some time and energy into
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that because I think it would open a
lot of people's eyes to kind of see how
[SPEAKER_00]: far they've come and see how much work has
actually been put into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a pipe dream for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope someone smarter and more well
equipped than I takes the lead on that and
[SPEAKER_00]: does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be more than happy to help out and
kind of give guidance as far as,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from my perspective,
who are the right people to talk to and
[SPEAKER_00]: who have been doing it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think something like that would be
really, really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the idea of the documentary.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, everything you said was great,
but that you're right.
[SPEAKER_04]: That sort of documentary, you can really
see that coming to life and being quite a
[SPEAKER_04]: compelling story overall, because,
you know, there's really not that many
[SPEAKER_04]: players in it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You can really trace it quite easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all still alive right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's become such a like big thing
where it's not just for the longest time
[SPEAKER_00]: was just auto flowers or European junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some people will say they're
worldwide junk, but they're really just I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, they're they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've come so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sheer amount of progress and evolution
of these plants in the past decade has
[SPEAKER_00]: done like anything else that I've ever,
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, I think there's potential
to do something really, really cool and
[SPEAKER_00]: really special with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe now that I put it out there,
you know, maybe it'll come to fruition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can actually take some time off
and figure out how to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: The next question we got from one of our
listeners was they wanted to know if you'd
[SPEAKER_04]: ever considered doing like some land race
style work using some of the land race
[SPEAKER_04]: auto flowers out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just said, oh, you know,
like, I don't know, like Siberian by Thai
[SPEAKER_04]: or Siberian by Afghan or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you ever consider doing that sort of
land race work or do you consider that
[SPEAKER_04]: like those core building blocks are really
necessary to make a high quality auto and
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: You take so long to go from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that's really intriguing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I think there's a gentleman,
I think his name is like Guardian of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Terps or something like that that has a
Siberian land race auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that would be really cool to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's just the land races is
where it all began.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a real there should be
a real concerted effort made to preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: those to continue to keep those pure and
work with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love to to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see myself doing it from modern auto
flower stock as opposed to actually going
[SPEAKER_00]: back to a ruderalis stock because I feel
like I'd be able to extract the best
[SPEAKER_00]: possible outcome using stuff that I know
and can breed away from my auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: traits and select for the land race
traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep the auto flower characteristic of
actually flowering under 24 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I love the land race stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delica Express is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite strains, if not my
favorite strain of all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I I I think I improved on the actual
example Delica photo period for my taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the auto flower version more than I
like the photo period at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one that I'm going to work back
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently got some Zamo Delica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was called like the scary, you know,
the super trippy, you know, some F3 Zamo
[SPEAKER_00]: Delica seeds from my buddies on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm planning on popping some of those
and crossing the Zamo Delica Express back
[SPEAKER_00]: to that and working that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same for the destroyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's a strain that should be
put in auto flower format.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really looking forward to I got some
some seeds of that that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just aren't around anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking forward to doing that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to also go back and do some of
the Pakistani stuff and the Afghan stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and really like, you know, lock those in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's just there's so many projects
and so few of me and so few hours in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only I can only do so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope to give a provide the proper
show the way to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like don't half ass it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, do the proper selections and be
in it for creating something new that you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's better than what it was
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the other day I was like,
what what businesses what things have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten better over the past few years?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like almost everything surrounding
us has like been in decline these past few
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I feel like Amazon is the only
thing that's actually gotten better with
[SPEAKER_00]: time is like, all right, well,
I can get anything I want shipped to me in
[SPEAKER_00]: two days now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, I feel like
everything else has kind of gotten worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And prices continue to go up and inflation
keeps happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's to the point where,
honestly, I do think I'm going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: raise my prices next year just to continue
to stay afloat with everything else is
[SPEAKER_00]: when I started selling seeds in 2015 or
whatever $50 then is now $68 in today's
[SPEAKER_00]: market, you know, and I'm not charging
more per pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still charging the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything else has gotten way more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it is kind of hard to keep
doing it the way I've been doing it and
[SPEAKER_00]: stay afloat sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, I'd be doing it
again, whether the money was involved or
[SPEAKER_00]: not, I'm going to continue doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that resonates with people and
that shows in their grows with my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it is what it is whether whether I
can make a living doing just this or
[SPEAKER_00]: whether I'm going to have to, you know,
swing a hammer figure out how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: electrical work like JJ, man, nothing but
respect them up to that dude for even
[SPEAKER_00]: posting that, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like a really fucking badass
thing for him to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah, this is like this is
where we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it goes back to the bulk seed
companies coming in and just it's a it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: different beast than it was 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a it's trying at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, you know, I have a lot of
followers on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people think I'm some huge company,
but it's just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's a lot of work, a lot of
dedication, a lot of blood, sweat and
[SPEAKER_00]: tears, a lot of risks taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just I mean, it's the plant is
special and it reverberates with me and I
[SPEAKER_00]: reverberate with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we we we have this this love and
understanding for each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I've only ever come close
to finding in a dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just like weird loyalty to each other
where we we we just find each other in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's a.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I went on a tangent there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what the initial
question was anymore, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this and I'm stoked to be able to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was about to say that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I 100 percent agree with every sentiment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, big love to JJ for putting that
post out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you said, it's it's a bit of the sign
of the times, but it's also a sign of,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, his character and strength.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I said, I myself have always
advocated that people have a day job.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my reason for that, beyond anything
else, is that I think it allows you a bit
[SPEAKER_04]: of extra freedom to explore the weird
stuff in cannabis that maybe doesn't yield
[SPEAKER_04]: as well or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's getting to that point now where,
as you said, you know, it's just the times
[SPEAKER_04]: are changing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But look, let's end the Patreon questions
with a positive one, one that several
[SPEAKER_04]: people asked in one form or another.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be your advice for someone who
wants to start breeding autos?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess the question would be,
you know, the obvious answer is get
[SPEAKER_04]: yourself a pack of autos.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, do you think that you need to
have a photo period you want to work with
[SPEAKER_04]: first?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think get a bunch of exposure to
different autos first and then figure out
[SPEAKER_04]: what you want to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: What would just be some general advice for
someone who wants to get into the world of
[SPEAKER_04]: autos and maybe breeding them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever way you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a million ways to skin a cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started out with photo to auto and kind
of that was my path for it was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what I wanted to see something new
brought into the world that's never
[SPEAKER_00]: existed before is an amazing feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing feat, especially when it's
like, when you have high standards for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're hyper critical of myself,
so I'm always trying to outdo myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: push the limits as much as I can,
and make things better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done tons and tons of auto to auto
process, I've done tons of photo to auto
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no wrong way to get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you're passionate about doing,
do that whatever, whatever speaks to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think a lot of people get into the
get get the idea in their head that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to do a photo to auto and
once they get to the F2 generation realize
[SPEAKER_00]: no, maybe I don't have the room to
properly do this to where I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to pull out from this 25% that
show auto the actual things that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for and they get discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't man there's just just keep
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep pushing forward, you know,
find a male you like in that first run,
[SPEAKER_00]: save the pollen from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the next run use that pollen on a
female you like like there's multiple ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it and move it forward and do it
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also at this point in time,
there's enough photo or enough auto period
[SPEAKER_00]: auto periods, enough auto flowers out
there that you can do auto to auto and
[SPEAKER_00]: create something completely new.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, really get a pack of autos just
like you said, but now there's there's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a ton of ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever, whatever speaks to you is the
way you should do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that it's it is good to it is good
to know the seed stock you're working from
[SPEAKER_00]: I always would recommend you know,
sink your teeth into the genetics on one
[SPEAKER_00]: side or the other whether it's the auto or
the photo so that way you know which
[SPEAKER_00]: traits to select for or against.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, yeah, man,
it's really just whatever, whatever speaks
[SPEAKER_00]: to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, just get passionate and get into
it and the path will reveal itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's about time we did our
quick fire final five.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first one, what's the best or most
memorable experience with cannabis you've
[SPEAKER_04]: ever had?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, honestly, I look back, I was at a
point in my life at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, sleeping on the floor
outside of grow tents and just busting my
[SPEAKER_00]: ass in Spain was one of the best times of
my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really felt like a kinship and a
brotherhood with the guys at the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: Mephisto and like we really clicked and
we're firing on all cylinders and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: really making a dent in the progress and
the evolution of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really do look back super fondly on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like some of my favorite times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the reasons I really like
always will hold those guys in high regard
[SPEAKER_00]: because like that was super special to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really truly cherish that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's that's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
what was one strain that all your friends
[SPEAKER_04]: had hyped up?
[SPEAKER_04]: You were really excited to try and then
when you did, you were a little let down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me think on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have I been disappointed by?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really honestly can't think of one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like weed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I one time got a roadkill skunk
from somebody that now looking back in
[SPEAKER_00]: retrospect, I couldn't even I couldn't
take more than two hits of the joint
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was so fucking gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think now knowing that person's
history and seeing how they were an insane
[SPEAKER_00]: sociopath liar, I think they sprayed some
skunk spray on that, like some some actual
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk spray stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I smoked some really bad shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was the one of the worst
experiences with cannabis I ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: But speaking of, I did recently and I
think I mentioned this to you earlier when
[SPEAKER_00]: we were chatting, I did get gifted a
roadkill skunk cut that somebody reached
[SPEAKER_00]: out to me through email three or four
times and I just kind of ignored it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was another skunk tail, as I like to
call it, where, you know, it had this long
[SPEAKER_00]: sordid history and lots of negativity
around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, they went on to reach out on
Reddit and a few other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I finally responded to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, Yeah, man, I've been trying
to give this to like CSI and archive and
[SPEAKER_00]: top dog and all these people and nobody
will respond to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I see what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I know you're an auto guy,
but would you would you be interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: taking this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, fuck it, I got a pretty serious
quarantine going at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't really at risk of anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have any like projects going that
could be put at risk if for some reason I
[SPEAKER_00]: did take in a dirty clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took it in and the gentleman went on
IC mag and started talking about it and
[SPEAKER_00]: posted pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the the internet is full of
sleuths and detectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people found that the pictures he was
posting were from somebody else's grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't the actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had like a whole bunch of
stories to try to cover, cover up for
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he like thought that I was
somehow trying to take advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: something or lying because somebody else
reached out to me with some stunts and
[SPEAKER_00]: said they wanted me to work their stunts
in the auto and just for the sake of just
[SPEAKER_00]: so nothing got lost in translation,
I made a post saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody else has these three scums.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to send me I want to make
this post here just for posterity sake
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do have your stump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I do get these other three scums,
I'll have those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sent me three cuttings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was like, oh, he's trying to say
that this isn't my skunk that he's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: these three scums from somebody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, this thread just went like haywire
and he eventually got banned from IC mag
[SPEAKER_00]: and just because of this one thread,
you know, he's talking shit about all
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been I'm just I'm letting it
edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just haven't really done anything with
it because I didn't know how to feel about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, the I was just with it a few
minutes ago, still in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: But holy shit, if it doesn't smell like
true root kill stung, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent out a t shirt recently that got
picked up by the postal inspector.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing else just a t shirt that was in
the room with that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how strong the smell is was
that, you know, a shirt got picked up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mail because of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm super stoked to work with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's got a really kind of
interesting history.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he says it's a 1988 roadkill skunk
that his dad who passed away had and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like this family heirloom thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from the right part of the
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who who actually knows what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But holy shit, man, does that thing smell
like true roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm finally at the point where I'm like
comfortable enough to put it in the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and like see what it's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny because he ended up losing
the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I sent it back to him and he lost it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent it back to him again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, it's just been in veg for
like six months at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so now he was like, man,
thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like my family heritage here,
like the fact that you got this back to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad was probably rolling over in his
grave when I lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it felt nice to be able to do that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm super stoked on on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I had my roadkill skunk shirt
that you got on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought one of those from Duke,
too, and lost it somewhere in my travels
[SPEAKER_00]: across the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this is the first thing that
I've had that is like might be for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real deal roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'm hesitant to even say
that because, you know, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody, how how saying that can even get
you, you know, looked at sideways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've kept it under wraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I posted about it maybe once on on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's something that,
man, it blew me away the past few weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: just the smell of it is just absolutely
out of this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked me if I would self it and like
release the photo period scenes of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like out there still.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, this is your clothes,
like to do whatever you want with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can give it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after the post on IC mag, like I
signed up just to like comment on this
[SPEAKER_00]: dude's thread and be like, Hey,
did send it to me immediately started
[SPEAKER_00]: having people reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, somebody on Instagram reached
out was like, Are you the dads that got
[SPEAKER_00]: this roadkill skunk from this dude down
south or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Yeah, he's over like talking on
the thread about it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went over and checked it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tied it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where things got sideways with
the three skunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, anyway, I'm super stoked to
finally get that into flower and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: the smell continues through flower and
then into the cured product because man,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is like, it might be that missing
link that everybody has been been after
[SPEAKER_00]: for so long.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll all have to wait and see how it pans
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be really exciting if it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hey, if it's the real deal,
S1s, what a way to make a splash into the
[SPEAKER_04]: photo world, I reckon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on to the next question is our desert
island question.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm going to drop you off on a
desert island.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can take three clones or three packs
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to take with you to
grow for the rest of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I made a string called desert isle
desert isle that was like one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite Indica's cross one of my favorite
sativas that was made with the intention
[SPEAKER_00]: of like, you know, if I ever needed to,
I could have to do this and then go from
[SPEAKER_00]: there and pick out like all the different
stuff from both sides that I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would probably be one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got the Zamo Delica Express in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one I mean, Zamo Delica Express
would be one if it wasn't for that strain
[SPEAKER_00]: and knowing that I would have the ability
to dig in and like refine some stuff from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm going to say the desert isle
desert isle strain, the probably cosmic
[SPEAKER_00]: queen would be another one because that
one is so so special and sentimental to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for for I've got what I call owl
pellets, which every seed harvest I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever made, I throw some up into a jar and
I sell those as a mystery mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might just grab a handful of those and
then toss those in just for shits and
[SPEAKER_00]: giggles and, you know, find what I find
when I find it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you got the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's let's have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, the next question is if you had
to restart the company with just one pack
[SPEAKER_04]: of your current seeds, which pack would
you pick?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is my biggest fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost on a weekly basis of like what
would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I there's been times in my life,
especially moving across country where I
[SPEAKER_00]: split up my seed stock into half and I'll
send half and drive with the other half
[SPEAKER_00]: just in case like something happens or
doesn't make it and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: see each other at the finish line sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I was to start over with just one
seed pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zomadele express tends to be dominant in
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't feel like that would be one
that would I don't think that would be the
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really, really tough question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd have to be a pack of auto rags just
for the sake of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably Wizards Apprentice or Blue
Microverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those two, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, both of those I'm super confident
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm extremely happy with the results of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how they breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I can pull out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know which way to turn at any given
generation with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like one of those would would be
probably the Wizards Apprentice because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's bigger overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little bit hearty, heartier
structure to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's go with Wizards Apprentice.
[SPEAKER_04]: A great pick, a great pick.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, final question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a time machine for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go anywhere, anytime, any place.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you going to get?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd go with Bodhi on some of his trips
around the world and see what he's seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that dude's lived a life and I'd love
to be along for the ride and I know you
[SPEAKER_00]: asked him that same question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wherever he was going, I'd be right
there with him.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he said he'd go to the Ewok
village and smoke with them, which again,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any comments, thoughts, shout outs?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I've been a fan for a long,
long time.

as the people you have on the show.

[SPEAKER_00]: It's truly an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a request.

[SPEAKER_00]: of this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bird's chirping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so serene and tranquil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, I just absolutely love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's even possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, thank you so much for having me
on.
