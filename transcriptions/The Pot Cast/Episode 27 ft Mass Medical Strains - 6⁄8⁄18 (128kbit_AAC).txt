[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All righty, so a big thank you and welcome
to one of the fresh faces on the block,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mass Medical Strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, a deviant question from the first
question, which is kind of becoming a new
[SPEAKER_01]: first question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you smoking on at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, I actually just smoked on some Star
Pupil that I grew a couple months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really, really cured now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a couple of my last nugs because
I took a break from perpetual harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just like trying to make my last
stash last me until my next stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, some Star Pupil, I chopped it a
little bit early, like eight weeks instead
[SPEAKER_02]: of nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a little bit racy, but really,
really tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty much been my favorite for the
last five years or so at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you find that she kind of comes
into her prime at that point of curing or
[SPEAKER_01]: it just happens to be where you're at?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it after about a month,
month and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, probably closer to a month is like
when it starts getting like really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's pretty tasty right off the bat
just because like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe because there's not much
chlorophyll, it's like so purple that like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's got a unique flavor pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you mentioned that, you know,
you took her eight weeks instead of nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the range of the harvest window
for her?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is it like somewhere between eight
and 10 or just eight and nine?
[SPEAKER_02]: I pretty much always go nine weeks with
her because that's just what I've found is
[SPEAKER_02]: the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what pretty much
everybody preases like right on nine weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know, she was going a little
bit faster under the cobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I chopped her a little early and it
seems pretty fucking strong too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes under LED, I'll go just over
eight weeks and the cobs seem to go even
[SPEAKER_02]: faster than like the purples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you fully converted to the LEDs
now or are you just still toying around
[SPEAKER_01]: with it before you transition?
[SPEAKER_02]: I switched over most of my lights to LEDs
and I've got a couple, I've got CMHs and I
[SPEAKER_02]: got the ceramic HPS from Horlox that I'm
testing out, but mostly LED and I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: growing for years under different LEDs and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've just always liked them a little
bit better than the HIC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now if we jump back to our normal first
question, what was your first experience
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a fun one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first time I smoked was with a
friend from New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically me and him were both
thinking about smoking weed because at
[SPEAKER_02]: least for me, I grew up in kind of that
mindset where like, oh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: weed is a drug and it's bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they taught you in school,
like that it's a gateway drug and all that
[SPEAKER_02]: crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So initially I didn't think weed was like
anything I would ever touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually one of my best friends like
started smoking weed when we were like 13
[SPEAKER_02]: or 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I didn't really like hang out
with him much after that because I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh shit, like he's a bad person now
and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a few years later, I realized
like, damn, a couple of my older friends
[SPEAKER_02]: that I look up to that are really smart
and they're successful, like they smoke
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And almost every single day, and they're
awesome people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I genuinely respect everything about
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's no way that weed is bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, eventually I figured out
like weed is not that crazy ass drug that
[SPEAKER_02]: they tell you like in middle school and
shit, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, me and my friend, he came from
New York to visit me for like a week and
[SPEAKER_02]: he brought some weed and he's like,
dude, let's smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just smoked last week for the first time
and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like we rolled up this joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Sensei Star, he said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just remember like we went deep into
the woods because we're all scared of
[SPEAKER_02]: getting caught and we smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we came out of the woods and I was
just like waiting and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, I'm not seeing anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like where's the dragons and shit flying
around in my vision?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just started laughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, you don't see things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't know, I didn't feel
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't like, I didn't know what the hell
to expect, but I wasn't experiencing what
[SPEAKER_02]: I expected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then smoked a bunch of times after
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hadn't really been taught how to
inhale properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then actually I went to Europe and I
smoked a few times there and still like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, nothing really happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was like, yeah, I like smoking,
you know, it's chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just smoked with my friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend that I was staying with in
Germany, he gave me this DVD and he was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, dude, you've got to watch this
video.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, all right, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll get to it eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never ended up watching it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he kept asking me to watch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, yeah, I forgot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll watch it tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so I get home and I brought the
video home and I opened it up and there
[SPEAKER_02]: was like two grams of weed in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I flew back with it, not even knowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then this was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where I actually got high for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just learned how to properly inhale
and it rolled up two joints of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was nighttime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just smoked both of them to my face by
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden it fucking hit me
like a train.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just felt like this feeling watched
over me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I immediately just thought I was going
to die.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just freaking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the whole entire night I was just by
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I thought I was giving myself
surgery at one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was ridiculous because I just smoked
way too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just hit me super hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a crazy, memorable time just
because the music that I listened to that
[SPEAKER_02]: night, it just stuck with me in a special
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just realized, damn, this is some
powerful shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't smoke after that for a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I don't know why I even tried
again, but I ended up liking it a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so would you say that was the point
when you kind of really got into it or
[SPEAKER_01]: like were you still sporadic in your usage
for a while?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was about, it was a gradual thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'd probably smoke once a week or
once every couple of weeks or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just gradually got more into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I started realizing there's
different strains and stuff and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, this weed I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this weed I don't like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, this one has a different taste
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it started getting pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really think too much about it
because I was young, but I guess I just
[SPEAKER_02]: liked it for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just kept smoking it more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so outside of the, uh, the sensei star
you mentioned initially, what was some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the other strains that were going around
in that earliest times?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like most notably you mentioned some of
them were catching your attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember specifically, or was it
just kind of like, like the kind bud type
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember a few different times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like the best one that one of the best
smokes I've had in my life was way back
[SPEAKER_02]: then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was this blueberry and I got it twice
and I never ever got it again after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember it so distinctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just had this amazing, like
everything about it, the texture,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it was cured really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't even know like anything about
curing, but I just knew like, damn,
[SPEAKER_02]: the consistency of this, it's like juicy,
but it's not wet and it's sticky as hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like so delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the eye was so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been growing blueberry plants all
the time looking for this, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and just never finding it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever that was, I'm still
searching.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then some other, I mean, we got like
Kush and Hayes, which were just called
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush and Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there, there wasn't much of a name to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember like, my dealer was like,
yeah, Kush is when it's good and Hayes is
[SPEAKER_02]: when it's not so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I bought the Hayes and I was like,
dude, I love the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And turns out now like I'm really big into
Sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back then I didn't even know there was
like different, because in Sativas and
[SPEAKER_02]: effects, I just knew there was like
different names to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never believed the name because I
didn't know if he's making it up,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that Hayes was pretty good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some AK 47.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that blueberry comment you made is
one we hear a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like, you know, blueberry is
so prolific, but it's also like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's no one can really find that one cut
at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of lucid for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I've noticed I've grown blueberry
from a few different breeders and I got
[SPEAKER_02]: one where it had that high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It maybe even had a better high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like one of the best highs ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was every single time you smoke it,
you just felt like how you felt when you
[SPEAKER_02]: were like 10 years old, like so pure and
so amazed and everything's so perfect and
[SPEAKER_02]: fun and interesting, like just the best
mood ever and super nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but the flavor was fucking horrible
and it wasn't blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like something really good,
but it wasn't the plant that I'm looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm digging into some clones from
different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this one from New York,
which I'm hoping is the one because a lot
of bud from New York comes up here,
but I'm really not as we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say that because I often have thought
to myself when DJ first made blueberry,
[SPEAKER_01]: how, how long did it sit there before they
realized it was blueberry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I can only imagine they didn't find
the insane blueberry Fino in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of seeds they popped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wouldn't be surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've, I think that more likely than
not, they didn't know there was the
[SPEAKER_01]: blueberry Finos in there for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, I don't know how consistent his
stock was back then or is now,
[SPEAKER_02]: or like if his goal was the blueberry or
if he just found the blueberry and then
[SPEAKER_02]: kept going with it or whatever,
like you said, there could have been all
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of other stuff in there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously topic near and dear to the
heart of this show, the chem dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're in mass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever see it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually I'm not that into chem
personally, but I've smoked something
[SPEAKER_02]: grown by him apparently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was fucking really strong because I
smoked one hit and I forgot I even smoked
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was like, what the fuck is happening
to me?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, I remembered that I smoked
and it was just like, it was such an
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and one of my kind of friends,
more of just an acquaintance, like a
[SPEAKER_02]: friend of a friend, apparently his dad,
his best friends with Ken dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, fuck, I can't tell this
dude that I grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I don't really tell anybody locally
that I grow, especially if I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: them while they're like, I think they're
shady and this gets kind of shady.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, I can't tell them that I
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how, how do I get to meet Ken without
dropping the fact that I'm a breeder and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was just like, so I haven't ran
into him personally yet, but I'm growing a
[SPEAKER_02]: few different time cuts right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what's what, but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good weed for sure, but it's not
exactly my taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've never been super duper into it
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very polarizing type of weed,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what is it about it that you're not
a fan of?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most common thing people say
is it's just so non-functional in many
[SPEAKER_01]: respects.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd probably agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not very functional.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just kind of fucks you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of weed that has that effect
for me where it just feels like,
[SPEAKER_02]: damn, I'm fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and that's not what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't smoke to get fucked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke to feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke to relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke to focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke to feel better, whatever it is,
but I don't really smoke to feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: on drugs specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sometimes like a real nice trippy
high is nice, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to just feel like
debilitated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a bit full on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So last one I've got to ask about,
did you ever see the mass super skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: growing up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not personally, no, I wish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still like such a small kind of
select period and area when it was around,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to ask a few people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I haven't came across it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody has it around
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's long gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people say it's around,
but I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, kind of get back on track for a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you kind of start to grow
yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and more importantly,
what were the first strains you were
[SPEAKER_01]: growing out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically I always like, like I told
you how I used to have the impression that
[SPEAKER_02]: weed was like this really bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also thought like, if you grow,
you're just the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you don't grow, you're going to go to
prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like growing is very bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's a lot worse than smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a while I never even thought about
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one time it was funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually my mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was like, she knows that I smoke and
she's fine with it, but she was like
[SPEAKER_02]: scared.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to get some laced weed or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she was like, you should grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you think I should grow
really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've been thinking about it,
but I thought it was like, so dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, now just grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's safer for you and blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I ended up growing because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that was the final push.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the first plants I grew was the
seeds that actually led to star pupil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friend had given me a bunch of
seeds and basically they were Thai and
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghani and you didn't really know
anything about them at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't know anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I just like, I'll plant them in some
solar crops, like he said to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I put them on my windowsill and then
eventually like they were getting all
[SPEAKER_02]: stringy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my friend was like, dude, you got to
get that under a light or put it outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to a growth store and they were
like, are you in veg or flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need a light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, I did so much reading and nothing
made any sense to me, but I was just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they're in, they're in the cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're five inches tall, but they're
not doing, they're not growing fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had them for like almost two months
and they're like, they look like two week
[SPEAKER_02]: old seedling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got a light, put them in a closet and
I only had six plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I ended up putting one of them planting
it out in the woods and the rest of them
[SPEAKER_02]: had flowered out in doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of them was a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by this point I was obsessed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like by the time they were actually,
get to flower, I was reading every single
[SPEAKER_02]: day about growing and asking my friends
and learning stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my friend told me that you could put
fan on them to make them stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, cause the wind and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just blew my mind because I was
like, people know shit about growing weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was, I didn't realize that there
was knowledge up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just started getting obsessed
and I would like talk to people every day
[SPEAKER_02]: and read and learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so I was like, all right,
I'm even going to make some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems easy enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each plant, I just made seeds on like
one bottom branch, but I was mainly just
[SPEAKER_02]: focusing on growing the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like I said, I had one male and
then, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the plants I actually named it
star pupil because it was super
[SPEAKER_02]: symmetrical and it just looked so awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so I just named each plant
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just had funny names and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically I grew those out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The star pupil was like this half purple,
half green kind of, it's not the exact
[SPEAKER_02]: star pupil I have now, but it's the mother
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It finished in 52 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember reading that everything had
to go eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just what I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, why is it done sooner?
[SPEAKER_02]: And why is this tall one not finished yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to let it go longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I was reading every day,
but there was just so much to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I harvested those and I smoked
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cured them, saved the seeds off each one,
labeled separately and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then my next run, I was like,
all right, auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been reading auto flowers are the
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to grow some.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ordered some and I grew them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, what the fuck is
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so disappointed with the auto
flowers in comparison to like the first
[SPEAKER_02]: plants that I grew that were like so
amazing and super strong and they all had
[SPEAKER_02]: their own unique character.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I grew like four different strains of
autos that I purchased.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew the strain names.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, why is Blue Dream and
Northern Lights the same as Blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: Bliss?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I don't know if it's the
autos or strains or bullshit or what,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I was just figuring shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really like that star pupil plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to grow a bunch of seeds
that I made off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one of them ended up being my
star pupil almond.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been keeping the clone of her ever
since.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the star pupil that you offer now,
is that like an F2 of the initial strain
[SPEAKER_01]: you made or where's it at?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's actually an S1, the seeds that I
raised.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is I had this star pupil
clone and I've been growing it and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: super good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, what if my clones don't
make it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what if I fuck up and lose it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I better make some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was like, how do I get it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the best way to make seeds of this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I just want this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to cross it with anything
else because it might be worse or better
[SPEAKER_02]: or different, but I want this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I learned about like making feminized
seeds and how you could cross plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically I made S1s of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people were saying like,
if you grow out S1s, they're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the exact same as the mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other people were saying, no,
they're going to be all over the place and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to herm and they're going to
suck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, fuck it, I'll just try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I got really lucky that for
whatever reason, when you S1 the star
[SPEAKER_02]: pupil, every single plant is like spot on
to the star pupil, super, super close to
[SPEAKER_02]: the mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what the star pupil seeds are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then since then, obviously I got into
actual breeding and making regular seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: and doing some line work and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But star pupil seeds, they're always just
S1s because it's like the most perfect
[SPEAKER_02]: representation of the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so are you considering doing like a
back cross or even like a cubing process
[SPEAKER_01]: down the line?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm actually working on some right
now and they're all in seedling stage
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just waiting to see what they do
basically and go from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've done a lot of different out
process and stuff, and I'm working on some
[SPEAKER_02]: back crosses and some femming back crosses
with a nice S1 that I found and just
[SPEAKER_02]: messing around with different things to
see what I can come up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you were to kind of think long
term about it and you were going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe an extended back crossing project
with the idea that the initial male you
[SPEAKER_01]: use is probably not going to be really
present after a few back crosses,
[SPEAKER_01]: but maybe some of the characteristics from
it could be like maybe things you could
[SPEAKER_01]: improve on the star pupil.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that in mind, what type of things
would you be looking for to bring,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you were going to do say a
cube project, you know, what is something
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a male could bring to the table that
would be an improvement?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that I like about a lot of the
other plants that I created is that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, the poutang has a really,
really nice stretch where you could veg
[SPEAKER_02]: that thing to be like four and a half
tall, and then you flower it and it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: four and a half feet tall with like a fuck
ton of branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just like this monster plant
where you don't really have to veg it that
[SPEAKER_02]: long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would probably put something like
that into it, just like some more bigger,
[SPEAKER_02]: shorten up the veg time a little,
just because that's the style that I
[SPEAKER_02]: usually breathe with for other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it yields pretty good,
but you could, I mean, I'd probably try to
[SPEAKER_02]: add a little bit of yield to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is yield something you consider when
you're braiding or is it really like a
[SPEAKER_01]: peripheral consideration?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yield is not too important, but I don't
want to say I don't care about it because
[SPEAKER_02]: if something yields really low,
I'm going to toss it unless it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: super, super special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the Ritz pupil is my lowest yielding
strain, which I don't even offer anymore,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's such as really good smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was worth keeping around for a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I kind of made things that I
think were a little bit better and yielded
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like very, you know,
Ritz pupil, like people who want it,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll make more as freebies,
but I like everything to at least have
[SPEAKER_02]: like a medium to high yield, depending on
what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the main thing that I really breathe
for is like the vibe of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: how it is when you smoke it, like what you
feel when you smoke it, what you
[SPEAKER_02]: experience, how you feel after you've
smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, some stuff you can smoke
it, you feel great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then afterwards you feel super drained
and shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't even like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like something where you can smoke it
and you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you come down and you can,
you know, like exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to smoke again to feel
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can, you might even feel better
after you've smoked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you might have a nice experience
where you're like, life is fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I feel uplifted now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even after you're not high anymore,
like that's the kind of stuff I like,
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that just leaves you feeling really
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so out of your lineup, what do you
think best represents that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the star pupil, especially from
the feedback that I've been getting from
[SPEAKER_02]: people lately, like it kind of blows my
mind because I really liked it as a plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I know that everyone's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every time somebody else likes it as
much as I do, it's like really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides the star pupil, I have a couple of
sativas, like the deadly sativa is really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one's too much for a lot of
people, but if you smoke a very small
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of it, it's super, super uplifting
and refreshing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the prayer pupil for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I still remember the first time that
I smoked that 33% phenol that I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was just such an uplift.
[SPEAKER_02]: The experience and like actually an old
timer's hay is too, it was a great night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was up all night, but I smoked it at 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd probably stay up till like six in the
morning from that shit.
And it was like, I like the stuff where
you smoke it and you make memories,
you know, like you remember when you
smoked that strain because it was so
unique or such a good time or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just like something that blends in
with the rest and you fell asleep on the
[SPEAKER_02]: couch or something like that's no fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Old timer's hay, that's an interesting
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't hear about too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you plan on releasing any crosses with
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made the cross just to see what would
happen because it was a crazy plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like took them 17 weeks of
flower and then 19 for the green phenol.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really liked that 17 week purple
phenol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I made a few different beans on them
and I wasn't really thinking of releasing
[SPEAKER_02]: them because I was just like, these are
going to be wacky or people aren't going
[SPEAKER_02]: to want this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, the saying how everyone
says, oh, I want a really gnarly sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other dude says, no,
you actually don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just think you want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you get to that point where
you're like here, these seeds will take 17
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks to flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to grow them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody says no, even though they ask
for it until that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like people people think
they want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if they actually do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I made them kind of for myself and for
my friends to dig through and see what
[SPEAKER_02]: happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I ended up getting a lot of beans off
them off the boom and boom cross because
[SPEAKER_02]: that was a pretty big plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I mean, I've only seen a few of
them grown out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see more of them grown out and
I got to grow some myself because my
[SPEAKER_02]: friends have been growing on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I want to see what those do and
then we'll go from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might become available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave out some as freebies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the star pupil, old timers haze,
those are just for me and friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got some of those just starting to
flower now and I'm hoping to find some
[SPEAKER_02]: cool clone only purple haze, kind of pupil
haze, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it sounds interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just out of curiosity with those
old timer blue Magoo crosses, what did the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering time work out to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because something I've noticed from toying
around with the Magoo myself is it's such
[SPEAKER_01]: a consistent eight-week plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you pair it with that
17-weeker, does it just meet in the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: or do you get some that just fall all over
the spectrum?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, like I said, I've only seen a few of
them so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically it seems like there's a
Magoo dominant Pheno that goes a little
[SPEAKER_02]: faster, but it's probably some kind of 10,
12 weekish thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the haze one seems to be like,
I think it's around 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is a little bit shorter,
but it's still super long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of met in the middle a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know how much variation is
going to actually be in those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we just loop back to a point you
made a moment ago, you mentioned you enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: Professor P's photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you into photography slash would you
want to get into it more so eventually?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm definitely super into
photography and he's definitely an
[SPEAKER_02]: inspiration of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to photographing cannabis
plants and flowers and all that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just always been drawn to the way
that he captures the flower and the
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's really hard to get good lighting
compared to just like average lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you want to make it look like one
of his photos, you got to take a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: shots and got to be moving two or three
flashes around and really like trying
[SPEAKER_02]: hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like just when you see a flower and then
you try to portray it the best way you
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly can.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a lot of fun to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm usually taking pictures in the garden
almost every day and post way too much on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times I have asked it because I'm
just trying to show the plant and I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to take the plant out and put it in
front of a black background every single
[SPEAKER_02]: day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like the changes day to day and
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm always shooting photos of
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think there's a really strong
kind of link between having good photos
[SPEAKER_01]: and like sales?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause one might assume so, but you also
might think, Oh, well there's some pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: big name guys who don't really take good
photos, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know, what's crazy is that a lot
of my half-assed cell phone pictures that
[SPEAKER_02]: I post will end up getting like one or
2000 likes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll take a photo that took me an
hour to get the perfect shot and it will
[SPEAKER_02]: get like 190 likes and like zero comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't know what people are looking
for because I think they're looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: some different things in the photos
compared to what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's why I've been posting like
whatever photos I take, like some of them
[SPEAKER_02]: are just shitty phone pictures and people
love them for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe because it's even more real.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a real experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: They feel like, damn, that's what it would
look like in my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was looking at it, like that's not
some crazy high def camera and Photoshop
[SPEAKER_02]: and unreal expectations, like,
like the modeling industry, you know how
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's like fake.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe they like seeing the real stuff
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, if we look at the opposite
end of what you were just talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do you feel about breeders who
outright Photoshop?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, do you think like whatever people
want to do with their photos, that's cool
[SPEAKER_01]: by you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think it should really kind of
be a true representation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody should Photoshop their photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, people are putting filters like
Instagram filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got the sharpen and the contrast and
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think most people I would hope can
tell the difference between like a
[SPEAKER_02]: realistic photo versus like when they put
it in Photoshop and they change the hue
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you got this is overly red
pistols, not like the natural pink ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find it like sometimes you just
see really, really red hairs with like a
[SPEAKER_02]: brownish tint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can change to the bud and the
leaves are like they're not even red
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like super just like blown out and
there's pixels in the colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you see stuff like that is
Photoshop and it's just complete garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, you should be posting like
realistic photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like Professor P's photography and
like Team Terpene does a really nice job,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially with like his studio shots and
a few other guys like I like to see the
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff where they take the time to put on a
good lens and put some nice flashes in
[SPEAKER_02]: there and get the angle right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it shouldn't really be Photoshopping
or artificially modifying anything unless
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just like light levels to just,
you know, make the background a little
[SPEAKER_02]: darker, something like that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to see modified colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see what it really looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, a quick little shout out to
photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love, I was noticing the other day is
Green Dot Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does some really nice photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's actually, I was thinking of him in
my head, but I couldn't remember the name
[SPEAKER_02]: while I was saying those other two people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was only this morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah, I mean he does some good
photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something I wanted to quickly jump on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your general growth style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you mentioned you're into the LEDs
and the cobs, but you know, are you
[SPEAKER_01]: organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you bottled nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us the rundown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to talk about this because to me
it's, so important to grow organically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to answer your question, I grow
organically in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion, that's the best way to
grow period for a lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first reason being for beginners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually learned this at the grow
store.
[SPEAKER_02]: They told me why they push organics to
beginners because I was like, every other
[SPEAKER_02]: growth store I go to, they always try and
sell you chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the one that I shop at, which it's
green harvest hydroponics, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they teach a lot of people to grow
organically, even when they're a first
[SPEAKER_02]: time grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because it's just easier,
plain and simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to fuck up.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are growing synthetically,
there's a good chance you can kill a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: by over fertilizing it or getting your,
whatever your chemicals all fucked up,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the hell they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, I think it's all kind of,
I don't know, synthetic growing is not my
[SPEAKER_02]: style.
[SPEAKER_02]: I very, very rarely smoke anything grown
with nutrients at all, because I'm super
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitive to it and I feel it in my body.
And I've met other people that are the
same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people are way more sensitive
than I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I met some people that are like,
I can't smoke weed because, and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll name like something like,
oh, it fucks with my thyroid or it fucks
[SPEAKER_02]: with my lungs or my throne.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel it for the next two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm like, try organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I give them something organic,
just a little nugget of smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, I didn't have that
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, because you're
probably reacting chemicals that are in
[SPEAKER_02]: the bud, whether you know it or not,
99% of the weed out there is grown with
[SPEAKER_02]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 99% of the growers are taught that
that's how you grow weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I had my first plants that I told
you about, they were in the soil from my
[SPEAKER_02]: backyard, which I put into pots,
and then they were under LED lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at one point I was having an issue and
it turned out that my light was too close.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like bleaching them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went to a grow store,
a different grow store, and I showed them
[SPEAKER_02]: the photos and they were like,
dude, bro, you got to be hitting it with
[SPEAKER_02]: some newts, bro, your plants gonna die.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they gave me some newts and I
poured them in and I fried the hell out of
[SPEAKER_02]: my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I lost like, probably almost 50% of
the leaves on them just within a few hours
[SPEAKER_02]: were totally like crinkled and crunched
and yellow and white, like super gnarly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the one and only time that I
fed them any nutrients because I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell did I just do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And luckily they didn't die and I was able
to keep growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's just so many things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a beginner or if you're
learning, it's just easier to go with
[SPEAKER_02]: organic, but it's healthier too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say my favorite reason for
growing organic is just getting the best
[SPEAKER_02]: expression out of the plant and doing it
first try, doing it second try.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you fuck up a little bit, I see a lot
of nutrient growers that are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, I'm on my sixth rung with this cut
and I finally got dialed down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually with organic, the plant dials
itself in because the plant's choosing
[SPEAKER_02]: what it wants to take in from the soil and
the roots are interacting with all the
[SPEAKER_02]: living stuff in your soil and it's little
microbes and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, plants do really well in
organic and pretty consistently so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you run into an issue,
but usually it's straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a plant, whether it's a seed
or a clone, you put it in some good dirt
[SPEAKER_02]: and you grow it and it's incredibly
simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it takes five, 10 minutes a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go water your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make sure your air is moving around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You check all your basic things like
temperature, humidity, and it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: foolproof.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can scale it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually went to this giant operation in
Maine where it was no till and it was like
[SPEAKER_02]: 99 lights or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every single plant was organic,
just fed nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But water and they were huge and they were
doing major, major production here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a huge crew of people working
every single day there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people say you can't scale it up,
it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that they don't know how to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't tried.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't looked into it enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, organic is just the best way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to clarify, does that mean that
you're pretty much mostly like an amended
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and you just water only for the most
part?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my basic growing style is this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a super soil that's called mission
mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've also used other soils that are
similar and they all do about the same
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just the one that I like the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: But any brand works as long as it's
specific is super soil versus not just
[SPEAKER_02]: like regular potting soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to have enough stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be tailored for the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of for growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to get something that's made
for growing weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, if it's an indigo plant,
I'm going to transplant it into a spinal
[SPEAKER_02]: container one or two weeks before I flip
to flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's a sativa plant, the roots will
grow a lot more when you flip it into
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kind of transplant it right before
flip, like on the day of flip,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then just put it into flower right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just the basic technique for
growing plants in super soil, which always
[SPEAKER_02]: seems to work good for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've also got a bunch of no-till pots
where I'm on a bunch of them are just
[SPEAKER_02]: second round right now, but then I've got
some that are third and fourth and fifth
[SPEAKER_02]: round.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just add some amendments to them
each time they have worms living in them
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're bigger size pots and they're
awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you don't have to throw away soil
and buy new soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so have you found that on those plots
where you're on the fourth or the fifth
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle, for example, that it's kind of
getting better with time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's something which is commonly,
you know, spouted by the organic preachers
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of depends because some plants
like them more than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you run into a little issue
where all of a sudden your plants start in
[SPEAKER_02]: a yellow and then next week it looks good
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's definitely kind of shifting around
and constantly adjusting and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: but everything ends up doing really well,
regardless of if it's like first round or
[SPEAKER_02]: fifth round, they've all been doing pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you do grow out those more sativa,
I mean, that's pretty much all you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find that they are a little more
sensitive than say the odd indica that you
[SPEAKER_01]: run?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, sensitive, maybe as in like
hermaphroditic or, oh, um, the only
[SPEAKER_02]: challenge I've had recently was those old
timers gazes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they all got super deficient somewhere
in week 10 or 12 of flower and they were
[SPEAKER_02]: in a second round, no till pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, all right, I'm going to
save these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I fed them with some, um, um,
some teas, like graven flyer with
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put some amendments into the soil and
then they got way overfed right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just started frying and they'd
like, it totally went the opposite
[SPEAKER_02]: direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Oh shit, this is not going
to go well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a couple of weeks later they
bounced back and they started flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: more and putting out new flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Hey, this just flowers forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, that was definitely the most
finicky thing that I've grown in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most things are fairly simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only way that I fucked up on the
sativa is not enough root space or not
[SPEAKER_02]: enough soil really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, then it might get deficient before it
finishes because if it's flowering 12
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks versus eight, I need a little bit
more nutrition to carry it that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought I've been pondering over for
a while is every now and again,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk to a newbie and they'll be like,
Oh, I want to grow purple haze or like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, clearly like they haven't looked
into the specifics at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you kind of like, no, that's not a
beginner's plan at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're not even going to find the
thing you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I digress.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do grow out these haze plants or,
you know, something akin to the purple
[SPEAKER_01]: haze, so to speak, these 17 weekers and
whatnot, I was trying to think,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is it about these plants,
which specifically makes them hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the best way I could pinpoint
it is that it's kind of what you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: about if you give them, some extra
nutrients, they just start to bloom more
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and it can almost just stretch it
out indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that is the primary challenge
with these longer growing plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think it's just a variety of
other things as well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the common thing that I hear from
people is the first concern is always
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, I have X amount of height.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have five feet of height.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't grow sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I don't want to, another thing is just
the long time is people don't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: actual patience to go that long,
which I do understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the thing is you can put one of those
in the corner and have the rest of your 10
[SPEAKER_02]: be like an eight week Indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when those are done, you drive
and your old timers haze is still going
[SPEAKER_02]: for another cycle or two of your next
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then those will finish up and then
your haze is almost done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, the patience thing is like just
dedicate a little corner to it and get
[SPEAKER_02]: used to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, I'm going to grow in long time
sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really thinking about like,
when's it going to be done?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really, really nice plant to be in
the moment with and just appreciate that
[SPEAKER_02]: point every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or whenever you feel like spending some
time with it, um, just start it and enjoy
[SPEAKER_02]: it and smell it because I don't know a lot
of growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always like, Oh, when am I going to
grow next?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's, what's coming down?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going in?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're always focusing on later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always try to remind myself to like
focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the present and how beautiful
everything is like right now that I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So does sativas really teach you to do
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you think about what's coming
down, you're just going to stress out
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's not any time soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're looking at it and you're
just appreciating it, it's almost like a
[SPEAKER_02]: blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it is a blast to the past,
but it's, it's like a step backwards in
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis evolution, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you see these, they're not even
bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're barely bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just strings of calyx.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, but they're all near each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can imagine like if you squish
them next to each other, it almost becomes
[SPEAKER_02]: like a modern bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, just stuff like that,
but we got a couple off topic from the
[SPEAKER_02]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was the question again?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's, that's, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep going with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's like, you just summarized
exactly how I feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to a friend just the other
day about how I was saying to them,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even get excited about what I'm
going to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've been thinking about that
already for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm already thinking about what's
going in next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by the time I'm actually harvesting
the crop, I'm already like, I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: excited for the seeds I'm germinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you said is essentially just kind
of like mindfulness for cannabis growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like live in the moment, not in your head,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's actually why I took a break
from doing perpetual cause I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: perpetual since my third row ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just took my first perpetual break
and I was the father fucking worst idea,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I thought it would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was like, yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was a good idea because it made
me appreciate everything a little more and
[SPEAKER_02]: slow down, which was the goal of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem was I didn't have the
stuff to smoke and I'm like trying to make
[SPEAKER_02]: these grams last a couple months.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, it's, you're always in this
cycle of like, you have stuff midway
[SPEAKER_02]: through bloom and then you, you've got
this new bunch of strains that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: popping seeds of and you have stuff that's
almost ready to go into flower that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not even excited about anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're more excited about your
seedlings and you're just waiting for your
[SPEAKER_02]: flower to come down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that, that's not a good place to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a lot of people that are in that
kind of zone perpetually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more awesome to just treat every
plant as something special that it is like
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're in flower, go appreciate those
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're in your drying or curing
stage, appreciate your work right there
and don't give up.
Like keep focusing on that as if it was
your only plant because in that moment it
is the plant in front of you is all you
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just kind of paying attention to every
single stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go into your bedroom and
like, you know, don't just water them and
[SPEAKER_02]: be like, all right, boring.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to really look at the structure
and give them some stem rubs and smell
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at what kind of different funny
leaves are on different plants and who's
[SPEAKER_02]: praying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's grouping and like when you got a
whole bunch of the same strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: be like, all right, this one's a little
stretchier and this one's shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just spend more time staring at your
plants, like all of them and be excited
[SPEAKER_02]: for them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you have a plant that you're
not excited about, you shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_02]: growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something I learned when I was
like growing a really, really lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And half of it was stuff that I was just
growing cause it had it and didn't even
[SPEAKER_02]: want to smoke it cause I didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I learned like, there's no room
for those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just get them out of there,
give them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you have to just compost them and
dry them out and put them back into your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, but don't grow something.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the vibe isn't right, don't grow it
just because you have it grow because you
[SPEAKER_02]: want it and because you're excited about
it and you'll have a lot more fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the words of Mr. Bob Hemphill,
not library status, but so then that
[SPEAKER_01]: brings me to the point then pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something near and dear to my
heart because it loops back to something
[SPEAKER_01]: you just mentioned with organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so easy to pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause as you said, you do things right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant presents itself to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, you know,
are you pretty ruthless with the pheno
[SPEAKER_01]: hunting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things have to be pretty good to make the
library status.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as a followup for people out
there who are in that boat that you just
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned where maybe they grow on some
things they're not that keen about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you push people to pheno hunt more
like, or do you think just find a few
[SPEAKER_01]: plants you like and then stick with them
for a while or what's your gig?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm pheno hunting, I'm super,
super picky because even if I'm not pheno
[SPEAKER_02]: hunting and I'm just trying to grow like
one or two plants or something,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still picky as hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point is like a lot of people,
I understand because seeds are expensive
[SPEAKER_02]: and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of people, they won't throw away
anything because they're just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, you know, like I paid for that or like
it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to like never even want to
pluck a leaf off a plant in the first
[SPEAKER_02]: place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was like, I don't want to hurt it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so special.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's more of like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I call a lot of fucking plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times if I'm pheno hunting
something and I know I only have room to
[SPEAKER_02]: flower 20, I'll start 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: 150 beans anyways, and weed them out
through veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if I'm just going to flower 10
because it's like the more of a selection
[SPEAKER_02]: you have, the better plant you're going to
find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you just get lucky, you can also
plant one single seed and get lucky,
[SPEAKER_02]: find something really awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you pop a whole bunch of seeds,
if you have the ability to, whether you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to grow out all of them or maybe
give some away to friends, like if I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: flower everything, I'll give away a few
nice looking ones to friends and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, if this is any good, just get me a
cut back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it never ends up being anything good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But usually, at least with my own lines
when I'm breeding, I know what I'm looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can weed out a lot in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I know pretty good idea,
like which females I want to grow about
[SPEAKER_02]: just based on their growth patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then see if I find the flower,
flower qualities that I'm looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a lot to be said in a stem
rub.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't really realize that a stem
rub on one specific day doesn't tell you
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you stem rub every plant,
maybe every week, let's say you got like
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 plants, stem rub all of them every week
to take notes on every single one because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them will give you that hint
that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, when I was looking for
my prayer tower male, I had grown prayer
[SPEAKER_02]: tower a few different times before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew which female I liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to find a male that had that
female, which is, you know, a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was stem rubbing all the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on one specific day, the male that
ended up being the one had the smell I was
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for, but it never had it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: But none of the other plants ever had it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went with that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, this has to be the one
that has this soapy hashy smell that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like this creamy soap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how to explain it,
but it ended up being the one.
And then it passed on the exact rates of
looking for it in the flower department.
And I mean, it checked all the other
boxes, too.
But that's just one example of how like
the stem rub can tell you a lot,
but it won't just tell you every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to really check them out on
different days, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something I had noticed, and I'd love
to run by you, is you can actually get
[SPEAKER_01]: different smells, whether you rub the stem
at the new growth, where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the shoot is rather green versus say,
you know, a little bit more woody,
[SPEAKER_01]: hardened growth down low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you take note of the differences or do
that at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I usually rub probably three
quarters of the plant just by habit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, I don't know, sometimes they'll
check different parts of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they find something interesting,
I'll take another finger and rub a
[SPEAKER_02]: different part of the plant and like
really look into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if there's no smell or not much
smell, I'll try and rub like a different
[SPEAKER_02]: part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely, I think it's almost like
how if you have a big clone or a big mom
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're taking clones and like one
round, all the top clones root and the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottoms don't root that well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next round, it's the other
way around.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like how the plant has
different levels of hormones in different
[SPEAKER_02]: areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you generally take clones from
the top and the bottom or just wherever it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to work at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you use to stimulate rooting
given that you're organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, so clones are fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always used to take from the bottom
because I learned that from the internet
[SPEAKER_02]: or from whoever, it's like bottom clones
root faster because they're closer to the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last year or two,
people like when I started telling people
[SPEAKER_02]: about that, they're like, dude,
you got to take them from the top so you
[SPEAKER_02]: get way better clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I've been doing a bit of both
because I've always had great plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: taking roots, taking cuts from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even think it matters.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess the next step would be to
take a bottom clone and a top clone and
[SPEAKER_02]: flower them side by side and see if
there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really don't think there's going to
be as long as it's a healthy clone,
[SPEAKER_02]: a healthy mother plant, and it stays
pretty healthy while rooting and going
[SPEAKER_02]: through that transformation for being a
branch to a new plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it doesn't like almost die or
something like it's just going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a clone is a clone as long as
it's healthy and happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I do for clones is very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take an arrow cloner like it's a
bucket full of water and there's an air
[SPEAKER_02]: stone and an air pump and the water is
bubbling around and just take some cuts
[SPEAKER_02]: like I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to take really small cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know any better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I take a little bigger ones,
but at least probably six, seven inches or
[SPEAKER_02]: something is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like maybe 10 inch cut is pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually the big ones are stronger plants
from the get go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really matter that much,
but basically just cut off a branch and
[SPEAKER_02]: stick it in the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then two or three weeks later,
it's really, really easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time I dipped them all in aloe and
they all died.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like, all right, none of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Going back to straight water worked for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not going to change anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one time I had some really
difficult cuts that I couldn't root.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget what strains they were,
but somebody was like, yeah, just
[SPEAKER_02]: pretended to deep water culture,
just throw in all the newts and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: like super diluted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did that and they fucking rooted
like monsters and they were growing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cloner and they had like these huge,
like unbelievable overkill roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you need a boost, you can put shit
in there, but I never do because it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I did it that one time and I just
couldn't get something to root or survive
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, the only thing that I help them
with sometimes I don't even do it every
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I remember is I'll spray them
with a foliar spray, like the first four
[SPEAKER_02]: days or so and that'll just beat them a
little bit, but you don't even have to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I usually, I just have like a
separate layer, like underneath one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: tables in my bedroom and I just have like
white sheets under there and I put my
[SPEAKER_02]: cloners under there and just fill them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you just have to remember to
check the water, maybe once a week,
[SPEAKER_02]: like put some, you know, empty it out,
clean it out, put some new water in,
[SPEAKER_02]: or just top it off once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just waiting and basically
forgetting and then remembering and then
[SPEAKER_02]: they're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And heck, you can't get much more organic
than plain water, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you generally like to push people to
constantly be popping new seeds in pheno
[SPEAKER_01]: hunting or are you kind of okay with the
idea that people just run the same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: for a while?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, luckily most of the people that I
know, not all of them, but most of them
[SPEAKER_02]: are pretty into popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's cool because I love giving them
seeds and watching them grow them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in general, I definitely tell people
never stop popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar to like what Bodhi said,
just every seed is its own plant and it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like such a special thing inside
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, yeah, all these elite clones and
popular clones are, most of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them, whatever, but I mean,
they're great plants, but it's not that
[SPEAKER_02]: hard to find your own plants that are just
as good or better or different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, in my opinion, when you plant a
seed, that plant, you know, it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has an emotional bond with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have one with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that plant is, it's just going to be
closer to you than a clone that you got
[SPEAKER_02]: from someone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what, you can love a clone too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you watch a plant grow up from
seed, I mean, you're carrying it like from
[SPEAKER_02]: birth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're literally giving it life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that plant is going to work with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I forget where I heard it,
but somewhere in Africa, where they grow
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, they say you have to grow your
own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: For it to be the best for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if somebody else grows it,
or if you steal it from someone or you
[SPEAKER_02]: take it or get it from someone,
it's not going to help you the same way as
if you grow the plant for you,
because that plant is working for you and
you are working for it.
And it's just a special bond.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, anyways, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So popping seeds is like, you're going to
find all these unique plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single plant you grow is going to be
something that nobody else has grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though it's the same strain or maybe
something stabilizing or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you have that individual child that's
your own plant and it's going to adapt to
[SPEAKER_02]: your environment immediately, start
expressing itself based on what you give
[SPEAKER_02]: it, including emotions actually,
but even just down to environment and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to find some really
special plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never really thought it was that fun
growing other clones, because I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, why do I want to grow the same
thing that the next guy has and the next
[SPEAKER_02]: guy and the next guy and 5,000 other
people also have this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like now I'm a little bit more open to it
because I think it's cool to see what that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is the same as seeing what any seed
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is another plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like let's see what's so good about it or
like looks awesome, smells awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of reasons to grow a clone
for sure, but growing seeds is just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's how all those clones came to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously they came from seed that someone
popped and you never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be the next person that pops a
seed, whether it's you popped one or 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might pop that next to the clone only
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing plant that everyone wants to grow
and smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't pop seeds, you'll never
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, looping back to a point you made
earlier on, you said that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really important to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the vibe of if you're going to use
someone else's work, like their vibe,
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that means that there's maybe
certain people's work who you wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to work with, but the flip side of
that is how would you feel if someone who
[SPEAKER_01]: you didn't really vibe with, they fell
into that category of you wouldn't work
[SPEAKER_01]: with their gear because you don't agree
with maybe personal aspects or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you feel if they then started to
incorporate your work into their gear?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, you know, would that tick you
off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it kind of just a part of the game?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would have to be okay with it
because honestly, I believe anybody should
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to do whatever they want with
whatever plant is in their possession.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if somebody wanted to breed with my
stuff, luckily everybody that's bred with
[SPEAKER_02]: my strain so far has been friendly with
me, which is really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've done some amazing work.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a stellar collision with D man
seeds and that was something we agreed
[SPEAKER_02]: upon, like grow these and breed with them
and we'll do this collab kind of thing and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few others out there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's some people that bred
with some of my stuff that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they didn't ask me, but I saw it
and I was just like, holy shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: that looks amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like thanks for choosing my strain versus
someone else's.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if somebody that I didn't like
bred with one of my plants, I'd probably
[SPEAKER_02]: like them a little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I wouldn't be mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd probably still be honored because it's
just like, you know, they like that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works for them and they're going to put
their own twist to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe they'll even make something that I
don't like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like maybe they'll put cookies into it and
I fucking hate cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like if somebody, you know,
they want to make their own version of
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, like let's say somebody wants to
make a pupil hybrid with some,
[SPEAKER_02]: with like an OG or cookies or something,
it's like, cool, do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I want to see what it comes out like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd probably still grow it out even if I
don't really like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I normally wouldn't grow plants from
people I don't like, but if there's like
[SPEAKER_02]: something really cool about it,
I can put things aside because I don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: I try not to have problems with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if they have a problem with me,
then maybe I'm not going to like them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So much, but it's pretty, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of love and seeing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to focus on all the positives all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in general, where do you sit on the
issue of say permission or good grace?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know you mentioned earlier that
you had the conversation with professor P
[SPEAKER_01]: is that kind of ideally how you would like
it to go down with if you were going to
[SPEAKER_01]: use someone else's work or like,
for example, let's just say you couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really get in contact with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you just kind of go ahead?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what would you be your protocol?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically the best case scenario,
of course, is one like that, where you can
[SPEAKER_02]: talk to the person who's bred the plant
you want to work with and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, do you mind if I do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I talk to them, I even say
like, yeah, these are going to be for sale
[SPEAKER_02]: at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might be sold as an F1, they might be
worth whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll explain them what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if they say that's okay,
then that's like the best case scenario.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they said it wasn't okay,
I wouldn't even do it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's other cases where you just
can't get in contact with the people or
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe it's something that's so used
already that you're like, fuck it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Gorilla Glue 4 is the only like elite
clone that I've bred with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was kind of like, all right,
I don't think they'll get mad at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's 700 different glue hybrids
out there already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I actually feel like I can make
something unique with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just gonna go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, Putin was another, he made a
pupil tangy hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, I can't get in contact
with the tangy dudes and people who don't
[SPEAKER_02]: even know what the hell tangy is,
because maybe they took California Orange
[SPEAKER_02]: and renamed it or, you know, there's that
whole tangy drama.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knows the exact truth behind what
they did and if they really made it or if
[SPEAKER_02]: they just have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, all right, the tangy is kind
of free range.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's breeding with that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's fine, but I definitely prefer a
lot to breed with anything from somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: that I can talk to that I know personally,
or that says like, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely the coolest way to do it
because then you just know that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's more good vibes in it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of my words with some of D-Man's
stuff, which I'm friends with him and I
[SPEAKER_02]: got to go to his place in Canada,
which was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he taught me stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so much, like a lot of my breeding
knowledge comes from him over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really, really cool to breed with
each other's stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just puts like an extra piece of
excitement in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you grow those plants,
it's like, you have a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_02]: connection with that person too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even if it's just in your head or
it's in the plant, like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: right now I'm growing some Mr. E pupils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Mr. E is a cut from East Coaster
Dam that he gave me to breed with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And growing those is so cool because it's
like, that's a super special plant that my
[SPEAKER_02]: friend held for 10 plus years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he gifted it to me that I could
breed with it because he wanted it to be
[SPEAKER_02]: available to other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, it's just that much more
exciting to see like my plants come
[SPEAKER_02]: together with his plants when we're both
friends and we both like our own plants
[SPEAKER_02]: and each other's plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's, there's a lot of good vibes
bounce back and forth when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborating like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just kind of in line with what you
just mentioned, what are some genetics you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't currently have access to,
but you'd love to work with and why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to check out some Colombian Golds
because I've never grown or smoked that
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've had it like in hybridized
whatever, but I haven't had this pure
[SPEAKER_02]: Colombian Gold yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vietnam Black.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just some different land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if I would necessarily breed
with them or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends like how outrageously finicky
they are or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because usually I tend to try to breed
with something that's like pretty stable
[SPEAKER_02]: off the bat is because it's available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like why would you not use something that
you like that's already pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I believe everybody should try grow
out the craziest plants that they heard of
[SPEAKER_02]: through their like old ass uncle or
whoever the hell is just like back in my
[SPEAKER_02]: day we smoke this and this and it came off
a boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you hear a story like that and
it speaks to you or it just sounds cool,
[SPEAKER_02]: like seek out that plant because it's not
as long gone as you might think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's somebody preserving every
single land race strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that stuff is just awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it can be really good
breeding too.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?
[SPEAKER_02]: As cheesy as it sounds, I'm finally
getting triangle Kush because I never had
[SPEAKER_02]: that clone before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, I don't usually grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't usually breed with clones,
but that's one that I'm really excited to
[SPEAKER_02]: explore the possibilities because every
single TK hybrid that I've smoked has been
[SPEAKER_02]: so, so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've grown a few and seen a whole
bunch of them growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, man, like it's a classic
and maybe it's a little overused,
but I think the star people put like a
unique touch to it.
And I think that'll be really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's coming up soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't want to tell people that,
but that's coming in a year or two if it
[SPEAKER_02]: works out well, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't think anyone's going to
look down on you for liking TK.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easily my favorite of all the Kush's
and it's just so solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, when I, when you smoke it,
you can understand why it's stood up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that in mind, are there any other
ultra clone only, you know, almost even
[SPEAKER_01]: borderline hype strains that you would
consider working with?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm checking a few out at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, how I got some clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of doing a run of like a ton of
clones just to see what I like actually
[SPEAKER_02]: out of all like these elites and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cause I recently ran into like a few
different people that are big on like how
[SPEAKER_02]: having all these elite clones and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just, yeah, you can have
whatever the fuck you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just like, all right, let's take in
a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't want to like tell people that
I'm going to breed with them or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: because chances are not gonna,
something really vibes with me,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm sure something will really vibe
with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be checking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got like so much lavender.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got 10 D I got supposed to become 91,
but it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm still looking for 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: 91 real one of that would cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm looking through some blueberry
clones, a purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't think it's supposed to be
very strong, but it smells really good and
[SPEAKER_02]: it looks awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe one day I'll hit that with some
heavy hitters, but probably not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I don't think I need to cause
usually when I'm breeding, I like to find
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff from seed from strains that I really
like already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then work with that just cause it's
more unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't want to create the same thing
that somebody next door can create like,
[SPEAKER_02]: or create something similar to like,
I don't want to make the next purple
[SPEAKER_02]: punter if there's already 30 different
purple punch hygrids out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather like sprout a bunch of seeds of
like anything and then find something I
like.
And I'd rather harmonize with that just
because nobody else has that phenome of
[SPEAKER_02]: that strain because I grew it from seed
and I liked it because of whatever reasons
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it for versus like, Oh,
it's that clone that you can pick up at
[SPEAKER_02]: the shop for 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, are you somewhat
kind of a guard full of your clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: given that, you know, you have gone
through work to find the individual ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you kind of have the mindset that,
you know, to keep your work unique and in
[SPEAKER_01]: that regard, you know, still valuable in
the consumer's eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to somewhat limit the
availability of the parents?
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually the only clone that I'm like
that with is the star pupil because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just such an amazing breeding card.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's just the world to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's an amazing, amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so nobody has that family members have
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in case I lose it, I can get it back,
but nobody else has that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter how much I trust them,
they just don't get it because then it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, everything else I like to share
because I'm really excited when I make a
[SPEAKER_02]: strain and then I find a really nice color
and it just represents exactly what it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy for people to grow that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, especially if they don't want to dig
through seeds, I'll be like, here,
[SPEAKER_02]: try this color.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the thing on the front page of my
catalog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is that grow it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to look just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to smoke amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to like, you don't even
have to dig through a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm happy to share those really awesome
plants that I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them are actually going to be
available soon through a few different
[SPEAKER_02]: clone exchanges.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're lucky enough, you'll be able to
pick up a cut of like Poo Tang,
[SPEAKER_02]: Amnesia Pupil, Rix Pupil, um, and then
others in the future as I let them out
[SPEAKER_02]: slowly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But usually like a few of my friends will
get just about everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even when I'm growing other strains
of whatever, like looking for moms and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, hunting stuff, I definitely pass
them off to friends so that if I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: get them back later, I can, or just like,
I know they're not going to get that far.
And if they do, it's fine.
Like if, if I don't want something out
there, I'm not going to let it out.
Like the star pupil clone, nobody has
that.
So I don't have to worry about it.
And then I can't get mad because nothing,
you know, nobody can do the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's just, I believe everything is
for every human, everything is your own
[SPEAKER_02]: fault.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever you do, what circumstances
you're in, like it's because of something
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're doing or whatever,
like to an extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want people to grow your own,
let people grow your clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't want people to breathe into
your clone, don't let people have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one of the most universal
truths I've learned from all the
[SPEAKER_01]: interviews is that when you give something
out, even just to one friend, it's out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, because I've been given clones
by people that are like, Hey, I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed to give you this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm going to die if anyone finds out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just don't tell anyone that you have
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm like, are you cool?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm like, all right, don't trust
that person with my clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would trust them with the clone
to the extent that I know they might give
[SPEAKER_02]: it to somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually that's fine with me, but if it
wasn't like that's your lesson right
[SPEAKER_02]: there, you just learned that like you
can't, you can't trust people because
[SPEAKER_02]: every single person's going to give you
some kind of secret or like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you tell somebody a secret,
they tell one other person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every person you tell a secret to,
you're telling 10 people, or like if you
[SPEAKER_02]: tell someone that you grow, like 10 people
find out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just along the same lines of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's not even a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a lesson that everybody should
just know about and you can compensate for
[SPEAKER_02]: it and make good decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we just loop back to a point you
made, you said you'd actually learned a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of things from D-Man over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: D-Man's well-known breeder for anyone who
hasn't heard of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually a little, he's
well-recognized within the scene,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think he's a little lesser known,
which is a little bit of a shame because
[SPEAKER_01]: he's been around for ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's where the question's actually
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that initially when you were learning
stuff from him, was that via like online
[SPEAKER_01]: forums and stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like were you around back then or was this
much more of like a personal contact?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little bit more recent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am on his forums, but we started
talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically I saw that he had Acapulco Gold,
which was like one of the strands that my
[SPEAKER_02]: mom had talked about from her day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a little before me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I never got to smoke it, like fresh
off the truck or wherever the hell it came
from in a brick, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, I saw that he had that and I
started talking to him and like somehow we
[SPEAKER_02]: just started talking to Boston and now we
just like text and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, like he taught me a whole
bunch of stuff because he was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're a little bit younger and
you're interested in like these strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: the land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everybody these days just wants like
OG push and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're here asking me about Acapulco
Gold and like growing my Panamas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, like we just got off to like,
we're like straight on the same foot right
[SPEAKER_02]: away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like vibes super well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was already like, you know,
I was growing and making seeds a little
[SPEAKER_02]: and telling him about those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I sent him some of my star pupil
swarms and he was like, dude, I hate
[SPEAKER_02]: purple weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you do not understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have something special here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I'm not wasting your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This shit is really strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not the same as most of the
purple shit that's just purple.
And that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is, this is something I want you
to try.
[SPEAKER_02]: He tried it and he was like, that's one of
the first purples that I really liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he ended up asking me if he could
breed with it because he liked it that
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he gave me stuff that I really liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I gave him stuff that he ended up really
liking too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of my favorite strains of all time
is his Panama powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a Panama red Landry's cross with
a F6 G13 black widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And holy shit, just I can't say enough
about how fucking amazing that strain is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's certainly been around for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It raises an interesting question in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although you just mentioned you got the
Panama from D-Man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you go generally if you are
looking to source these older genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you look to seed or just to kind of
acquisition of clone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely to seeds because I don't
usually take in many clones, like I said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I do, it's very rare for somebody
to be like, Hey, I got this clone of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, 1980s like tie stick or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I never see that in clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I did, I would take it for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if anybody's listening, maybe has some,
you know, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I'm usually digging through
seeds and just getting them from random
[SPEAKER_02]: ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like sometimes there's like a random
website in Denmark that has like all these
[SPEAKER_02]: cool land races and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them are recent and some of
them are really old.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got like some Jamaicans that are 1960
cross with 1985 over pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaican sativa, they're like 14 to 20
week flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just like somebody sent me a
link.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like, Hey, check out this
website.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have like all these cool things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the seeds are really,
really amazing because then even if you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't find a good plant, you can open
pollinate and then eventually find
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's like a little bit
reasonable to work with and go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it, it almost seems like you would
never get offered a clone of tie stick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tie, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I wonder if anybody has like,
people definitely have some, but I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's that common.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you gotta remember most of these
people are on the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in Europe, there's a huge,
I think I was actually talking to Kagu and
[SPEAKER_01]: he said there's in Europe, there's in
Spain specifically, there's people who
[SPEAKER_01]: have like some of the best land races on
earth and they hoard it and they do not
[SPEAKER_01]: want it to get out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially like, I always wonder when all
that shit went from here to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Netherlands and then it all became like
the same shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all those breeders, like they must
have original parental stock.
That's actually a little bit more unique
than the Watertown Dutch hybrids of today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like there's gotta be a lot of
unique stuff still flowing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like, I mean, the easiest example
you can point to is that Neville has said
[SPEAKER_01]: in interviews, he's still got lots of
stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet he has some amazing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know there's, there's like groups in
California and preservationists that have
[SPEAKER_02]: all these land races and they have clones
and seeds and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just don't give it out to
anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the one hand it's awesome that
they're preserving it, but I'm a little
[SPEAKER_02]: like, why wouldn't you share it?
Like, you know, how much this means to
people and like, it could be kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: fresh start for a gene pool for tons of
people that want to fuck around with it
[SPEAKER_02]: and try breeding a little or just preserve
it themselves too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't really, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand hoarding, but it gets tricky
when it's like, dude, you're hoarding like
[SPEAKER_02]: the last fucking seeds of this strain that
like, you could just let out people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, especially in seed forms,
like why wouldn't you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last pure building blocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it's so hard to find anything really
like pure these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something I did want it to ask is like
much of your work, it draws on strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: which might broadly be considered old
school in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like even Float, Evelyn,
Amnesia, Panama, was this an intentional
[SPEAKER_01]: decision or is it just kind of how it
worked out?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's just the plants that vibe
with me really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like a lot of the new school kind
of stuff that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I grow a lot of plants and a lot
of them never get to see the light of day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm just like, fuck this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll smoke it a few times and be
like, no, not my vibe next.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's mostly newer stuff that tends to
blend together as like the strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's usually because they have unique
effects or unique flavors or a combination
[SPEAKER_02]: of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think that it's possible to
through breeding with these old land races
[SPEAKER_01]: to kind of create the next slice bread,
like something that's really unique,
[SPEAKER_01]: really different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to kind of spur off its own
tree of lineage and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think that you can create
something unique, but it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have like the same impact as, you know,
if you created like skunk back in the day
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you definitely, you can change the
world with a single hybrid for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what year you're in.
You can do it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it 10 years from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know for me, like one
example would be Girl Scout Cookies,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a strain that I really don't
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you think about it, it's in so many
things right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, I could name tons of companies
that exist solely because of Girl Scout
Cookies, because their entire line is Girl
Scout Cookies crosses something,
crosses something.
So, for example, whoever popped that Girl
Scout Cookies seed, you know, is what the
real story is.
But there was a plant, people liked it.
People read with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's plain and simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if I make something with a
couple of land races in it and somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really likes it, or maybe it's a
clone that gets out that's like super
[SPEAKER_02]: exceptional, or maybe it's just seed stock
that people want to breed with.
It doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you make something good and special
that people like, then it's going to get
used in hybrid.
It's just like, you know, Chem Dog is in a
ton of things too.
And that's, it's just because people liked
it and that's about all there is to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like with cookies, it's not even
stable and people still like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you get so many urns off it,
but people like something about it and it
[SPEAKER_02]: made a big dent for there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that in mind, would you let a
plant, which was the next slice bread to
[SPEAKER_01]: you, but it happened to throw some nanos,
would that be like a red flag or would you
[SPEAKER_01]: just still go with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Keeping in mind what we just said about
cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: In what regard?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for example, whenever these seeds,
I make sure that they're pretty damn
[SPEAKER_02]: stable, that they're not going to hurt
them all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I test them and I have other people
test them in their environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hear back from them, like,
you know, I did this and this and this and
[SPEAKER_02]: it survived it and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I believe, first of all,
everybody should do some solid testing
[SPEAKER_02]: before releasing seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're saying that they're testers,
which is different, like freebies,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you can say, like untested
freebies.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I'm releasing seeds, I want to see
it stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the clone, I pretty much also want to
see it be really stable, because I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to give somebody a clone and then it
harms their garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, somebody's garden is
sometimes they're livelihood and it's all
they're just seeded and they can't make
rent the next month because they haven't
tossed everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not a good thing to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, you try to really minimize the
possibility of like hermene shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess the exception would be like
sterile nanos.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you prove that the nanos have no viable
pollen every single time and you try using
[SPEAKER_02]: that pollen to make a seed and make sure
then like maybe in a clone only kind of
thing, it might be fine.
Like I think Chem D, I was told is going
to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it'll probably harm, but there won't
be viable pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't worry about that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, in that case, it's totally
fine, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, it certainly feels like the
devil's kind of in the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was talking to Mean Gene about this
at the Emerald Cup and he kind of raised
[SPEAKER_01]: this interesting question, you know,
he said, what if you create a strand as a
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder and it's fire, like dead set,
the best thing ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like 50, you don't, it's only like 50%
of the phenos and the other 50% like
[SPEAKER_01]: Wilhelm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you work on it for a
generation or two or reselect the parents,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just seems to be the inevitable
outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what do you do in that situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how much better is this strain
than the next best strain that you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one solution that got thrown around
was like you offer it with that
[SPEAKER_01]: information out there and maybe at a
reduced price.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just one solution that got thrown
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually see him at triple the price with
no warning, but I see a lot of breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: putting out current packs of 300 bucks and
they don't even have the warning on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you hear it through people and then
you try it and you see it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, yeah, I think the right thing
to do is either you don't release it or
[SPEAKER_02]: you release it with that warning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And probably as a freebie with the
warning, like, I don't know, even if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really fucking good, you don't have to
sell it if it's going to cause problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would probably say don't sell hermy
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you have a warning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably just better not to because
somebody is going to trade that pack and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to lose the warning and the
next person is going to get fucked over
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's going to be mad at you,
the breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many other good plants that you
don't need to worry about crazy arm rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like as we're having this
conversation at Dawn's, let me have like
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is like, yeah, you probably shouldn't
sell hermy seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think about this idea of
breeders who release lines with new
[SPEAKER_01]: parents each cycle, whether it be due to
laziness or due to the fact that there
[SPEAKER_01]: could be some advantages to doing so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think any potential advantages are
offset by potential disadvantages or what
[SPEAKER_01]: do you think of that idea in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to do that, you just have
to tell people and you have to test each
[SPEAKER_02]: generation before you release it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say you're first, you make this
new strain and then you release it and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's the F1s and then the next year you
run out of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you make some F2s, like just tell
people that is F2s and then test those F2s
[SPEAKER_02]: and see like, okay, maybe there's a little
bit different things coming out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like explain that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem I have with a lot of seeds
is that there's zero information when you
[SPEAKER_02]: buy them from a lot of breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a name and the cross and
that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of sucks because I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to give out the information on my
strains that I would want to see if I was
[SPEAKER_02]: buying it from somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I'll put out as much information
as I can think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if people ask me questions,
I'll even add that to my description where
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, like on my website and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like try to be super thorough and I don't
know, just so people know what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're buying a certain strain and
then it's totally different from what you
[SPEAKER_02]: bought last year, but it's from a breeder
and it's because they use different
[SPEAKER_02]: parents, like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would want to know that it's version two
or version five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some, some readers have like a couple
versions of the same strain and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: labeled that and maybe there's not much
info, but at least you know, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, I grew me three last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm growing V5 versus like just
expecting the same thing where it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause no two parents are going to combine
the same header.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might be close, but definitely not
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you feel about F2s that get
sold, which then a kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy high pricing, because something I
hear people, which they say to me is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is there's a bit of a question mark over
the F2s in the sense that from a breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: point of view, it could be more ideal,
but from a consumer point of view,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably less ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause as you loosely referenced,
you're going to get things popping up,
[SPEAKER_01]: which probably not intended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, when you make an F1,
I don't think many people think about,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, so when I eventually make some F2s,
like I definitely want people to have one
[SPEAKER_01]: of these grandparent phenos popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just think it's a totally not a
thought that goes through your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the, the, the criticism I hear is
that, you know, effectively you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get less phenotypes, which you would
see in the F1s, which is probably what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then likewise, it's kind of like,
sometimes F2s can be done quite improperly
[SPEAKER_01]: with small selection pools and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how do you feel about the F2
offering in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: I never understood why people ask for more
money for an F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought it should be the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: F2 is like, okay, you got the lazy,
you didn't keep your parents and you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: recreate the same seat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're doing the next best thing you
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can look at it the other way and
say, you're taking the generation forward
[SPEAKER_02]: and doing more work and more selections,
which is also true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in that case, it kind of evens out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a plus and a minus, but it
really depends what your style is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you're trying to offer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like DMN likes to release F2s for almost a
preservation type reason where it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have more phenomes that are coming out
and there's a little more variety than the
[SPEAKER_02]: solid F1 where there's just like,
let's say two phenomes and four phenomes
[SPEAKER_02]: that are very tight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe your F2 will open it up a little bit
and offer more diversity, which in some
[SPEAKER_02]: cases is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in other cases, it is your worst
enemy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just depends what you want to grow and
why.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's room for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's room for super work lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's room for solid F1s that can be
reproduced by the breeder with the same
[SPEAKER_02]: parents every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's room for F2s and F3s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to use F2s sometimes in an F1
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make something, take it to F2 and then
cross that.
[SPEAKER_02]: F2, find what you're looking for in F2 and
just cross it.
[SPEAKER_02]: To another mother or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you can pull out some really
unique stuff that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know, there's just a reason for
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just depends what you're going for
and why.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you referenced the $300 packs
of seeds and I'm sure many people can
[SPEAKER_01]: think of even more expensive ones than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your position on seed pricing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that it should just be like a
capitalist thing where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: people set their own prices?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the market determines supply and
demand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think that there should be some
sort of, I don't want to say like pricing
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, but like essentially,
you know, you can't just go ripping people
[SPEAKER_01]: off with F1s versus maybe some other
project, which has got a lot of work being
[SPEAKER_01]: put into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you sit on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pricing is always tricky because
like you said, like you can price
[SPEAKER_02]: something and then just see if people buy
it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, in my opinion, the best thing to
do is like price fairly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever fair is to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously everybody has different
image of like what fair means.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for me, my prices had to go up like a
year or two ago because it just wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was working way too hard for what I was
getting and it wasn't quite adding up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just had to change it a little and I
felt bad even raising it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, we'll see how it goes and
put it a little higher and that will allow
[SPEAKER_02]: me to do everything that I need to do and
bring out some awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully people will be happy with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I saw people charging three or
five times as much as I was charging
[SPEAKER_02]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, all right, I don't feel that
badly.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what's fair to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This works for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will hopefully work for the people
that want to grow my strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least most of them can afford it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's just me though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like every breeder has their own vibe and
some people's vibe is like, let me charge
500 for this pack and only the people that
really want it can have it.
And like I understand that.
Like sometimes if I have something more
limited, it's almost on that kind of,
it's not going to be 500 bucks,
but it's going to be a little more
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive because there's so little amount
of packs that it's like, this is only
[SPEAKER_02]: going to exist one time and whoever can
get this, it's like your only little
[SPEAKER_02]: chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's just gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for whatever reason, like sometimes
there's a mom that you can grow a giant
[SPEAKER_02]: and you still get a very low amount of
seeds off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's just like, that this is what
you're left with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, or maybe you lost the clone and
it gets more rare because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can never make the seeds again or you
lost both parents and it's super out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the question or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if something is rare, maybe charge
more or something super.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you put a fuck ton of work into
something and you can prove it and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really awesome, like charge
whatever you want for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the only problem I have with seed
pricing is when stuff is expensive and
it's bad or it's unstable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's a couple of pretty well-known
breeders out there that are charging
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere from a hundred to a few hundred
bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their stuff is very loaded with
hermies all over the place and undesirable
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's, there's certain
ones that people just know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of people don't know,
but people that know know that you got to
[SPEAKER_02]: pop five packs and you find that one
keeper that looks like the photo and then
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to be your one that doesn't
hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hopefully from there,
it's good smoke if you're lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, well, I go through that
bullshit when you like spend 70 bucks on
[SPEAKER_02]: like a body pack and just, you know,
it's almost always something good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can definitely attest to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you're kind of hitting on a
point, which I really wanted to bring up
[SPEAKER_01]: because something that I've noticed
happens more often than not is that there
[SPEAKER_01]: are people, maybe shady is not the right
word, but as you described, charging a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: for things which shouldn't be priced that
high, especially given there may be
[SPEAKER_01]: hermies or things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are certainly lots of people
within the scene and the community who are
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of this and are aware of the types
of results you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more often than not, nothing gets said
because people don't want to rock the
[SPEAKER_01]: boat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that it's a bit of a mistake
that we're in this mindset?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because so often, you know, it just seems
like that's the case where people know the
[SPEAKER_01]: shady things that are going on,
but just no one says anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, that's such a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really tough because as a breeder
myself, I don't want to make enemies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even just as a grower, as a person who
likes to plant, I don't want to make
[SPEAKER_02]: enemies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that if I go call someone out
on their bullshit, that really quickly is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be like, all right, this person
doesn't like you, but guess what?
[SPEAKER_02]: All his friends fucking hate you too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, it becomes a war and
there's no time for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really tricky because.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best thing that I can do is just do my
best and try to encourage people like to
[SPEAKER_02]: see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, here's what I stand for,
and this is how I think things should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if somebody asked me directly,
like, do you have experience with
[SPEAKER_02]: so-and-so breeder or so-and-so strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell I'm like, yeah, it's all
Hermes, unfortunately, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tricky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think everyone should be as quiet
about it as they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do see people commenting once in a
while, but most people do stay quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's just because people are
scared of getting enemies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like, the more popular you get,
the more you don't want to have enemies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally stay out of drama whenever
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I feel really bad
for, like, the people who just don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're about to waste their money on
someone else's gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: As my own self, I can't be like,
hey, don't buy that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy my strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, mine's stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: His isn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that just looks shitty, so I'm not
going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough one to navigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, in general, how do you feel
about the state of our community in
[SPEAKER_01]: general?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at the moment, we're kind of at a
bit of a low point in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: internal drama.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think if you look back a couple
months ago, there was a lot of drama going
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like we're kind of, you know,
things are all pretty chill at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think this is things are better
this way, or did you think like that the
[SPEAKER_01]: drama generates necessary conversation?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably missed whatever drama you're
talking about, because I think there's
[SPEAKER_02]: certain people that need to be called out
that maybe haven't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not going to do it, especially
because I have no personal problems with
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of just seeing what people are
doing with everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think drama's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, people need to know
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know, everybody's in their
own kind of circles in their own zones and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people have a really wide scope
and view of like, what's going on with
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone and other people are like,
yeah, I only follow like this guy,
[SPEAKER_02]: this guy, and this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm cool with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's fine, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like, I don't I don't really
know what's the big picture, because I
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of stick like, who I vibe with
specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I usually ignore the drama,
just because like when there's drama,
[SPEAKER_02]: I do know there's always two sides to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, even if one of them is your friend,
and one of them is your enemy,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, they both have partial truths,
and you don't know where it sits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I'm going to stay out of
that personally, and just go by like,
[SPEAKER_02]: how that person's affected me directly or
what I see directly from them is taken
[SPEAKER_02]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the topics we love to chat about
on this show, the roadkill skunk,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, very elusive origins,
hard to pin down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's got some cool stories about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any experiences with the
roadkill skunk by any chance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: My opinion on the skunk is that basically,
like, there's everybody searching for the
[SPEAKER_02]: strain that smells just like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had it a couple times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've had different strains that
have that quality, whether one of them was
[SPEAKER_02]: actually called skunk, and a couple others
were just other strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And something interesting that I noticed
that I wanted to talk about with that was
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of times you get a bag of weed,
and it just smells like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's like before you even open it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it smells super skunky through the
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you open it, and you smell
it, sometimes it's totally different,
[SPEAKER_02]: which would also mean that when you're
growing it on the plant, it might totally
[SPEAKER_02]: not really smell like a skunk at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when you get it in the right
conditions, whether it's in a bag or maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: in a certain temperature or something like
that, then the skunkiness comes out more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like a lot of times that
skunk smell experience is like smelling it
[SPEAKER_02]: through a bag or smelling it from a
distance or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because recently somebody gave me some
bud, and I smelled it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I just smelled the bag that he gave
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even open it because it smelled
so strong through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was straight skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, this smells so
skunky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he looked at me like I was an idiot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I didn't know what I was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he's like, dude, take it out and
smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's totally butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's creamy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not skunky at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I opened it and I cracked it a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was so right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was completely different than when the
bag was sealed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just like only those skunk
turps were permeating through the bag or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's definitely a thing with the
skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's certain turpines that will
come out in certain conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can definitely be masked by other
ones when you're actually up close with
[SPEAKER_02]: the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I never had anyone really
suggest that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's got some good food for thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first thing that jumps to mind for
me is that it would almost indicate that
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe this skunky profile that people are
chasing is actually a more simplistic one,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you said, the bag is kind of
filtering certain, maybe more complex,
[SPEAKER_01]: just for whatever reason, turpines that
aren't making it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're looking for is actually
more of a simple profile than a super
[SPEAKER_01]: complex one per se.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it could be just a terpene that's like
one single terpene or maybe a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: combination that really permeates through
the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, like you said, it's holding in
all the finer, more complex ones,
[SPEAKER_02]: which may actually smell stronger once you
do get to them by opening the bag and
[SPEAKER_02]: smelling the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, yeah, that's definitely some food
for thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So did you ever smoke any growing up or do
you have any cool stories about anything
[SPEAKER_01]: you smoked while growing up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I got skunk one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what skunk it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just skunk when I got it from the
dude and it was just straight up.
That one smelled like a skunk even without
the bag, but especially through the bag.
Like I was trying to hide that smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know about glass jars yet because
I was just starting to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my hole everywhere, everywhere I went
with that thing just smelled like a skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: behind me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I got some cool stories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, this is a phone one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the first few times that I
smoked, it was back when like smoking was
[SPEAKER_02]: still an adventure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like not casual yet for me and my
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like, dude, I know this spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get some weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Albany with a couple of friends,
like staying for a weekend with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, you're not even going to
believe this, but I know where we can get
[SPEAKER_02]: this weed in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like this house that you have to
go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like kind of an apartment building
and then you walk down this hall and then
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a door and you like knock on the
door and it's called a knock knock house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dude sticks his fingers through
the thing and then he asks you what you
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, dude, that's so bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is not a real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically we went and he was like,
I know what street it's on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got to find the right house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we'll just try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like three of us went and we went
into this building.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yes, this is where everyone
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go in and then we knock on his door.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he opens the door and we just walk in
and we're just in this dude's kitchen and
[SPEAKER_02]: he's just like smoking a bong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're like, all right, yeah,
this must be it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we just like walked in some random
person's apartment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like not the right thing at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he just happened to be smoking weed
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're just like, oh, sorry,
I think we're at the wrong place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we went back in the hall and then we
went down the hall and found the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm dead serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like my friend knocked on the door
and this dude stuck his fingers through
[SPEAKER_02]: the mail slot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, those like horizontal mail
slot things.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yo, look inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the menu.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like three things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what the first one was,
but it was, it was like Miz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was green crack and the Miz
was 10 a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the green crack was 25 a gram,
which is the highest that I've ever paid
[SPEAKER_02]: for anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my buddy was just like, dude,
I hear the Miz spray with Windex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we can't get the Miz.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to get the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we, we just got into this green crack
and it was 25 bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just remember it so distinctly
because it was like some of the strongest
[SPEAKER_02]: smelling stuff ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was green with like these purple
streaks in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically we put it in his car and we
went around the city and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like when we were going back to
his car, we could smell it across the
[SPEAKER_02]: street and all his windows were up and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a single gram in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish somehow I could get that because
like the intensity of the smell was so
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we smoked it, like we all
just started freaking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all thought it was laced and like
they had smoked many, many times more than
[SPEAKER_02]: I had at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were just like, I think this
shit's laced, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I feel the blood rushing through my
veins, through my whole body and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just wild, but I've had a few
different times like that in New York,
[SPEAKER_02]: just getting like the most ridiculous weed
ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to this day, I mean, I don't know if
it was laced or not, but probably not
[SPEAKER_02]: because usually people don't lace weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something I wanted to bring up,
because I know that you do dabble in it is
[SPEAKER_01]: like Cobb LED lightings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you give us a little bit of a
rundown with your experience and any
[SPEAKER_01]: information you have to share?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically Cobb is a chip on board.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like these full spectrum LEDs with
the white light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see everything in like real color
and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw these videos on YouTube where
this guy was like, yeah, I get like 1.8,
[SPEAKER_02]: 1.9 grams per watt with these.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to build them yourselves,
but they're better than any lights you can
[SPEAKER_02]: get out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Build a light yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was super technical and all that,
but eventually I took the time to figure
[SPEAKER_02]: out what he was talking about and how it
all worked and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically he studied everything he was
saying and all kinds of things about light
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum for a couple of weeks with my
brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we developed like a really good
spectrum by like combining different chips
[SPEAKER_02]: and I built those light and I just started
using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so blown away because I've always
been, at least like the last few years,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been using LEDs because I like them a
lot more than HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always find like better, more unique
terpenes and just like less generic but I
[SPEAKER_02]: feel like the plant can express itself
better under LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when I switched to the cobs,
it was like, again, it was like a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: nother level of like just the plants
expressing to their fullest potential
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you would see stuff like outdoors,
you see pink hairs on some strains and
[SPEAKER_02]: then indoors you almost never see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then under the cobs I started seeing
that like everything was praying and
flowering a little bit faster and super
healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, I'm just super hooked on
the cob lighting because basically I
[SPEAKER_02]: chopped down a few plants under it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, you know, this looks
like X amount of like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a hundred grams, let's say, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like turns out to be like 200.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like every single time it's like double
what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like super dense, super heavy
yields and like the same or better quality
than it used to.
So I recommend to people try out the cob
lights.
They're just super crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I switched like almost all my fixtures
over to cobs in the last year or so after
[SPEAKER_02]: using that one for maybe a year or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend to people if they're growing
under cobs, make sure, or even any LEDs,
[SPEAKER_02]: keep your temperatures at like 82 degrees
because if you go lower than that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have like some nutrient
deficiencies that are basically,
[SPEAKER_02]: in short, it's related to leaf
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do with the whole spectrum and
what nutrients the plant needs a little
bit more of because of the spectrum.
And anyways, if you keep your
temperatures, like at least in the low
[SPEAKER_02]: 80s, you won't have any issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you keep them like 75, like HPS
temperatures, you're going to get like
[SPEAKER_02]: magnesium deficiencies and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something to consider.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just for like really good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome info.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you fiddled around at all with the
far red UV initiators at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are crazy actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I put those in too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically when I started flowering
with those, they would go on for like 15
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The lights go out and it simulates like
the sunset outside and it puts his plants
[SPEAKER_02]: to sleep faster and essentially it gives
them two hours more of darkness according
[SPEAKER_02]: to whoever built it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was pretty skeptical, but it was
scientifically proven by all kinds of
[SPEAKER_02]: whoever the hell studies it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so sure enough, it makes your plants
flower really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed that basically, I think it
was like day 14 looked like day 21 on like
[SPEAKER_02]: every plant in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did a whole bunch of different
strains in there and just everything
[SPEAKER_02]: flowered super fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically the initiation of flower
the first few weeks that go a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you really notice in a few days,
like, damn, these things are already
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like a week later, it's like
really, really flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I recommend those if you're trying to
speed up your cycle by like five to seven
[SPEAKER_02]: days or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's some awesome info as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And definitely for sativas, because some
sativas like, um, you know, 11 hours of
[SPEAKER_02]: light or 10 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know a lot of growers just want to
use 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do that and you're basically
giving them, you're still giving them your
[SPEAKER_02]: 12 hours of light, then you're giving them
the equivalent until like 14 hours in the
[SPEAKER_02]: dark or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cause they process the fact that it's
nighttime sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in regards to your flowering cycle,
then besides the cobs and the fire red
[SPEAKER_01]: initiated ship, do you do anything outside
of the norm when you're in flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I've always for the last few years
have been flowering under 11 hours of
[SPEAKER_02]: light and then 13 hours of dark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I heard it from DJ short who said
like, yeah, we'll kind of make your plants
[SPEAKER_02]: be a little bit more more sativa in
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you're growing into cause it will
kind of give them a little energy,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little kick to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that was interesting because
it's kind of more of a tropical light
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle and that's where the plants evolved
to these more sativa phenotypic
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I basically tried to side by side with
a couple of clones and one really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: thing was that this, um, it was quite a
per city OG from Moxie, which I only grew
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of times, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under 12 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are both under the same
temperatures under 12 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was totally green and it smelled like
super generic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like nothing memorable,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like under 11 went totally purple
with like just insane, like really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really nice smell and color and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, damn, that's the same
clone in like the same, just about the
[SPEAKER_02]: same environment, just different light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really improved the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it went a few days faster and
flowered.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like the same kind of ripeness on
the tricones and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was like my first, um,
first time seeing that like, damn,
[SPEAKER_02]: this light cycle thing makes a difference.
And they both yielded very similar.
Like a lot of people are scared.
They're like, oh, we're not going to lose
yield.
And I think that might depend on what
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like maybe some plants will like it more
and some won't, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been flowering under 11 hours and
combined with the cause of seeing over two
[SPEAKER_02]: grams per watt type of yield.
So I don't think it really reduces yield.
Um, but I definitely noticed that a lot of
what I grow is very like uplifting,
[SPEAKER_02]: even when I grow into, because it's pretty
functional and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I do like growing every day under
11 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I veg under 17 because the best
cycle has the same effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of, it's going to kind of like
make your plant evolve over time,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, whatever conditions you keep a
clone in, especially if it's for many,
[SPEAKER_02]: many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like if you're doing 24 hours versus
18 or 17, it's just going to, the plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to shift ever so slightly just from
being in a different environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So outside of that legendary green crack,
did you ever have any other cuts which
[SPEAKER_01]: left a lasting impression in your mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was, um, this one time I
smoked a split of white widow and I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: usually mix with tobacco, but once in a
while I would back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually I liked the thing that Bodhi
said about mixing cannabis and tobacco
[SPEAKER_02]: where it kind of gives you that grounding
effect and like that masculinizing effect
[SPEAKER_02]: towards like a feminine plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once in a great while, if you smoke a
split, it can be super, super therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, it was this white widow,
smoked a new split.
And I just remember like, as soon as we
were done smoking it, we were in the
[SPEAKER_02]: woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just sat down on the ground,
didn't talk for like half an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just like one of the most
psychedelic smokes that ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's funny because, you know,
white widow is like the pretty common
[SPEAKER_02]: strain, I guess, like in the commercial
field, whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but it's never really that good these
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this white widow, I smoked it a couple
of times, but this first time I smoked it
[SPEAKER_02]: especially, it was always so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, I just remember like not being
able to read like letters and shit because
[SPEAKER_02]: it was just like, I don't know,
it's just like this whole different head
[SPEAKER_02]: space that was so foreign.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, it wasn't even uncomfortable
that I couldn't read anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like every letter was a
picture and like super, super trippy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, like I've grown white widow
and I've smoked white widow since then
[SPEAKER_02]: from plenty of places and plenty of
different seeds and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just never found a white widow that
came close to that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was, it wasn't that long ago,
that white widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it was probably eight years
ago or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe nine years ago, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the white, where's a good white
widow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd like to know that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, all the other ones I've smoked
lately either put you to sleep or they're
[SPEAKER_02]: super bland and like not really much
flavor or much effect, just like regular
[SPEAKER_02]: ass weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I smoked some white rhino a while back,
not that long back, probably about a year
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fuck it was good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It like wasn't the same in a lot of ways,
but there was a lot of aspects of it that
[SPEAKER_01]: reminded me of smoking skelly in the
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just such a mind blowing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: No way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love when you just get something that's
like, even if it's not the same,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like close to something you had in
the past that was so reminiscent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like just amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bring it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we kind of jump to a slightly
related topic, but a little bit off field
[SPEAKER_01]: living in Massachusetts, what's it like
with the medical laws there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know things have changed
recently, but for the longest period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time, people had always said that it was,
you know, it wasn't the most friendly
[SPEAKER_01]: state to be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: How have you found it and how does it look
for you going forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely less chill than some
places and it's a lot better than a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm super, super grateful to be where
I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this time, like it's a relatively
safe environment to do what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it's a little scary and there's
all this, you know, it's definitely not
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like at our weed events, you can't have
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's seeds and stuff, but like we're
doing an event at CannaCon, which is like
[SPEAKER_02]: this event in Boston.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, yeah, you can't bring
flower to display.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I wanted to bring a little branch of
star pupil flowering and print water so
[SPEAKER_02]: people could smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see what it's like.
And they're just like, you absolutely
cannot do that.
You can't give away, but you can't
display, like no THC allowed.
And I'm like, okay, fine.
Like whatever, you know, it's not the end
of the world, but in that kind of sense,
it's a serious environment here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it makes sense because to me,
Massachusetts, at least the area I'm in,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a lot of people that don't like weed
and it's a miracle that we have weed
[SPEAKER_02]: legalized here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm pretty grateful for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the whole thing and our medical
programs, like better than some places,
[SPEAKER_02]: although it's not the best, it's
definitely not the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me it's like wherever in the world
you are, you adapt.
[SPEAKER_02]: You either move or you adapt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever works for you, you work with
it or you find a way and our whole
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization thing is like a huge mess
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so something I wanted to ask you was
that we don't see you at a stack of
[SPEAKER_01]: events.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you know, obviously you just
mentioned the CannaCon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this more of a geographical location
issue or are you just not so into like the
[SPEAKER_01]: high times and all that stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually I've been to a bunch of events,
but I don't usually, I don't want to show
[SPEAKER_02]: my face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as I don't know, I'm the overly
paranoid person because I learned from
[SPEAKER_02]: people that grew in like total prohibition
and I learned from the books that teach
[SPEAKER_02]: you like the craziest ass way of staying
safe so you don't get caught.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even like meeting people from
online, I never met anyone until a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of years ago because I was so scared that
like the first person I meet is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be that agent that's going to take me away
forever from my family and possessions and
[SPEAKER_02]: just like fuck up my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's still a transition of being like,
realizing like things are okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can talk to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was scared as hell to do this
interview, but I so badly want to like
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about all these things that I love.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I don't know, things are,
things are safer than I thought,
[SPEAKER_02]: but at the same time there's always that
risk because it's like everything in
[SPEAKER_02]: Massachusetts and in this country is just
gray area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all like, you know, everything on
Instagram you see these people posting
[SPEAKER_02]: selfies with like 5,000 plants behind them
and they're like, this is my full name and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm growing 5,000 cannabis plants and look
how awesome I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like only so many people can do
that before one of them just gets like
[SPEAKER_02]: taken to jail, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm like, what the fuck are you guys
doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this shit's a little sketchy,
don't you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of why I've been more private
the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I've been a little
uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the whole like how public can you
really go before like something bad
[SPEAKER_02]: happens to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so moving forward, do you think you
will be a bit more out in the open or are
[SPEAKER_01]: you just kind of going to still kind of
take care of yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm pretty private myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a pretty small circle of people and
then I'd like to be at more events and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually, when I go to events,
it's usually just like there's a couple of
specific people I want to meet that are
either at the event or going to the event
as like a person going to the event.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, you know, like someone on
Instagram, it's like, yeah, we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: talking for a year.
Like we should like go and go into this
event.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll usually go to events and do that
like in private, but I'm not like wearing
[SPEAKER_02]: a huge red flag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, hey, I'm Mass Medical Strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last couple of events,
like some people started coming up to me
[SPEAKER_02]: and be like, hey, Mass Medical Strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh shit, people are learning
who I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm scared, but it's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely would like to be more public
because I like talking about plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing all these good things and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like a lot of good stuff,
but just got to stay safe at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the last question about
Massachusetts, do you have access to labs
[SPEAKER_01]: and the testing facilities that people in
say California or Colorado have access to?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you utilize them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the value in it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you can just go to the lab and
bring your weed there and test it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like within a few days and you don't have
to tell them who you even are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can, I put Mass Medical Strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to give an ID or my real name
or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, they just put it
online and they email it to you or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you want them to do, but it's
super relaxed in that sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can learn a lot about your growing and
your strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the effects a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, effects are more subjective and
experiential, but you can still get some
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting numbers out of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, like you grow
something and you're like, why does this
[SPEAKER_02]: smell like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has this terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, what does this
terpene do medicinally?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, oh shit,
it boosts memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no wonder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the strain always like really helps
me when I need to think or remember shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, that's why.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can kind of learn a little bit
more about the plant through the lab
[SPEAKER_02]: results sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then other times, I mean, I've had
really strong shit test out at like 10,
[SPEAKER_02]: 15% on occasion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's more to it than lab
results at the same time, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really awesome in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something I love to talk to everyone
about clone deterioration or genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: drift, however you want to term it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you believe in it or do you think it's
just, it's just poor maintenance?
[SPEAKER_02]: So all my clones pretty much get treated
the same and I treat them pretty well
[SPEAKER_02]: overall, like, you know, keeping them
healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I always take extra clones and
just keep the healthiest rooted one,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, some pretty good cloning
practices and keeping it in a nice
[SPEAKER_02]: environment as best as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've noticed most clones stay the
same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, when you grow a clone
differently, you're going to get slightly
[SPEAKER_02]: different expressions off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you can get really something
different off it if you change something
[SPEAKER_02]: drastically.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then if you go back to what you're
doing before, it goes back to how it grew
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not really changing anything,
just flowering different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the other hand, I had a cut of
the Evelyn and every single time I grew
[SPEAKER_02]: it, it was a completely different plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time it was almost entirely green.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time it was like totally black.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time it was red and one time it was
purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a little different smells
coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like every generation that I grew
it, it just changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't the environment changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just maybe it getting older or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a friend of mine said,
oh yeah, like all the stuff I've grown
[SPEAKER_02]: from that breeder does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That genetic line, like they just change
over time as clones.
And so I think genetically there's certain
plants that may drift over times because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not expecting to live for multiple
years because usually campus outside will
[SPEAKER_02]: die in the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So especially like, I don't know,
I would assume something that originates
[SPEAKER_02]: from like a more tropical, not tropical,
like a more like cold ass climate where it
[SPEAKER_02]: would never have the chance to live a year
and then it lives a year and might start
[SPEAKER_02]: doing some weird shit versus other plants
that they don't really care.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then if you keep a clone in sheet
condition, unhealthy, whatever problems,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it can deteriorate, but I think you
can also revalidate it for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you know how to grow
organically, it's pretty easy to bring it
[SPEAKER_02]: back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just grow it healthy for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put it outside in the sun for like
a month or two and then take clones off it
[SPEAKER_02]: and bring it back inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously make sure it doesn't have
any bugs that you're going to bring in,
[SPEAKER_02]: but does sun really does wonders for
rejuvenating cuts when you need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really like, if I get a clone and it's
grown synthetically and like, let's say it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes in some soil or whatever,
and I know there's salts in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I'll grow it for a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll transplant it up to like some organic
soil, but the salts are already in there
[SPEAKER_02]: to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, I'm going to grow it big and
then take some new clones, grow those
[SPEAKER_02]: totally organically and then I'll flower
it so that it's kind of cleaning up and
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of getting towards my growing style a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like at the same time, it's adapting
to my LED and my little bit warmer grow
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you referenced not bringing any bugs
inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that were to happen, what would your
IPM treatment or go-to regime be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much beneficial creditors have been
the best thing that I've ever used.
Like I used to use Asimax in a veg because
it was supposed to be organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now they came out saying like,
yeah, there's also these banned pesticides
[SPEAKER_02]: secretly in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I stopped using that real
quick and I was like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But luckily I had only used that veg
because in flower you never want to spray
[SPEAKER_02]: anything.
Like even foliar sprays in flower,
like you're going to smoke that at the end
and people don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyways, basically my number one IPM
is like, I generally don't take in clones
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't go in my room unless I'm
clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I usually take care of the gardens in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just take a shower before I go in
and I'll leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have like a garden outfit that I'll
wear for like a couple of weeks at a time,
[SPEAKER_02]: like just when I go in there and then I'll
change out of it and like keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, just don't go in there.
Like if you've been in a grow or if you've
been outside, even like if you've touched
[SPEAKER_02]: any plants, like, dude, there's got to be
some, some eggs on your skin or some shit
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to like fuck up your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just stay super clean when I go in
there so that I don't have to spray
[SPEAKER_02]: anything and I don't have to constantly
buy predator bugs to take care of issues.
And then, you know, sometimes something
will come in, I'll get like some thrips or
[SPEAKER_02]: aphids or whatever and you can get these
predator bugs that will eat them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they literally eat all of them until
they're super gone and you won't see them
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just the best because there's
no chemicals involved at all and it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: most natural way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing that happens outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just as a little point, I wanted to
add in there, I've heard a few people
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I guess, like they're undertone in
their voices.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're being critical of predator mites
and they're like, yeah, but what about
[SPEAKER_01]: like the predator mites pooing and stuff
like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing I wanted to quickly point
out is that the predator mites largely are
[SPEAKER_01]: not on the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on the leaves and you don't,
you don't smoke those really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount they poo is minimal because
they bio convert into like recreating
[SPEAKER_01]: babies instead of pooping heaps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, just a little FYI for anyone out
there who's wondering, cause that's
[SPEAKER_01]: something I always hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, aren't you just like solving
one problem, but it's like causing the
[SPEAKER_01]: same problem in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, not really,
but anyway, just to jump to a bit of a
[SPEAKER_01]: different topic, what do you think will be
some of the future varieties and or
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors that are going to storm the scene?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you try to predict that to a
certain extent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, imagine if you had made Poo
Tang back when Tangi had first came out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you can only assume that it
would have rid that wave of popularity a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you actively think about that at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, cause honestly, like, even though I
release seeds for people to grow and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, I'm pretty much just breeding for
myself and what I want to make and what I
[SPEAKER_02]: like and think is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't really know what's out there
sometimes for weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there was a lot of times like I'll go
like half a year or a year without smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: like anybody else's weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at one point I'm like,
what is weed supposed to be like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, let me get some weed from somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like make sure I'm still doing a good
job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't even know anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what other people's weed is like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times I'm in my own world with
that just because there's not that many
[SPEAKER_02]: organic growers out here that I know
personally, at least so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like with the scene and all that,
what they want, I don't really know what
[SPEAKER_02]: the fuck they want, because I feel like
the people that seek out my like really
[SPEAKER_02]: unique strains or they're kind of land
race based, like there are people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for something different than the
norm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, I mean, people that are looking
for star people, they just want purple
[SPEAKER_02]: weed that gets them high and that's tasty
and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I don't know, I feel like I have
something for just about everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's part of why I've read with the
glue at one point was because like I knew
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a way to improve it and a way to
kind of use something popular and good
[SPEAKER_02]: that people want to like put my own twist
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So usually I just kind of make what I want
to see, because I don't know, like when I
[SPEAKER_02]: go to a dispensary, it's all this like
most of the menu is stuff that I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just don't go there and just like
this is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really like gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't smoke cookies because it just has
bad reactions.
[SPEAKER_02]: My physiology, I just freak out when even
if it's in a cross, like my body's just
[SPEAKER_02]: like, no, don't smoke that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've learned after 15, you know,
different cookies crosses that like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, it just doesn't vibe with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't smoke that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a big variety of what's out there,
just don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just smoke what I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, if I hear something cool,
like, oh shit, like this grower just grew
[SPEAKER_02]: like an old school haze or like some wacky
hybrid of like Nigerian something.
I'm like, dude, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll try some of that, but I'm not
going to go try like wedding cake or some
[SPEAKER_02]: crap like something, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just not for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though it's the trendy stuff right
now, but most of the trendy stuff is like
[SPEAKER_02]: not what I'm into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't know why, but this just
springs to mind just kind of loosely
[SPEAKER_01]: referencing earlier on when you were
talking to D man and saying this,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, star people is not like other
purple weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you ever consider doing like a star
purple, a star people, sorry, cross to
[SPEAKER_01]: like a purple strand, like, you know,
an Urkel or a granddaddy purple,
[SPEAKER_01]: like just for the lols.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a little thing in the
works right now with that, cause I found a
[SPEAKER_02]: purple that I really liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Spector, he sent me a bunch of his
Mendo F1 to work with and it's a Mendo
Perfz cross with his Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were really, really unique
because to me, at least they did not smell
[SPEAKER_02]: like a purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also grew like some Mendo Perfz S1s just
to get an idea of like the Mendo Perfz
cause I hadn't grown the clone,
but.
I got an idea for that, but then I grew
out the F1s, which were the regular seeds
with the Paki cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really liked them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, damn, this is another purple
that like, you know, it gets you actually
[SPEAKER_02]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a really unique effect for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't go in the grow room when I
smoke it, which kind of sucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what would happen is the lights was
fucking do the strobing thing in my vision
[SPEAKER_02]: whenever I would smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, it was
uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, like, dude,
give that to people that want to party and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to love you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it really like fucks with
your vision, that's like a unique effect
[SPEAKER_02]: versus just like a normal high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like if there's something more to it
and the flavor was really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was having so much trouble describing
it, but it was a really, really bright.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't much of a purple smell until I
cured it for like two months, but it was
[SPEAKER_02]: really bright and like, I don't know,
creamy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though it was a little tiny dash of
lemon in the background and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it just smelled like the
color white for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like didn't smell like the color
purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are really, really cool plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like this and they're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: They look a little like star pupil,
although the flower structure was very
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had the same kind of purple that starts
in the center and it's just purple the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked pretty similar.
And it had its own unique leaf structure
that I hadn't seen in other stuff.
So it was just like, this is unique enough
to cross with the star pupil and just see
[SPEAKER_02]: what purple craziness comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now I'm flowering a few of those
out and somebody's phenohunting like a
hundred of them.
So I'm going to see what comes out of
there and grow a few more of them and
hopefully that'll be a release in the
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to call it the Balladictorian if
it's as good as I expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would be your advice for an
aspiring breeder?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's a fun one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love when people want to breed
because like breeding is a huge part of
growing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It always has been just cause like I
always end up just like making a little
[SPEAKER_02]: few seeds on the side while I was growing
stuff for smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a really important part
of growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to breed, I think you should
have a goal to start with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that goal just has to be a vision of
like what type of plant you want or what
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to see happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you have like two strains you
like, and you just think like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what if I combine this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's a goal already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're thinking you're getting
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you have to have a reason to do what
you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just like, all right, I picked up
these 10 clones and like I popped a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: out of a packet pot and it's a male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just hit everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's not the way you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have a little bit of a goal and
then a little bit of a plan how you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to like do these and choppers is
doing a shitty job, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, I tell people like usually like
grow some plants that you know you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you buy a pack of seeds from
breeder and you like that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say even you pop half the pack and
you like them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've found that they're all pretty
similar and they smoke good and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, damn, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have like this female of this
other strain that I really like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I see them matching up nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this one has this trait and this one
is that trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it'll combine good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you know, maybe revisit those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe buy another couple packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buy another couple packs if you can afford
it.
And like look through all the males and
find a male that you can cross with your
other female of a different strain that
you think will work well.
And then don't just be like, all right,
I'm done.
Like grow them out.
Don't just grow one.
Grow like as many as you can and give them
to people to grow because you're not going
to be able to grow probably all of them.
You know, you're probably going to be able
to grow however many fit in your grow
room.
But if you can pass them out to 10
friends, you're going to start seeing
what's really in there, what you created.
And to me, there's like nothing more
beautiful than combining two plants and
then growing them out and seeing that
combination like that you did and seeing
like, oh shit, like there's the benching
and the smell from the star pupil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's like the overwhelming
sativa effect from the amnesia haze and
[SPEAKER_02]: the flowers are purple, but now they're
smelling like haze, but the stem rose
[SPEAKER_02]: smells like pupil and blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like super fucking exciting when
you're growing out your crosses and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: just seeing the best traits of all plants
that you found and put into that cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing I would say is like,
research the genetic background of your
[SPEAKER_02]: strains and take some time to learn which
strains have hermy tendencies and which
[SPEAKER_02]: don't, because sometimes like,
I don't know, you might find something
[SPEAKER_02]: that you like as a plant and you don't
realize like three generations back it has
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just because the F1 cross you got was
stable when you grew it doesn't mean that
there's hermy disaster.
There's waiting to happen in your next out
cross because chances are that's what's
going to happen if you work with sketchy
things sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know, doing some research
behind everything, like learning the
[SPEAKER_02]: lineage really helps you get a feel for
the plant and kind of expect what you
[SPEAKER_02]: might find, especially if you dive deeper
into more generations and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to look at like seed finder is
a pretty good website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I know some people say like they're
not that accurate, but a lot of their
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff's accurate and then go to a second
or a third source and see if it matches
up.
And if you know the real lineage of your
strain based on like how many people say
[SPEAKER_02]: what, hopefully you know what's in it at
least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's all wrong, but usually you can
get a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And find the plants that vibe with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't create what you think people want to
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Create what you want to see because I
don't know, people sometimes people maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: even lack the confidence to know that like
their opinion matters just as much as like
[SPEAKER_02]: some famous ass dudes opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're equal people, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want something, do it and create
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're the only one that likes
some weird ass tree, read for that weird
ass tree and make it.
And you're going to find people that love
it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to be really happy
because they thought they're the only ones
[SPEAKER_02]: that wanted that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like some good plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your thoughts on breeding with a
mother that was originally a feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: seed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, this is a fun one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll tell you right now, it does not
matter if your plant came from a femur or
[SPEAKER_02]: reg seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It matters that exact phenome,
that plant that you're dealing with,
[SPEAKER_02]: how stable it is and how stable it is in a
cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's plain and simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have a really nice mom from a
regular seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on whatever genetics are in
that, it might not be good for breeding or
[SPEAKER_02]: it might be awesome for breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same goes for a femur seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be super stable when you breed
with it or it could be super herby.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I tell people do a run with your moms
or stress test the hell out of them and
[SPEAKER_02]: see who croaks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like talk with your lights in
the middle of the night to turn them on
[SPEAKER_02]: for a little for like half an hour,
like every couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: During flower, like if you can fuck with
your temperatures, like just shut your
[SPEAKER_02]: heat off or shut off your AC and let it go
wild for like a few days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I don't know, maybe let them
almost die for like not watering them and
[SPEAKER_02]: then water them like just enough that they
bounce back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do all kinds of weird shit, like just as
a test to see how stable your plants are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually once you've done that,
like you have at least a much better
[SPEAKER_02]: chance that they're going to out cross
well because they seem to be stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's not always the case,
you definitely just have to grow at
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever cross you make.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's no secret that the Amnesia pupil,
the Amnesia haze came from a fem seed,
[SPEAKER_02]: from royal queen seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was not planning on breeding with
it, but I just found this amazing phenome
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was like, fuck it, let's see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was totally expecting it to be like
some sketchy ass hermy cross because it
[SPEAKER_02]: was a fem seed, but they all came out
super stable and super amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that mom was a really, really good
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was so, so vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't matter that it was from a fem seed,
it was insanely vigorous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a lot of good things come from fem
seeds and I see a lot of good things come
[SPEAKER_02]: from like seeds too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can definitely attest to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in regards to being more of a well
established breeder these days,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you find that there's any difficulty in
dealing with multiple seed banks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there at times where you wish you were
just going through one or do you kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like being able to spread your work out a
bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like being able to spread it out because
for whatever reason, like customers seem
[SPEAKER_02]: to have their own preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some growers are just like,
when's it coming to Neptune?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, dude, it's at this seed bank
and this seed bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you want it, go get it before it's
gone because it's limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, I'm going to wait till
Neptune gets it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like, I'm going to wait till the East
coast gets it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they're not even like
locally from that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like where they prefer to shop
for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of cool to spread them out to
different places and different people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, some of the seed banks
are close friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like they, in my book,
they come first, like they first dibs on
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the people who take like a month
to answer me, like it's their fault if
[SPEAKER_02]: they miss a drop or something,
but people are just going to get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's kind of first come first serve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I reach out to every company and tell
them like, all right, these are coming
next.
And then get them if you want them.
Don't get them if you don't, but this is
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I try to like tag the seed banks
that only have this training when it's
[SPEAKER_02]: available and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to keep track, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes I just tag them all and I'm
like, just look through them and see if
[SPEAKER_02]: you can find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So onto our last question before the short
fire ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who is someone, cause you mentioned
earlier, you've done some collabs before,
[SPEAKER_01]: but who are some breeders who you would
love to do a collab with going forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: And more importantly, how would you
logistically envision the project go down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you want it to be like, you select
one parent, they select the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: or how would you want to do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely would love to do a collab with
Bodhi just because I find that he vibes,
[SPEAKER_02]: I vibe with him, like with his whole
philosophy and his way of doing things and
[SPEAKER_02]: his vision of the plant and kind of,
yeah, pretty much he's one of my favorite
breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would like to do something with him
if he was down for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, I've bred with some of his
work before, so I would love to see him
[SPEAKER_02]: breed some of mine and it could go any way
that works, you know, like send him a cut
or send him seeds to hunt through and
then, you know, maybe hit it with one of
[SPEAKER_02]: his males in his own program or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe he'd send me something special to
work with.
And then, you know, same with any other
breeder if I was going to collab,
like something like that.
Like right now, I didn't even really
realize how it was a collab, but I sent
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon's Flame a phenom of D-Man's Panama
Powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then D-Man was like, yeah,
he can breed with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah, he can breed with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden I was like,
oh shit, we're collaborating, aren't we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I talked to him a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a cool dude with like some really
unique things going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he does really, really large hunts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's got some awesome selections for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now he released this Pan Dragon,
which is basically it's a collab of the
three of us because I hunted the Pan of
the Powerhouse that D-Man bred and Dragon
[SPEAKER_02]: Flame crossed it with his Dragon Stache
male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stuff like that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then who else did I want to work with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely more so with D-Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really impressed with his Stellar
Collision, which was a star pupil crossed
[SPEAKER_02]: with Power Load.
And that shit was a Power Load,
dude.
It was fucking strong.
I was so surprised at just like how
ridiculous those plants were, like these
huge baseball bats.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it was potent too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, damn, you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really nice.
So collab's always fun.
I'm always open to it.
Like any breeder that vibes with me,
I don't know, they pretty much have to not
[SPEAKER_02]: like cookies and then they're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the one rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like people that grow organically and
have a decent sense for the plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty respectful.
And I don't know, I think the vibe just
has a lot to do with everything and the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding practices too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all follows through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on to our last set of questions,
the quick fire ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Firstly, what is your favorite strain at
the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: It totally depends on my mood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either star pupil, Panama powerhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. E is a go-to because it's always
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm like super anxious, I'll just smoke
the Mr. E and I never get too,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always just like perfectly grounded,
but at the same time it's pretty damn
strong.
So that's a really special plant too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are like my top three at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now to get a bit more specific,
favorite strain of all time, only one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to go with my baby star pupil
because that thing is, it's just too
[SPEAKER_02]: special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's brought me on so many journeys and
brought me so much happiness.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to so many other people too,
it's just like super good vibes all
[SPEAKER_02]: around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somehow I never get bored of it
growing it like so many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess that's the one, but there's a
lot of close seconds for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So conversely on the other end of the
spectrum, what's the strain which just
[SPEAKER_01]: least jived with you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's definitely girl scout cookies and
I'll elaborate on that because I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want people to just like not understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically it's like the strain that to me,
when you hit something with the girl scout
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies, it just becomes cookies.
And obviously we'll have like different
expressions based on what you process with
a little bit, but like I always can pick
out the cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in one toke, I can just taste it or
just smelling the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just, so cookies are very
dominating strain to me, even when it
[SPEAKER_02]: seems not to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I can just pick it out and it's
not just that it hurts and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I physically can't smoke it
personally because like it gives me this
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy depression, anxiety, like bad head
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes through in the process too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever reason, like I don't like that
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to make it worse, like everybody
started breathing with it and putting it
[SPEAKER_02]: in everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I swear it's like bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every other plant I see in my explore page
is like, Hey, that looks good,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it kind of looks like cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I click on it and it's like
something, something cookies or something
[SPEAKER_02]: process, something cross cookies in the
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's so many breeders using it and
it makes it so that I can't smoke half the
[SPEAKER_02]: weed that's out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I try to be open-minded.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have a bad time every fucking
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was two cookies, there was two
cookies crosses that I liked out of I've
[SPEAKER_02]: documented at least 15 that I've tried,
but I've probably tried more than that
[SPEAKER_02]: because I don't usually write down when I
smoke shit, but I've smoked a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies and I only like two of them ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like pretty far out crossed
in the ones that I liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like fucking up the G pool
really bad because I don't know,
cross anything into everything.
And then you lose diversity and you can
never get it back fully because it's in
there.
It's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine there was a GMO strain and
everyone was like, fuck GMOs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like if every other strain had
that in there, it would be a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me it's contamination and it's
simply a strain that I don't like.
And I appreciate it.
I respect the fact that people do like it
because for a lot of people, the girl
scout cookies is like good medicine or
it's a good point or whatever they like
about it.
And I completely respect that because
whatever my favorite might be could be
their favorite.
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everybody has their own body and
everything works differently for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I respect the plant, but I feel like
it's way, way overused and it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: causing problems and breathing and then
diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like when you go to dispensary,
every strain is like the same thing when
[SPEAKER_02]: it's three quarters of them are just a
cookie's cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the one you think isn't a
cookie's cross, you look it up and it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a thorough answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could only grow one land race
strain for the rest of your life,
[SPEAKER_01]: which one would it be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's tricky because first I went to
Panama and then I was like, dude,
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes Panama is way too strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this for my whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to go crazy if I only smoke
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, can I grow other strains on
the side to balance it out?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn, that's super tricky because like
that's the favorite of mine, but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: too strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, like I need something more
mellow that I can chill with so that I can
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it like whenever I need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably like some purple type of packs to
any land race just because like they're
[SPEAKER_02]: not that strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love strong weed, but if I was stuck
with something forever, I would have to go
with something that's a little bit
mellower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like for my own Sandy, because a lot
of the stuff that I breed, I can't smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: it every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like when I want an experience or
like when I'm, when I'm in the right
[SPEAKER_02]: mindset, I can smoke them days and days in
a row.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then other times it's like give me
something mellow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this shit's too strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: The land races are pretty wild sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of thinking in my mind,
the packie, because if those reasons you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned, plus you can even find some
like narrow leaf packies as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it goes both ways sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the biggest mistake you see people
making when they're starting to breed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not using enough selection because I see
so many people that they pop two seeds out
[SPEAKER_02]: of like one pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say like they're growing a few
different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: But each one, they only popped like one or
two seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like something gives them a male
and they're just like, that's my male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while that can work, that's just a
crap shoot.
Like if you're lucky, that will work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nine out of 10 times, if you select a
male out of like even 10 males instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: one male, you can look for something that
you're looking for rather than just using
[SPEAKER_02]: what you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same goes for females too,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I really love hunting males and I
could get into that little what I like to
[SPEAKER_02]: look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, I want to say that people,
I don't know, I see a lot of beginner
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders, like they pop one or a few seeds
and they got like one stable female and
[SPEAKER_02]: they just like go and breed with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not like the worst idea because
like you could for sure make something
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're just doing it for yourself
and your friends at school.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's so much more potential and
more fun, really, if you can do with
[SPEAKER_02]: larger gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people always say like they don't have
the space and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just grow smaller plants and grow more
of them and look for like something
[SPEAKER_02]: special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think you have to know this plant a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can start breeding when you start
growing for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to keep an eye on the plant
as a species and see what variations are
in there and what you like and what you
don't like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how you're going to create
something a little bit better,
[SPEAKER_02]: is by weeding out the bad ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like a lot of people will say like,
yeah, I have this one plant and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty, it's not strong, but it has all
these other traits and the flavor sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll cross over this and try to
make it better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, dude, if you have bigger
selection, you'd probably find a stronger
one to work with to begin with that has
maybe a better flavor.
And then like work with a good plant and
another good plant and make those better.
Don't work with a shitty plant and a
decent plant and try to make it cool
[SPEAKER_02]: because you certainly can, but it's just
more work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like at this point, there's so much
good stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just pick a good one, like find a
good one, take the time to find special
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and then it'll create some really
cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, you just kind of said
yourself, you'd love to talk about some
[SPEAKER_01]: male selection stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we do it before we wrap it up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So male selection, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically I try to look at the male
plants as if they were female plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: look for kind of the same things you would
look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing is that you can't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people say you can try to smoke
it, but there's no buzz to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's plain and simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to go smoking your males
really to get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my first piece of advice is like
general grow, hunt males of a strain that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've already grown before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And smoke the females, or at least if you
haven't run it, you've smoked a female of
[SPEAKER_02]: it and you know what it's like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pay attention to like the,
the female of the female in that strain
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're looking for, especially if
it's like a poly hybrid that may have a
[SPEAKER_02]: few different females, you might want to
select a male that kind of seems to match
[SPEAKER_02]: up with the female that you liked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to do all of this with all
your other senses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't smoke it, but the male plant is
just as much of a cannabis plant as the
[SPEAKER_02]: female plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you first start flowering males,
like a lot of people just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of early to make your decision
because the male flowers develop over
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they'll start dropping a
little pollen, but they're not fully grown
[SPEAKER_02]: yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't seen like how it really stacks
and how it gets resonance and tricones and
[SPEAKER_02]: what it, you know, like there's a lot more
to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I recommend first of all, get like a
strain you like, start a bunch of seeds of
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even call the females if you don't
have time for that or give them away or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, but like you want a lot of males
to look through and you can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to squeeze them into two by four
or four by four or whatever, like small
[SPEAKER_02]: areas, fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small plants are fine, but like the more
plants, the better like flower in a two or
[SPEAKER_02]: three gallon if you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like to keep them small, but still get a
decent expression off of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can flower them in a soil bed if you
want, then you can do way more plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in a four by four bed, I like to
start 250 seeds and then narrow it down to
[SPEAKER_02]: like 30 to 50 final plants to hit flower
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can really look through the
phenos as they're flowering and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: clone off of them whenever you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can re-veg a male clone too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got to keep picking off the
pollen stacks, but it works usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So flower a whole bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Find, you got to stem rub them,
like I said earlier, stem rub them like
[SPEAKER_02]: probably every week or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting pretty early, you know,
when they're a few nodes tall and they
[SPEAKER_02]: start smelling pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to hunt males under full spectrum
lighting, especially a CMH, because you
[SPEAKER_02]: can really smell the turbines a lot more
with that kind of lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's the UV, maybe it's the full
spectrum, but when you got really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really stinky plants, you get a really
good clue to like what pheno that may be
[SPEAKER_02]: or like the intensity of the is big with
the male that can help a lot to pass on to
[SPEAKER_02]: the next generation and get you something
really, really terpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of growth characteristics in
veg that are pretty important when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going through big selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're starting a few hundred in
solo cups and they're ready for
[SPEAKER_02]: transplant, this is where you're going to
throw half of them out because you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to look at the root development as
you take them out of the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything that has half-assed roots,
doesn't matter how good the plant is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not perfect, get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to call it a lot of plants so that
you're just ending up with the best one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if each stage of transplant,
you have to weed out half the plants just
[SPEAKER_02]: to fit your space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's good because you're only going
to keep the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And root development is big just because
you want the best plant you can get in
[SPEAKER_02]: like every aspect and something that grows
roots fast, probably going to grow above
[SPEAKER_02]: ground faster too.
Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first males that show sex,
I always kill those no matter what.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you're just in veg and
everybody's showing female or male,
[SPEAKER_02]: like there's usually one day where like,
you know, maybe a few of the males show,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it doesn't matter, just get rid of
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually the later showing males are better
or more recessive.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these things, by the way,
you have to test in your cross because
[SPEAKER_02]: they can be totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes a male will not pass on what you
think it will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it depends on the cross, across it
with a few different things and see what
[SPEAKER_02]: happens and grow those all out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these tips will help you get like at
least one of the best males of your stock
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you might want to try a few different
ones and like a few different branches and
label everything and keep the clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then going into flower, you want to
see like, does it stack hard?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a female, does it stretch super
shitty, lanky and weak, or does it have
[SPEAKER_02]: like a little more better structure,
like more branching for the same size
[SPEAKER_02]: plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know, there's a certain
structure I like to look for, but it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, look for a good plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just take one male that you have
because you had two seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go through a lot of males, whatever you
can afford to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like just find that awesome plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like almost every male that I've ever used
has been super resinous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've heard other breeders saying that
they've never seen a resinous male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, how?
[SPEAKER_02]: I see them all the time.
Like they're out there.
They're maybe it depends what genes you're
working with because some strains may just
[SPEAKER_02]: not go in, but I think the bigger
selection, the better things you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: So go for big selection, look for female
qualities.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smell is super important.
[SPEAKER_02]: The intensity of the smell and just the
growth habits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe don't pick the very tallest male
either, but something in the middle,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bigger is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really comprehensive little
rundown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that maybe some of the reason
a lot of people don't see those resinous
[SPEAKER_01]: males is because maybe they might claim
to, but they just don't really let the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers bloom that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's something I noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of people, as you
mentioned, will be pretty quick to cull
[SPEAKER_01]: the male off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well like when I did the Blue Magoo
males and I had like 23, 22 males,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was three resinous ones that are
straight up frosty and veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I knew right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was flowering those three and a
few others and those three were like
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty taped on some areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like really frosty before pollen even came
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that might've been kind of an
exception.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those were like early, early frosty ones,
but, um, definitely some of the males that
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought were like, yeah, it's good,
but oh, well, it's not frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like then they turned out to be frosty
later in flower too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's definitely a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people might make their selections
too early just because it started dropping
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen, but you just got to keep it
somewhere separate and like bring it in
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're ready to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll jump back now to the actual last
question of our interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is, if you could go back to any one
place, any moment in time, presumably to
[SPEAKER_01]: collect seeds or maybe a clone,
where would you go and why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I like that the clone part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never thought about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, probably like, I don't
know, India always, seem to vibe with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just the imagery that I've been
exposed to, but it just seems like such a
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful place where like some beautiful
plants with amazing vibes have to come
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably like the mountains in India
and when probably, I don't know how long
[SPEAKER_02]: they've been cultivating there,
but I know they've been for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I would want to go before like
white people started bringing I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: before we like fucked everything up with
our polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anytime before, I don't know,
even the early 1900s, I'm sure like there
[SPEAKER_02]: was some great like locally bred stuff
that wasn't like super hybridized,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just like nice selections that came
from land race in the area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, like a good family
heirloom somewhere in India a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be really, really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of stuff locked away
in India that we haven't seen yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's all these people living in the
mountains that have their strains that
[SPEAKER_02]: they grow there and there's a lot of wild
strains and there's, there's like remote
[SPEAKER_02]: locations and really, really interesting
things that are hiding from civilization,
[SPEAKER_02]: which probably is for the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't ruin it like by bringing our
own seeds in there and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that one, um, that might bring
us about to the end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there any shout outs or comments you
wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, shout out to everybody that's
growing organically because it's like the
[SPEAKER_02]: single most important thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and grow for like, grow with good
vibes and good intentions, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's like, I don't know, organic and
good vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, so some people it's just going to
sound like hippie trash, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously think about it.
It's the healthiest way.
Like people are going to be smoking your
product.
Like there doesn't have to be any bottled
stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like the vibes you put in that
goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you like what you're doing,
it's really going to show and you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to create some amazing vibes and just like
do what you love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do it to impress people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it like for yourself, maybe impress
yourself, but, um, just have fun and like
[SPEAKER_02]: shout outs dangerous.
Cause I don't want to miss it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody, but, um, definitely a huge thank
you to everybody who's helped me in any
[SPEAKER_02]: way, like with growing, teaching me things
or like teaching others.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, everybody who wrote those books that
made me so paranoid, like you're the
[SPEAKER_02]: reason that I'm not in jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, like everybody does doing good things
for the canvas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's so many people working their
asses off, like in politics and shit like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, just to like try to get weed to be a
little bit more legal and safe for like a
[SPEAKER_02]: few more people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that stuff really, really goes a long
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those are the people that are
changing lives by making so like less
[SPEAKER_02]: people get in trouble for such like,
and it's a basic human right to a planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like thank you to all those warriors
out there that like doing really awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a big impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so like everybody that's ever
bred anything that I've grown because most
[SPEAKER_02]: of it is a hell of a lot easier to grow
than like gnarly ass land races for sure.
So even, you know, every, all the strains
that we're all growing, they're super
special and people definitely need to
respect even like there's, there's a few
[SPEAKER_02]: things you could say about them,
but they're, they're a lot of work that
[SPEAKER_02]: goes into everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's thank you to like everybody in
the community that's doing anything good
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's pretty much all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many good things going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, a big thank you for coming on
the show and for sharing all your wisdom
[SPEAKER_01]: with us, Mass Medical Strains.
