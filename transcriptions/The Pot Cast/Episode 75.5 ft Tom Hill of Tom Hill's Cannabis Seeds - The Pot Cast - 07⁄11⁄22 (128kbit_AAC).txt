[SPEAKER_00]: tar could so much more Thanks for coming
back to check out the second part So
[SPEAKER_00]: without further delay Let's get into it So
let's go back a bit you are you moved to
[SPEAKER_00]: the neighborhood and you started getting
exposed to a lot of the strains We've
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about What was the progress like
before you started to do your own open
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinations or did it happen immediately?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no it didn't happen immediately,
you know we were reading like Rob Clark,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know marijuana botany is it was was
the one you know that we were reading back
[SPEAKER_02]: then and it's a great great great book,
you know timeless a real gem But and and
[SPEAKER_02]: he would give you hints You know about not
backing yourself into any corners with
[SPEAKER_02]: your with your selection you and and he
would give examples of heterosis and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: about you know, how You know f1 was great
for this grower But in the next year
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a few less and then he eventually
drove this, you know lying into the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: and he would give you examples of that in
that book and You know and and and and
[SPEAKER_02]: speak of how this guy inadvertently,
you know bred himself back backed himself
[SPEAKER_02]: into a corner and back and you know,
so You could you could if you could if you
[SPEAKER_02]: could hear that message You know that he
was trying to tell you back then You know
[SPEAKER_02]: for for me first came male pollen that
makes us was the big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay I'm not gonna not even gonna try to
select a male here because I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to lose something that's
special and At the time something you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't even really test for because you
know, you're talking about smoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I know which one of these fucking
Which one of these males is smokes best,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and I mean, I'm not actually
gonna smoke and that's what Rob suggested
[SPEAKER_02]: just said, you know dry out a bag and see
which one disappears first You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is what I do with my females,
but I'm not gonna do that with my males
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just gonna make a fucking male pollen
mix and not back myself into any corners
[SPEAKER_02]: and then eventually, you know a couple You
know after thinking about it more you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll end up at open pollination before
too long for that reason It's a way to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure that you when you have something
you like it that you know that you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck it up Just let all the pollen all the
girls fly and then after that you can fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: around all you want with more intensive
breeding Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean you've spoken fondly about Rob
Clark.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a phenomenal source of information
and a pioneer I was interested were there
[SPEAKER_00]: any other sort of gurus breeders or other
sources of knowledge you hold in high
[SPEAKER_02]: esteem Yeah, you know gosh any of them
that they're Any of them they can go out
[SPEAKER_02]: on a limb and and voice something new when
they might be wrong, you know Guys like
[SPEAKER_02]: hive and and DJ short, you know,
he's got some bizarre theories DJ short
[SPEAKER_02]: does and you know and I admire them for
putting them out there and uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know It's possible that people are
gonna laugh at you You know, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: there's nothing I don't respect anything
higher than that people that are willing
[SPEAKER_02]: to You know say something that might sound
bizarre to a lot of others, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just just pure observation and And being
able to bounce it off people, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you don't say shit about what you're
thinking, you know We're not gonna get
[SPEAKER_02]: very far are we?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I admire people that come forward
with you know bizarre new theories and
[SPEAKER_00]: such Yeah, a lot of those people you just
mentioned Equally people I hold in high
[SPEAKER_00]: esteem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested now though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you got any?
[SPEAKER_00]: What you would describe as bizarre
observations of your own?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, I mean who doesn't I still suspect
these damn runs are where it's at,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's very Chi or somebody back
then said it might have been spectrum
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder Steve or somebody but uh,
hey those might be the ones you want um,
[SPEAKER_02]: just because you know so many times this
this best plan is is is you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just lacking and And and growth,
you know what you want to see in the
[SPEAKER_02]: growth of a plant It turns out to be the
best plan fucking these low-yielding thing
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know I kind of Sometimes you'll
see these ones, you know, and they just
[SPEAKER_02]: for a minute Or for brief seconds,
you know, they can't veg right,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but then they'll grow out of it
And you know and do fine, but it's almost
[SPEAKER_02]: like a regular environment is it freaks
them out, you know These ones these funds
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always I always like to keep an eye
on They often they often are exceptional
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the ones that one that You
mentioned that IC mag cannabis cup or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever 420 cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a plant like that, too It just
happened so many times that I always keep
[SPEAKER_02]: an eye on these ones that are kind of This
one's you know, kind of freaky doing its
[SPEAKER_02]: own thing over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: But they'll often end up they'll often
surprise you and be kick-ass, you know And
[SPEAKER_02]: it's never the plant that I always say
that your favorite plant like changes
[SPEAKER_02]: three or four times During the course of a
season, you know You know during growth
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll say oh this one's fucking kicking
ass is my favorite plant as you enter
[SPEAKER_02]: budding your your favorite This one look
at what this one's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah It keeps changing and changing
change and looks smell resin resin,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know And then it changes one more time
and buddy and that that's when it hits the
[SPEAKER_02]: pipe and that's the that's the final
That's the final say You know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly have noticed that myself a few
times as well It's a bit of a random side
[SPEAKER_00]: step question, but I am curious to know
what are you growing this year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh a bunch of Popular crap or not even
popular just you know same stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: other people are you know growing in the
neighborhood a big variety of stuff I have
[SPEAKER_02]: that that gelato 33 and that I really
liked I like the high off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't lie, you know, that's a good
cerebral smoke Any other notable ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been impressed by?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a few that are coming in now
one Mendo fuel or something They haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just coming off the line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Just shit that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't even harvested yet There's a few
of them that still need to come in but
[SPEAKER_02]: none of them are super impressive from
what I can see so far I would say and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a drag But they were free While
we're talking about runs is that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the reasons why you like to grow
from seed because you See those runs pop
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas with clone, you know, you don't
I've been going where I've been growing
[SPEAKER_02]: from clone for a long time for for
production, you know But I I love I love
[SPEAKER_02]: growing from seed because you never know
what you're gonna find.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like fishing, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you don't know what you're gonna
bring it up Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, let's let's go back to when
you know You're learning the ropes and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're first starting to do the open
pollinations with these lines which Of
[SPEAKER_00]: these lines really, you know How should I
say took your heart first, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: was it the deep chunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it the x18?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one really first captivated you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was deep chunk by far was my
favorite for years and years and years You
[SPEAKER_02]: know, I Couldn't very well grow even haze
commercially and I just wasn't even an
[SPEAKER_02]: option All through those years,
but deep deep chunk did exactly what I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted it to do, you know produce well in
low light conditions and And it was really
[SPEAKER_02]: good smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it cerebral smoke had very uniform
pounds You know that that plant breeds
[SPEAKER_02]: true is the driven snow And so it turned
out we're very consistent product for four
[SPEAKER_00]: decades for me Yeah, and when did the idea
of crossing it to haze come into your
[SPEAKER_00]: mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably after I read Rob Clark's
marijuana botany, you know right away and
[SPEAKER_02]: You know as soon as I had that haze and
knew how good it was but that was the plan
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing So and what was it like when
you first grew those out the f1?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you surprised by what you saw or was
all pretty much what you expected?
[SPEAKER_02]: I Didn't I've never really I've never
grown the f1 commercially, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was back then The deep chunk was it was
so good and giving what I wanted for what
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing You know, I was trying to make
move weight and It was predictable and
[SPEAKER_02]: easy and I knew that crossing out to that
fucking 14 to 6 week plant You know was
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna have me into this end of November or
something here and the rains and stuff So
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't I wasn't looking to cross it out
It wasn't looking to cross them together
[SPEAKER_02]: so much for production as I was for my own
head Yeah, okay sure that's completely
[SPEAKER_00]: understandable and I mean you've got some
other notable efforts F1 hybrids like
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the cripple Creek where you
cross the pine tar to the deep chunk I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that you know, that was one that
seems to get a few mentions online Did you
[SPEAKER_00]: did you like what you were able to see
from those F1 hybrids?
[SPEAKER_00]: And would you consider doing other F1
hybrids with your lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was just going for that,
you know for that recombination generation
[SPEAKER_02]: thing that we were talking about before I
was I was trying to You know create
[SPEAKER_02]: something Not not seen in either line by
getting into that I was just rifling
[SPEAKER_02]: through those generations And that was
just remnant seed that I had sent in But
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd never really continued on with it much
much after that I haven't done a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: F2 searches through that through them I
still have F2 seed that I made which was
[SPEAKER_02]: the point and and most of those F1s were
just remnant seed that I passed out along
[SPEAKER_02]: the way so what I wanted to put away Yeah,
okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you're stocking up So do you have
any plans to get into those or you just
[SPEAKER_00]: the other stuff is more interesting right
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well right now I think you know Haze is on
the list and the end and deep chunk
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's been I think her last
reproduction Was oh nine or something on
[SPEAKER_02]: both of those And you know, it's time to
do a germ test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably flirting with It's you know
something below 60% on what I have here So
[SPEAKER_02]: that's kind of my next my next plan is to
do those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm open pollination time again But I'll
probably make a point of saving clones
[SPEAKER_02]: from the from the Haze a portion of that
and try to find a good one Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you feel like open pollination?
[SPEAKER_00]: Captures everything in the sense that have
you noticed any variation over time in any
[SPEAKER_00]: of the lines you've done?
[SPEAKER_00]: With open pollination, or do you feel like
it does really just capture the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everything everything goes downhill
You know At a fast pace or a slow pace and
[SPEAKER_02]: open pollination is a way to make that
slow And and you know something's not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to stay killer forever if you keep
breeding with it, you know breeding is
[SPEAKER_02]: both You know what how we have such great
cannabis and it's also why we have such
[SPEAKER_02]: bad Cannabis or you know or lines that
have just been driven into the ground,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know That's a lot of I think probably
what's happened everywhere in Thailand and
[SPEAKER_02]: India You know all these places you're
like, where was this great?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's this great shit from the old days,
man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know The great spots only stay
good for this moment in time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a moving target man Yeah,
some wise words there and while we're on
[SPEAKER_00]: the topic of it Thailand recently
legalized cannabis any thoughts on that
[SPEAKER_02]: ever wanted to go there set up shop over
there No, I would say no I like I like
[SPEAKER_02]: Southeast Asia, but You know the language
barrier there is something that will never
[SPEAKER_02]: be gotten over with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, you know So it's it's the other
for me, you know For sure it represents
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too mysterious for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not that venturous Yeah, I feel you I
feel you it's not too far from me and yet
[SPEAKER_00]: it also still seems like a Big jump,
but just to loop back, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously, you're known for doing open
pollination but you've done some f1
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids and a focal discussion point of
the show is Around selecting males and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was curious to know do you have any
thoughts on selecting males?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's just a fraught adventure
given your preference for open pollination
[SPEAKER_00]: and if not Do you think there are any
traits that are associated with a better
[SPEAKER_00]: male?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I guess that's one of the common
things we discuss like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you select a male?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on the subject?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well resin, you know If you have a
resinous male That's that's worth
[SPEAKER_02]: something more than a non-resinous male,
I think I Used to I used to go and feel
[SPEAKER_02]: the stems of hay Plants if I was going to
try to do a you know, a half sieve cross
[SPEAKER_02]: or something I would you know,
if I was gonna try to get a group of males
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of a big population and do some more
intensive breeding I used to whittle them
[SPEAKER_02]: down by whether or not their their stalks
were sticky and veg because a good portion
[SPEAKER_02]: of them are and And you can smell them and
and know that that's oh, here's this
[SPEAKER_02]: here's this, you know kind of a tie
Profile that I'm after Yeah, okay
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting and I mean I'm curious what
sort of terpene profiles do you gravitate
[SPEAKER_00]: towards in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh Rotten meat That's it this one that's
I shit you not there's one You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was worried that you were gonna ask me
how do you know how this one tastes like
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: My neighbor brought over and that's like
what I that was my first impression This
[SPEAKER_02]: thing fucking takes like rotten meat man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not rotten fruit, but rotten meat like
this It's a pretty foul, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: unpleasant odor if it wasn't cannabis So I
you know, I like that one and there was
[SPEAKER_02]: there's been a lot of like Jamaicans and
stuff like that that kind of had this
[SPEAKER_02]: weird off smell that off flavor and stuff
that were really bizarre But that's one
[SPEAKER_02]: that I like I'm not kidding, you know,
like kind of a rotten fruit rotten meat,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know that that area in there Citrusy
stuff I like to tie the tie You know tends
[SPEAKER_02]: to tends to wane as it stores,
you know, you know the like when I when I
[SPEAKER_02]: grew that that chocolate tie that we had
grown out on my friend's rooftop there and
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was like Oh this this doesn't smell
at all like the brown tie bud that we had
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked, you know of the parent It's
entirely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of citrusy and and you know told
Different thing if you and then if you
[SPEAKER_02]: store it and all that stuff kind of
oxidizes and stuff feels you'll get some
[SPEAKER_02]: really more complex flavors and such out
of it, but you know, and I suspect with
[SPEAKER_02]: haze too, I would say but you know when I
find a good haze and Unfortunately don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have it or any around when you know,
I'm still smoking that shit gone Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's still green because you just you
don't reach for anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Mean in more recent times.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of discussion around
the usage and the benefits associated with
[SPEAKER_00]: an actual curing phase and I guess most
notably one of the big companies in
[SPEAKER_00]: California and now in other states like
Florida and a few others the jungle boys
[SPEAKER_00]: They their owner Ivan he famously came out
and said they don't cure their weed at all
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's best as soon as it's
harvest like as soon as it's dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: smokeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it's best Would you say that
you think that's incorrect or do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's strain-dependent?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on a cure?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Everything's gonna be different,
you know several, you know modern plants
[SPEAKER_02]: will probably be best when they're
relatively fresh and You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a bunch of them that might get
better with age, you know, I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be Different from individual to
individual for sure Yeah, interesting and
[SPEAKER_00]: with haze are there any notable changes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That take place with the cure like
obviously the color changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does the effects change over time?
[SPEAKER_02]: I Wouldn't know I smoked that shit when
it's fresh until it's gone gone gone But
[SPEAKER_02]: recently I have seen people that you know,
I've grown some of it out and And we're
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of man about this one and you
know kind of put it in the closet You know
[SPEAKER_02]: when it was fresh and then they'll break
it out months later and and remember this
[SPEAKER_02]: plant being kind Of meh and just to have
it and be incredible months and months
[SPEAKER_02]: later after it sits around and oxidizes
some and Reveals something that was you
[SPEAKER_02]: know there all the time lurking underneath
once the main, you know profile kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: dissipates what's lying underneath and
Subtle at that first often is like really
[SPEAKER_02]: really unique and beautiful and that's
what Thai was for me and and the brown
[SPEAKER_02]: Hawaiian and stuff and Jamaican,
you know, none of these Stuff that that we
[SPEAKER_02]: were getting an imports back then was
fresh, you know, it all it all had months
[SPEAKER_02]: And and shit gets really interesting when
it has that but you know If you only have
[SPEAKER_02]: a pound of it or something you're and it's
the best thing, you know by far You're
[SPEAKER_02]: just gonna go through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah, we kind of get to that
stage to realize it Yeah, definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely Decided Let me give you a
hypothetical right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just been hired to Consult for a
Thai company and they say look we've got
[SPEAKER_00]: like this facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can do indoor We can do whatever you
tell us what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think we should do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that they should grow
land-raised stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you gonna tell them modern?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you help them?
[SPEAKER_02]: In Thailand, yeah, I really liked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it what they're doing there,
you know good For them it's pretty ballsy
[SPEAKER_02]: in that area of the world, you know I
would go on a gene pool search there
[SPEAKER_02]: locally, you know I would go on a
germplasm hunt there locally and try to
[SPEAKER_02]: turn up something that was that was you
know worth it worth the name of How good
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff can really be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why I have my doubts that The stuff that
they're working with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's probably some lauation some loud
stuff or something that's kind of mediocre
[SPEAKER_02]: As time became in the end there,
but I want to believe that the old seed is
[SPEAKER_02]: still there and I would go on a hunt for
it, you know, I Hire a bunch of hookers
[SPEAKER_02]: and and took took drivers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up there somebody and uncle bills for
the attic You know the old seed has to be
[SPEAKER_02]: around somewhere I wouldn't even pass go
until I found something worth talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about and I kind of suspect they Didn't
wait for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it would be really cool To see like
some terroir land race tie stuff coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think there's probably gonna
Realistically end up being a mix of both
[SPEAKER_00]: right because you know USA hybrids are
popular worldwide no doubt about that But
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really interesting to to hear that
that you would be keen to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool Just to take us back to
the the breeding sort of questions for a
[SPEAKER_00]: moment I wanted to ask you a lot of people
talk about selecting a male around this
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of Paradigm of hemp trait versus drug
trait and like, you know just to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a common example They'll say the really
fast flowering male that wants to put out
[SPEAKER_00]: ball sacks first That's like a hemp trait
associated male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's probably not your best male
Whereas we've heard earlier that like
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not gonna call that male you keep
it around because it's got something to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer Which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious to know do you buy into the
hemp trait drug trait paradigm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think like they're all drug
trait really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think that that those traits are
inherited separately and and that's why I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't call them but Yeah, you know,
yeah, that's a correlation that I've that
[SPEAKER_02]: I that I don't believe you know,
I've had early plants That were in but
[SPEAKER_02]: they were very high in potency So I
Wouldn't I wouldn't make that association
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't bet on it How I guess would be
my answer to that man, I'm not buying it
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp trait You know, no, I believe those
those characters to be inherited
[SPEAKER_02]: separately Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what sort of males do you like
besides resinous one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any sort of profile you like or
it's just independent and each strain is
[SPEAKER_02]: its own thing Yeah, I don't I don't try to
even judge them too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just go for numbers When it comes to
males I have for you know decades to I've
[SPEAKER_02]: always been a big fan of the male pollen
mix And as you know resin, you know for
[SPEAKER_02]: you know resin for something to me,
you know But other than that, I really I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't think of anything else that I would
even Dare to try to place importance on
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean while we're talking about
importance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a sort of like a hierarchy of
Traits you like to breed for and I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: notably someone like DJ short has sort of
always commonly said Everything is
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary to the effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's sort of saying like I don't care
what it looks like if the effect is good
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like oh, you know,
you got you got a sort of like balance
[SPEAKER_00]: different aspects It's got a yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, blah blah blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you fall on that one with your
trait hierarchy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know It's it's like I said
before your favorites gonna change several
[SPEAKER_02]: times, you know throughout that cycle And
then once more at the end when you smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: it when it's in the pipe your favorite
changes again every time And that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: most important thing But you should be you
should be growing and breeding your
[SPEAKER_02]: favorites I'd like to see a plant that
grows well and stuff like that But but
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll trade all that for something that's
better smoke and and that's why you know
[SPEAKER_02]: That's I think the only thing you can
really say is your favorite, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I agree with DJ on that You know,
I'll judge other plants Certainly like
[SPEAKER_02]: when I'm when I'm shit canning or culling
clone material from growing in depths or
[SPEAKER_02]: something You know, like I despise a plant
that can't hold itself up You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a bunch of other criteria that I'm
very picky about and such But when it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to breeding seed, you know You know
if you're if you're just talking about the
[SPEAKER_02]: average guy, I mean I hope that they're
breeding for them The best smoke I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: give a shit about anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody else should either
Yeah, I agree and I wanted to touch on the
[SPEAKER_00]: x18 specifically because I think out of
your strains It's known for having a very
[SPEAKER_00]: unique flavor profile as well as being
like a fairly quality Pakistani all-round.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always interested You know,
the apple phenotype is sort of referenced
[SPEAKER_00]: here and there and it it's like an
interesting flavor because it's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: apparent in many modern strains The apple
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's x18 like to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you describe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are your what are you fond of
about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just it's a it's one of the ones that
still you know, that's still survive of
[SPEAKER_02]: what it was like, you know in the old days
That's that plant's been grown here in
[SPEAKER_02]: this neighborhood where I'm sitting right
now for you know since the early or mid
[SPEAKER_02]: 80s or something I guess it's It's a very
old and and divergent and not related To
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that's you know, that's going
around in the modern gene pool for the
[SPEAKER_02]: most part, you know So it's unique in that
way it's different, you know, it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not gonna rip your fucking head off
like You know, like some of the OGs would
[SPEAKER_02]: or something but it's certainly unique and
And that's where something you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know to a lot of people source
something in me because you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what So you get that, you know
transgressive segregation as you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need plants that are divergent from
each other It's not gonna happen when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're breeding brother to sister or
something Yeah, definitely and I mean to
[SPEAKER_00]: me one of the things I like about your
offerings is that there's sort of a few
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistanis in the mix with the pine tar
Kush or so I always got the impression
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistanis sort of didn't get enough
credit because they've got that real
[SPEAKER_00]: cerebral aspect to the indica high which
Really underrated in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been like a big fan of the
Pakistanis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do you favor them or where do you
sit on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and I you know for the exact same
reason I think that you know a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: Pakistanis have probably likely been
outcrossed it to some really cerebral
[SPEAKER_02]: Indian at some point in the distant past,
you know and I also do find them more
[SPEAKER_02]: cerebral and a lot of the certainly than
most Of the Afghans that I've come across
[SPEAKER_02]: are more of a sleepy, you know dreary less
sergeant high whereas the Paki's or the
[SPEAKER_02]: Pakistanis are You know much more cerebral
and up which I've always like I always
[SPEAKER_02]: like I'm not what I'm looking for and
pretty much everything that I smoke Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's interesting that like for the longest
time I thought you must have been like a
[SPEAKER_00]: real indica head because like on paper It
seems like there's these indica offerings,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like it's more than The cerebral stuff
you like it's sort of ironic Though those
[SPEAKER_02]: are the ones that I kept anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah Like there's a lot of you know
people, you know like like this,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know purple oracle and some of some of
these old broadleaf from up here and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: but for me they just make me sleepy and
And yeah, it's not it's not where I'm at
[SPEAKER_00]: What is what's your thoughts on the Urkel?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really big rise in popularity
over the past Years, have you grown it and
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you think the genetics are?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh We used to grow it we used to grow it
Quite a bit, you know some I don't know 20
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago or something that's a pretty old
one that's been around forever and I
[SPEAKER_02]: thought I thought I remember it coming off
a Salmon Creek or somewhere up in there up
[SPEAKER_02]: in Humboldt But I'm not sure I think it
was introduced to me as like a Salmon
[SPEAKER_02]: Creek Spurgeon Or the monkey balls or
something, you know, the old, you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: dc Like it was there broadleaf up there
real flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a nice great flavor Um,
it breeds really well But it's you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's relatively homozygous and crosses
out well um to a lot of stuff And uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: but but yeah, it makes me sleepy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked that stuff and it's just kind of
you know, it's not not very potent and It
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of makes me sleepy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't float my boat Um, you know,
so I stopped growing it yeah, okay
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting interesting and We had a lot
of listeners chime in that were hoping to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear about and I noticed this myself The
DNA for a while was offering the x18.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the backstory behind that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was on one of the Forums or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they just got up with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I sent him a bunch of pollen and
Some seeds or something though And they
[SPEAKER_02]: did some crosses and might may have done
some reproduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I don't really know but I do
remember It was like the only people that
[SPEAKER_02]: I ever sent any pollen out to You know
because they were into it and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, I just happen to have a you
know Big bindle of pollen right here of
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you know I was because I was you know
doing some breeding with it myself at the
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it did some crosses originally Um
and and you know, and I probably sent him
[SPEAKER_02]: seed as well Um, so I didn't really follow
it, but I know that did happen Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess like you're sort of confirming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's authentic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just like random seed they found
Yeah, I would I would hope not I don't see
[SPEAKER_02]: why it would be I did have you know,
I did send them a package at one point way
[SPEAKER_00]: back when Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so What will your advice be for a
new breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's looking to get into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people talk these days about How
it's also a poly hybrid that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like we're not getting anywhere with it
How can someone like get their toes wet
[SPEAKER_00]: while also actually progressing towards
something from your point of view?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean slammer, you know develop a
library of your favorite things and keep
[SPEAKER_02]: them separate and you know and and try to
Cross together things that are the most
[SPEAKER_02]: far apart from each other the most
divergent, you know and try to get into
[SPEAKER_02]: these recombination generations and find
something unique and extreme You know is
[SPEAKER_02]: is basically where all breeding starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um That's ground zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would do and and make it be
something that you like Forget about what
[SPEAKER_02]: you think people are going to like just
focus on what you actually honestly like
[SPEAKER_02]: and And you know that way you're more
likely to not not lose it And um,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's that's what's really worth
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think and trust your own taste and and
Just you know do your own thing and if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's you know, if other people agree with
that then You know, you'll you'll you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be a winner Yeah, beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder what do you think would be a good
place to start genetics wise out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Southeast Asia?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think just go for tie?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that You know, there's there's
a lot of places around there I would just
[SPEAKER_02]: scour that whole that whole area
including, you know places like reunion
[SPEAKER_02]: island and stuff and and you know Hawaii
is probably totally different today.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're probably growing white runs and
stuff out there now but um But there's
[SPEAKER_02]: probably some pockets, you know over over
there and and that in that region that
[SPEAKER_02]: still have some really good stuff,
you know Vietnam even places like this
[SPEAKER_02]: that it probably all came, you know from
Bitchin tie, but uh You know it held on a
[SPEAKER_02]: little better while the tide got bred into
the ground That would that would be a rich
[SPEAKER_02]: hunting ground for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might you know, I don't know what things
are like in Jamaica anymore Columbia maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: you know some of the some of the more
southern parts of Mexico on the Caribbean
[SPEAKER_02]: side There might be some good stuff down
in there But I don't know, you know That's
[SPEAKER_02]: my I do know I smoked some kick-ass
Colombian in Costa Rica You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: not you know, not too many decades ago
Late 90s around around, you know around
[SPEAKER_02]: 2000 or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked some really nice Colombian That
this guy had in Costa Rica that was
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely cerebral and very auditory and
and Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I still have hope that
there's good shit in all these places and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, hopefully they turn up from time
to time You gotta trust that the cream is
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna rise To the top and if they're good,
they'll probably stick around But people
[SPEAKER_02]: do appreciate them these days more it
seems like Yeah, I think Colombians are
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly on the rise at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been a focal discussion point I
would love to see more in circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any Colombian seed stock?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't Just I'm just a haze is the
only narrowly tropical that I have ever
[SPEAKER_02]: done I'm growing there's some stuff in
neighborhood like I said that Hawaii and
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know, you probably try that stuff
out, but I've smoked some from the guy and
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever like try to search out certain
seed stock or you more sort of wait for it
[SPEAKER_02]: to come to you Yeah, no, I have what I
have and that's probably all I'm ever
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna you know bother to reproduce my
enjoy, you know, I enjoy club Whatever the
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbors are growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always exciting to smoke But I don't
think I'm I would I don't think I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding new stuff is not really in the
cards occasionally a plant comes along
[SPEAKER_02]: that you know that I really like and and
The market stops agreeing with me and I
[SPEAKER_02]: know that I'll probably not be growing it
You know for very much longer and I'll do
[SPEAKER_02]: like a quick back crossing, you know Say
on it and put some seed away a bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like I did that with the Mendo
docs OG cut that I really like because it
[SPEAKER_02]: grows so well in a depth but the market
got burned out on it and Everybody shit
[SPEAKER_02]: can it and I was like, well, but wait,
but wait, this is a good plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget about your taste You know about
wanting something new forget you're burned
[SPEAKER_02]: out on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a good plan guys And then so I'll
do a quick, you know, you know either self
[SPEAKER_02]: it or do a quick back cross program and
make sure to you know, try to save stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that I like that I think that the markets
just sick up and and and We'll probably
[SPEAKER_02]: come around back around to at a later
date.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What plants have you self that of
curiosity?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's a reflection of what you
think's good Yeah, as well I felt that
[SPEAKER_02]: when we just mentioned the docs and that
was a couple of years ago I'm still
[SPEAKER_02]: growing it by clone, but the market has
certainly turned sour on it I'm reached
[SPEAKER_02]: out to down everybody's throat for
probably a decade here It's probably you
[SPEAKER_02]: know one of the most popular ones that
that people were growing into Hoops for
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long long time market was so
saturated that the buyer said nah,
[SPEAKER_02]: no more of that You know, so people stop
growing it but but I still am fuck them I
[SPEAKER_02]: still grow it just because I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the way the plant grows and
produces and It's got a it's got a good
[SPEAKER_02]: high, you know, it ticks off a lot of
boxes You know, no, it's not the original
[SPEAKER_02]: this or that but here's a plant that does
what it does really well You know comes in
[SPEAKER_02]: early All that shit, you know,
it's a growers dream Interesting and when
[SPEAKER_00]: you when you back cross something do you
have any?
[SPEAKER_00]: Particular thoughts on what sort of pollen
donor you use like for example some people
[SPEAKER_00]: say use a pollen donor That's very
different to the planet crossing to just
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's easy to phenotypically Like
call those plants out in the f1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I Would use something that yeah that you
also like And I wouldn't have any I
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't have any criteria after that It
depends what you're doing if you're like
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to isolate some trait and and you
know That would what you just said would
[SPEAKER_02]: be you would do in a back crossing scheme
You know something that would be easily
[SPEAKER_02]: easily to know that you know, it's not
coming from this parent It's coming from
[SPEAKER_02]: this parent, you know the two plants if
the donor parent is is very divergent from
[SPEAKER_02]: the recurrent parent then you're gonna
easily you know separate traits from each
[SPEAKER_02]: parent's but that but that's never like my
I Use the back crossing just as a dirty
[SPEAKER_02]: quick way to keep this this pool of
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Love that a dirty quick way of keeping
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good But some people like,
you know get a bit sort of how can I say
[SPEAKER_00]: it they take issue with s ones and they
would say our bx ones Way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any issues with s ones or you
think like no, they're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do what I need it to do Yeah,
yeah, I have no problem with with helping
[SPEAKER_02]: plants It depends what you want,
you know, but it's there's no inherent You
[SPEAKER_02]: know bad thing about it or problem with it
or argument against it if you were trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to you know Capture something as quickly
and it's dirty dirty as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would self it You know, you know boom
over one generation now I can store the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and readdress it at some later date,
you know Well, you know why why why take
[SPEAKER_02]: would you say first generation back cross
it versus BC ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: You say that takes work one, two,
three, you know, it takes a few
[SPEAKER_02]: generations There's no extra points for
taking longer to get to the same place
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've thought that I mean you're sort of
hovering around the idea of like some
[SPEAKER_00]: people would use that same analogy to say
We should be using like labs to help us
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze things Do you feel like there's
any need to use like high-tech lab stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on labs?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is gonna be a tough one in a perfect
world like you know, I mean if I have my
[SPEAKER_02]: own I might use it a little bit but I
Wouldn't rely on I would proceed with
[SPEAKER_02]: caution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you know, I most labs You know
guy have some we send it to three labs and
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever one tells her me as the highest
THC This is his favorite lab that he goes
[SPEAKER_02]: to from now on labs know this and they
inflate numbers these are some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: shifty as motherfuckers in the whole in
the whole industry right now and I
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't I wouldn't rely on the
information too much and I the other you
[SPEAKER_02]: know You know because because it's you
know, it's kind of a scam You know and the
[SPEAKER_02]: labs know this they want to make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna kick out these high numbers
for you You know, so they have a giant
[SPEAKER_02]: customer base.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't kid yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: These these guys are can be shifty too so
I don't trust it for that reason and And
[SPEAKER_02]: and more, you know shit, you know,
we could be wrong about you know about
[SPEAKER_02]: this being such an important deal You know
high THC or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could be entirely wrong about that
There could be giant pieces of the puzzle
[SPEAKER_02]: that are still missing and I you know,
I still think that the first bag that
[SPEAKER_02]: disappears out of the group of your
samples That's the best weed and I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: care what a lab says especially if there's
room for human error and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's like Asking somebody else,
you know what you should smoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I mean, I think that's a judgment
that you should make in the old-fashioned
[SPEAKER_02]: way and be very leery about Having these
numbers drive your drive your selection So
[SPEAKER_00]: we're this is like a really interesting
discussion point because a lot of guests
[SPEAKER_00]: end up discussing this and how the market
is being led too much by numbers and I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess When I think about it The issue that
I see is that a lot of the really hardcore
[SPEAKER_00]: smokers and growers are very aware of this
But it's it's largely speaking the 80% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the casual consumer base so to speak that
are driving a lot of the Decisions and
[SPEAKER_00]: purchases through what is seemingly just
looking at the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the question becomes how do we
educate like the casual smokers out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that you do need to use your head because
for a lot of them it's sort of Like they
[SPEAKER_00]: just want an easy metric to fall back on
and the THC percentage seems to be that is
[SPEAKER_00]: it is it Education or do you think like
maybe the growers just need to force it on
[SPEAKER_00]: them by just saying not really growing
this like haze You do have to put up or
[SPEAKER_02]: shut up, you know Kind of saying I mean if
the cream will rise to the top if you have
[SPEAKER_02]: something that only tests at 17% or
something and and it just and it fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: rips your head off and there's no denying
it that will eventually cut through all
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know and become popular and people
people smoke it and want it and covet it
[SPEAKER_02]: and It'll rise to the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think and all this high THC stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of oh man You know most of the
time I tried these new things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to be all this and all that and
have this Sticker with this big high
[SPEAKER_02]: number on it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like meh, you know, not not not too
much of it is what I would call You know
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly potent or cerebral Yeah,
okay interesting interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is very much like a sentiment that
there's like a same sameness About a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the modern stuff some of the notable
older heads are like notably Not a fan of
[SPEAKER_00]: like cookies and the the derivatives of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you are you a bit like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like cookies is like the
poster child for us backing ourselves into
[SPEAKER_00]: the corner?
[SPEAKER_00]: So to speak or do you like it and some of
the offspring of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I Think it I think it's too popular,
you know, and it's driving too many
[SPEAKER_02]: people's decisions in their selections
because They want to get a piece of this
[SPEAKER_02]: popularity and stuff but that but that's
grabbing this huge giant market share of
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeders time and stuff and they should be
doing something else man.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, you know,
I've enjoyed some very cerebral plants out
[SPEAKER_02]: of that gene pool As well and you know,
I think it goes back to really OG And it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like TK and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things are pretty good, man Yeah
100% and the story that goes around about
[SPEAKER_00]: the TK is that it's essentially like two
Hindus crossed together Could you believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't even touch I'd rather try to
touch the moon and try to figure out the
[SPEAKER_02]: lore of fucking cannabis that everybody's
so can you know obsessed with in the
[SPEAKER_02]: history of this and that you know Because
it doesn't matter, you know, what matters
[SPEAKER_02]: is it's a really great plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It breeds, you know, it breeds really well
And why speculate on what we don't know it
[SPEAKER_02]: would be I guarantee you'd be a guess that
we don't know what it is Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: so why the fuck guess about it,
you know, that's silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it So I wanted to ask you,
you know You've grown up during what would
[SPEAKER_00]: be arguably the golden years of Northern
California being in the Mendocino area
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it been like to live there over the
years and what are some of the interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: changes you've seen unfold?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know not much has changed,
you know when you don't go anywhere kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of saying It's a beautiful place to be and
it just has a really good vibe and You can
[SPEAKER_02]: live your you can live your life,
you know and peace You know, there's when
[SPEAKER_02]: when you know medical came out and stuff
Oh, you know a bunch of new guards came up
[SPEAKER_02]: here and guys with dollar signs in their
eyes and stuff but that's you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's Fading away now, too I just really
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's peaceful.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can you can live how you
want and that's really important to me
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean I know you're fairly
self-sufficient Do you like that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: more isolated lifestyle being up there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh for sure You know people they're the
worst Plants and animals sure,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I love both of those things but
yeah, I'm kind of a hermit in that regard
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a bit of autism and and I'm
perfectly fine to be for long periods of
[SPEAKER_02]: time by myself I've done some
single-handed sailing, you know to and
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy that a lot Tell us about the sailing
that sounds cool Back in many it was 99 or
[SPEAKER_02]: 97 99 I am about a sailboat and Sailed
from California down to you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexico and Central America down to Costa
Rica and and came back a couple years
[SPEAKER_02]: later, you know took like took some time
to To do some sailing some you know to the
[SPEAKER_00]: tropics and such it was good fun Is that
when you got to try that infamous
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I tried to Colombian on a just a
previous plane plane ride trip down there
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at property The real estate guy
was the guy who actually had it but what a
[SPEAKER_02]: sales technique get you all high on
Colombia and take you for a walk through
[SPEAKER_02]: the Tropical, you know properties that he
had for sale He'd be like wow But yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a real estate guy and in the
western side of Costa Rica, but that was
[SPEAKER_02]: it was previous to when I sailed down
there but I sailed down there about ten
[SPEAKER_00]: years after or something Yeah,
okay interesting interesting and I mean if
[SPEAKER_00]: we jump back to sort of the growing up in
the emerald Triangle so to speak a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: focal discussion takes place around like
the legal changes that have occurred over
[SPEAKER_00]: the past ten years how some people have
been forced out of the industry and even
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the area in general Do you feel
like there are any changes needed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: current sort of regulations and legal
landscape or do you think It's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're it's just about the
cream rising to the top No, I think you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, that's going to happen regardless
And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't I think it would be wasted effort
to to try to change anything there There
[SPEAKER_02]: are people that are crying, you know about
big money coming in and stuff But now
[SPEAKER_02]: there's big money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crying, you know packing its bags and
heading back down to the city So I
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't I wouldn't pretend to know what
to change You know, nobody's getting
[SPEAKER_02]: busted and going to jail now for long
periods of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good You know, whatever else comes
with that is just tough shit Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's definitely the number one
metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to take into account despite how
incomes might be affected but um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you because I'm invariably
gonna get hassled if I don't if people
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to get your seeds is there a way
they can get Them are they available at
[SPEAKER_00]: all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't you know, I don't know if any
of these banks still have seed stock
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people that have done
reproductions and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm certainly not doing it anymore You
know, you know, I still pass out seeds to
[SPEAKER_02]: friends and stuff and sometimes friends
will do a reproduction too I think I think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's up there at CSI did maybe a PTK one
or something, you know, and that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got You know, and and he does a good
job and you know, I mean if I was me I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: have no problem going to him, you know,
I've seen some really good haze Stuff out
[SPEAKER_02]: there too that have been done by other
people The business is just it's not for
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather breed dogs Tell me what dogs do
you breed?
[SPEAKER_02]: British working terriers like powderdale
and Jack Russell and and Lakeys You know
[SPEAKER_02]: digging dogs work working dogs of the you
know Terriers from from Britain from UK
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you got any on your property now in
Asia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is where is is where I do it, you know
have a farm or you know place there and
[SPEAKER_02]: they have a big rat problem It's something
like I don't know up to 20% or something
[SPEAKER_02]: per year of their Rice crop is just
demolished by rats You'll see him out
[SPEAKER_02]: there with a stick of bamboo swat net rats
in the in the in the fields You know
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to kill rats like that and I just
think you know, there's got to be a better
[SPEAKER_02]: way man So I so I imported a bunch of
kick-ass little terriers from from the UK
[SPEAKER_02]: You know to Asia to try to help out those
farmers there with their with their rat
[SPEAKER_02]: problem in a more You know efficient
manner That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have like a little base you've set
up over there like where you go and spend
[SPEAKER_02]: time every so often I Have children there
and family there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone knew that Yeah,
yeah in the Philippines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two two children Fantastic and you
just alternate between California in there
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean the whole clover thing kind of
screwed us up a whole bunch did You know
[SPEAKER_02]: travel is more difficult financially to
you know now Everybody's busy working,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and and not taking off around the
world as much as they'd like including me
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long has it been since you've been
able to get back there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's been just I think two two years
now in 2021 I'm hoping to get over there
[SPEAKER_02]: this fall, but yeah It's been a good two
years now that whole country was on
[SPEAKER_02]: lockdown for God for several months and
when I came back here the last time from
[SPEAKER_02]: there, I barely got out of the country and
I was like, you know, I mean it was the
[SPEAKER_02]: only plane that left that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else was cancelled cancelled
cancelled down the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really lucky to get out And then for
a while I was scared it was still
[SPEAKER_02]: teetering on the edge and I was scared to
get can I go back and get stuck there and
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know and not Be able to be here at
work where I need to be Things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but I hope to get back this year things
They seem to everything has settled down
[SPEAKER_02]: quite a bit now As far as you know
worldwide travel goes Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious to know how do you find the
difference in climate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do you feel like you've adapted to
the heat?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, I mean it's hotter here but it
is it is human there but you know It's
[SPEAKER_02]: only like low 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas, you know here the few days ago I
mean it was a record-breaking heat day,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was a hundred and ten here the
other day And it was hot I mean your water
[SPEAKER_02]: your water water bottle jug that you had
beside you all day By the time six or
[SPEAKER_02]: seven o'clock in the evening rolled around
you'd take a swig off of it and you'd be
[SPEAKER_02]: damn It's water if it feels hot in my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how hot it was and it's never like
that there and you know where I'm at it's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of coastal and again It gets a breeze
and you know, there's a little elevation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not too bad where I'm at Okay,
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool to hear On a sort of unrelated
note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you I've always loved the
names of your lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like Deep Chunk and Pine Tar Cush
They're like they're cool names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did these names come from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pine Tar Cush was just my you know,
I always called it D15 you know or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the chemist calls it I called
them all by numbers and I know you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of felt like that wouldn't do you
know for people when I passed them outside
[SPEAKER_02]: tried to you know describe them and You
know the the first the early time I was
[SPEAKER_02]: passing out The Deep Chunk what you know,
it would be called Monkey Balls because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what you know used to be called You
know a friend of mine named it that
[SPEAKER_02]: actually it's a you know, there's a tree
that grows all over Suburbia United States
[SPEAKER_02]: that that when it seeds it drops these
like round golf balls under the sidewalks
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere and we used to skid on them
when we were on our skateboards and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, You know people would have fights
with them throwing them at each other You
[SPEAKER_02]: know all over the small towns of America
and and that nickname for this there's
[SPEAKER_02]: these round balls that cover sidewalks and
in streets and entire neighborhoods It's
[SPEAKER_02]: just a shade tree It's not good for much
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think but but the nickname for him
these these round balls are monkey balls
[SPEAKER_02]: So my friend said he got any more of those
monkey balls one day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kept the name for a long long time
Right before I put it out there in public
[SPEAKER_02]: to people from like over go and such I had
seemed like I think was like a South Park
[SPEAKER_02]: cartoon or something Where they actually
said Jesus Christ monkey balls or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I looked up monkey balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like fucking How did they get this
from and And monkey balls it was what it
[SPEAKER_02]: was a video game, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like fuck I'm gonna get sued
right by this fucking video game people I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't fucking release this shit under the
handle monkey balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm stupid Nintendo or somebody right it's
gonna come after me So I changed it to
[SPEAKER_02]: deep chunk on the fly real quick before I
put it out there to the public The x-18
[SPEAKER_02]: was one that my mother came was called
number 18 And I was just too lazy to come
[SPEAKER_02]: up with a name for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well the pine tar curse, you know,
it does have some some piney and tarry
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of things going on and it's a
broadleaf, you know, so just Just threw it
[SPEAKER_00]: out there Beautiful I love the name deep
chunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Flash of creativity if nothing
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it our our buddy Caleb inspector He
actually said at one point that after
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that pine tar cush recreation and
like having Gotten a bit of experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with the line through seeing the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says he wouldn't be surprised if it's
somehow in Urkel Do you have any thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: on this given you've seen both?
[SPEAKER_02]: I Don't know I think They're probably both
derived from you know, similar shit from
[SPEAKER_02]: the from the similar neighborhood up here
Inspectors always trying to find you know
[SPEAKER_02]: figures figure shit out that he's never
gonna know for sure You know, but I spend
[SPEAKER_02]: time on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I don't know It's certainly different
from you know, they're different,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they're the same type of plant,
you know, these are just Sir, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: broadleaf from from from this region that
you know that were around way back in the
[SPEAKER_02]: day I'm talking late 70s early 80s,
you know right from the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_02]: introductions to broadleaf and up in these
up in these You know communities up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both certainly survivors of that
but as to their relation, I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: Urkel's very different From it And so I
don't know Yeah, so I understand I
[SPEAKER_00]: understand out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever heard of Christmas tree bud
or Christmas bud?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was uh, that was Stuff that we
used to get around Christmas time back
[SPEAKER_02]: down in Southern California would come in
it would come in late at least the one
[SPEAKER_02]: that I remember we used to call it
Christmas bud and It was uh Also called
[SPEAKER_02]: something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was a three river sativa or
something come out of the like Yosemite
[SPEAKER_02]: region or not Yosemite But uh,
what's that other national park down
[SPEAKER_02]: there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sequoia In the foothills of this national
park, you know east eight northeast of la
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they there was a growing
community called three rivers And there
[SPEAKER_02]: was some late sativa that came out of
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've always been in by Christmas And
that's what me and my you know people that
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to call it Christmas, but Okay,
the reason I ask is because I'd heard some
[SPEAKER_00]: people I can't remember who I wish I could
credit them Compare the Christmas bud to
[SPEAKER_00]: PTK and I guess like someone was sort of
saying like are they the same thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're just similar sort of
Pakistanis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess really Yeah, who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I if we might be talking about a
different Holy different totally different
[SPEAKER_02]: term, you know this uh, there's three
river sativa that that we used to get down
[SPEAKER_02]: in la But certainly didn't smell like a
Christmas tree if if that's what these
[SPEAKER_02]: other That's what this other Christmas you
said Christmas tree bud and probably
[SPEAKER_02]: something probably something entirely
different but The PTK does have some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that type of some some of those type of
profiles in it for sure You know kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: Pine piney thing going on and But it's
just pretty variable still too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean it's pretty raw that one
the x-18 I think was more stable From of
[SPEAKER_02]: the chemists, you know of those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the PTK still still pretty
raw There's probably lots of good stuff in
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know Yeah, interesting and did you
ever try any of like the fabled northern
[SPEAKER_00]: lights clones that circulated the Mendoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Area in like the 90s like and did you were
you a fan of it if so?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Well, we've on this road where I'm out
Everybody had it in seed form It was you
[SPEAKER_02]: know Everybody was growing from northern
lights from seed feminized seed mind you
[SPEAKER_02]: From you know stressed out rooms and stuff
and that stuff came out really uniform And
[SPEAKER_02]: sold real well, but yeah, most people grow
grew northern lights from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of the clones You know five to all
these ones that everybody else knows of
[SPEAKER_02]: we're up here that I know of but everybody
had Northern lights and seed and seed farm
[SPEAKER_02]: up here and they and they used that
because it was all female seed But they
[SPEAKER_02]: kept on you know producing it in their
rooms You know, it would throw a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and as you're a smoker or whatever
you'd save your seeds from it and you'd
[SPEAKER_02]: end up with a pile of these northern light
seeds and you'd fucking grow them again
[SPEAKER_02]: and there'd be It would be a way to
without cloning run all-female Rooms up
[SPEAKER_02]: here that happened for years and years and
years and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know several people that grew Craig and
Lester's northern lights line.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we call it up here They've
both passed away now, so it's okay to say
[SPEAKER_02]: their name But these two brothers had Epic
northern lights line up here on the hill
[SPEAKER_02]: where I'm at and that that was like the
earliest thing that anybody was growing up
[SPEAKER_02]: here and they and they did that for years
and years and years later, you know a few
[SPEAKER_02]: people would try out some white widow or
something but Then the northern light seed
[SPEAKER_02]: from the hill here was was a staple for
like, you know the first decade of indoor
[SPEAKER_02]: growing up here Big generator grows,
you know, it's with 60 light rooms and
[SPEAKER_02]: such and what was the the bud like It was
pretty much um Looked very similar To this
[SPEAKER_02]: that one up in Canada bccc or something
I've seen photos of some pretty legit
[SPEAKER_02]: looking northern lights, but it's very
resinous But it's another one with these
[SPEAKER_02]: small resin heads man, and it was pretty
lightweight I have to say it didn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: you super high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it was serviceable smoke for sure
But it was one of these ones that were
[SPEAKER_02]: that faked you out Man looked like a sea
resin with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were empty nests man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody was home upstairs They're small
one-bedroom apartment It had small resin
[SPEAKER_02]: head man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I didn't particularly like it I still
have some of the seed here and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they don't they don't they won't
germinate for me anymore They're that old
[SPEAKER_02]: but um, but I save them anyway We might be
able to get them back that way,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know via other tissue culture or
something one day So I'd save seeds even
[SPEAKER_02]: if they don't even if they don't Won't
germinate for me anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Yeah, there's a there's a famous old
one up here up in the hills But I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: remember the the clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the thing The northern lights
didn't grow anywhere in new york's as good
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor as it performed indoor,
you know You weren't gonna like try to try
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow giant plants of it or something It
lacked bigger compared to a lot of other
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that we were growing outdoor back
then Um, it didn't produce as much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just A smaller plant, you know less
bigger Um, it was decent serviceable weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was kind of a morning smoke,
you know, it wasn't gonna floor you It's a
[SPEAKER_02]: great breeding plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know have no doubt about that
We've seen you know, a gazillion hybrids
[SPEAKER_02]: with it in it that are good You know,
that's a great, you know, nothing to say
[SPEAKER_02]: that nothing bad about is it's a it's a
famous and and an excellent plant that's
[SPEAKER_02]: that's Certainly been valuable to the gene
pool, I think um But yeah, I mean It
[SPEAKER_02]: itself as a line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, it was okay you know I more value it
for its breeding worse probably Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow you read my mind when you said,
you know, you're still sitting on it even
[SPEAKER_00]: though they won't germ I was curious to
know do you have any other notable seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: in your collection that are like special
to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though they may not germ but you
know, yeah memorable For one reason or
[SPEAKER_02]: another Yeah, well, I still have all those
uh a rid the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think the original uh ptk stuff
The stuff that went back to all that
[SPEAKER_02]: cripple creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's getting pretty old now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was like I don't know 2000 or
something might have been even been from
[SPEAKER_02]: the late 90s Or something that's probably
launched proud anymore, but but i'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: throw them away Um, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some old I have some old reunion
islands Stuff that probably won't sprout
[SPEAKER_02]: but I won't throw it away You know,
um that old northern lights line Um some
[SPEAKER_02]: old salmon creek hybrids probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have a few I know that I know I
like back and won't sprout and then um,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I but I refuse to throw them away i'm
just a you know a Seed junkie,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess they might be worth something
later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't throw it away I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it And uh, were there ever any
notable clones that went through the area
[SPEAKER_00]: that were really special to you that have
just been lost to time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, you know, I mean Some of the
great outdoor performers, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish people had kept had held on to uh,
You know the salmon creek You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh I even I missed the blue dreams
Sometimes to be honest people are gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: laugh but that was an okay plant old
faithful got your high, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I'm there with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was great Yeah, yeah,
I mean it wasn't it wasn't you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean there's a certain There was a
certain what I call muddiness to the high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't like crystal clear and stuff It
was it was kind of a little bit um,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know Fuzzy and and cloudy I would say
of a high but uh, it was certainly potent
[SPEAKER_02]: and Man, that plant's bombproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grow right through a snowstorm Hell
yeah, and I mean given you're in the area
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you ever like, you know You hear
stories about the famous brothers of
[SPEAKER_00]: eternal love and stock coming from the
early stuff they brought in Did you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: see any of that or do you think that's
sort of a bit more fabled?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't have any Opinions about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's mostly that's i'm not probably
quite that Old that's like sam skunk man
[SPEAKER_02]: old I'm not quite i'm not quite i'm
getting up there, but i'm not there yet
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I do know that there is lots of
really really good shit, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean california and you know,
um Surfers, you know, they smoke weed And
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the california has always been a great
big fan of weed Um, and there was some
[SPEAKER_02]: really good shit that that got shipped
into california port You know due to that
[SPEAKER_02]: And uh, you know, there was great mexicans
and there was and there was crappy
[SPEAKER_02]: mexicans, too Um, but that was probably
the you know, the most popular um,
[SPEAKER_02]: or the most you know Of what was there
whether you would get to the jamaicans the
[SPEAKER_02]: tai the hawaiian, you know All this stuff
came in occasionally and there was some
[SPEAKER_02]: really really great stuff Um here in
california always You know and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed us to like, you know kind of a be
be a kind of a place where You know things
[SPEAKER_00]: thrived for a long time Yeah, interesting
and I mean I don't think you've mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: it so i'll just ask and get it out of the
way Do you ever have you ever had any
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with like african strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a spot in your heart for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew a malawi up here one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um during the late 80s and it and it
fucking it was a Intersex, you know
[SPEAKER_02]: nightmare that was all Seated and just
gave me a headache And uh, and I threw it
[SPEAKER_02]: I threw it in the toilet But I probably
wish I didn't I would say, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if I probably should have you know If I if
I had known I would have probably grabbed
[SPEAKER_02]: some of those seeds and set them aside You
know, but you know the one time I had a
[SPEAKER_02]: look at some african here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't work out And I quickly called it
Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not as much success as with some of the
hazes Yeah Um there and there's some you
[SPEAKER_02]: know before before the broadleafs came up
here everybody was growing mexican You
[SPEAKER_02]: know the earlier mexicans, you know,
there was there's definitely two different
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you had your You know, you're really
trippy cerebral, you know ones that were
[SPEAKER_02]: down from further south on the on the on
the merediterranean or on the caribbean
[SPEAKER_02]: side And then you had this northern
mexican stuff that came in real early And
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like the bulk of what got shipped
north through california.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was lower Quality, but some of that
stuff came in early and you could finish
[SPEAKER_02]: it in northern california You know way
better than the ties and everything else
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so, you know early on that's what most
people were growing up here with some
[SPEAKER_02]: mexican.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um There's there were some good ones of
those around Um, and I saved one I forgot
[SPEAKER_02]: what the hell happened to that thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I don't have it now But I had it,
you know, 20 years ago or something sent
[SPEAKER_02]: it to somebody I forget who I don't
remember anyway Wow, very interesting very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting So we had some of our
listeners as well as myself were curious
[SPEAKER_00]: You sort of have had a bit of a notable
absence in the community for a few years
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you willing to share any insight about
what you've been doing in that time or why
[SPEAKER_00]: you decided to take some time away?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, I mean there's there's uh
There's there's good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um That i've met From those places from
the you're talking about the forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's some great i've met some
great friends Um, you know getting
[SPEAKER_02]: involved with all that But there's but
there's also some you know, there's some
[SPEAKER_02]: real filth That somehow for some reason
seems to get attracted to this to the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole to the whole scene, man Um,
and it kind of freaks me out a little bit,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um Uh that that not everybody
has your best interest in mind So I so I
[SPEAKER_02]: just don't you know I felt like I had to
have a presence there when I passed out A
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of genetics, you know and made
available a bunch of genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt I owed it to people You know to try
to to try to you know, say something about
[SPEAKER_02]: him help him with him or whatever but um
But I felt like those dudes, you know that
[SPEAKER_02]: that you know that i've done that and um
And other than that it's like eh It kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of gives me the willies to even to even go
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel the same way about going to europe,
you know, I mean I'm just uncomfortable in
[SPEAKER_02]: that in that in that scenario Kind of you
know, I don't like being the center of
[SPEAKER_02]: attention Although you know i'll get drunk
on some beer and just kick my foot in poor
[SPEAKER_02]: gypsy's front door and just raise hell
until you know And fly off the handle it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't bother me, you know when i'm
hammered but uh When i'm sober and and
[SPEAKER_02]: probably have something to actually add
It's just saying it doesn't even i'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: even attracted anymore, you know Um,
I wanted to ask you there's actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: notable clone that goes around like the
norcal area It's chem d across to tom
[SPEAKER_00]: hills haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever heard or seen of that one by
any chance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Never have that's that's awesome though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um That somebody's taking the time to you
know to actually set aside a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's fucking bitching I'd love
to i'd love to check it out But yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not heard that There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll have to put the feelers out
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to get it into your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be cool Uh, so I I wanted to ask you
a bit unrelated but um What do you what's
[SPEAKER_00]: your thoughts of sam?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know sam often gets scapegoated as
like a bit of a villain by some people But
[SPEAKER_00]: it sounds like you're more of the school
of thought that I am which is that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: you know Maybe done more than anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you fall on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. David watson.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's he's you know There's there's not
many that have done what he's done Uh for
[SPEAKER_02]: the for the community and and the
worldwide gene pool and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know He made available stuff that
people You know would have never even you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, I mean what were they doing in
holland when he showed up I think they
[SPEAKER_02]: were smoking some dirty hash from morocco
or somewhere mixed with tobacco So yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's I think he's a good man and
and uh and honest and all that You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I don't I don't think you know,
i'll give him hell when i'm hammered but
[SPEAKER_02]: um But but I think for the most part this
guy's this guy's great and and his friend
[SPEAKER_02]: rob, you know, I think Those guys are are
absolutely, you know excellent uh
[SPEAKER_00]: ambassadors of of cannabis Yeah here here
here I should have asked you this one a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit earlier when we were talking about,
you know sort of being in The norcal area,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wanted to hear your thoughts on the
idea of like clones degrading over time
[SPEAKER_00]: and people speculate like maybe it's like
genetic drift or like deterioration What's
[SPEAKER_00]: your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that clones degrade over
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like do you think it's possible to
stop that through like maybe keeping them
[SPEAKER_00]: like really happy their whole lives?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you fall on this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that time itself is it won't
degrade them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we're actually talking about
pathogens, um that that you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: eventually get them and uh, and and
they'll succumb to them and and they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: put out less performance and that's just a
A fact of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it doesn't last as long as
a grape clone or Something else you
[SPEAKER_02]: probably clean it up in the lab and all
that stuff's possible and such but Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't just deteriorate and fall apart
genetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh Anyway, you know, I mean I mean you
might have drift or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I I don't see it happening I think
this is we're talking about pathogens that
[SPEAKER_02]: just you know, eventually the plant
succumbs to Have you ever heard people
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about dotting Yeah, same thing same
thing You know, these are likely pathogens
[SPEAKER_02]: that have you know taken hold of the plant
and and fucked up its performance Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that um in the community the
hoplite and viroid is like largely
[SPEAKER_00]: considered the source of that But I guess
you know being secluded and growing from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably don't really encounter much
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, um, I don't uh where I'm growing from
seed and and and luckily I haven't you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, I haven't had any bad problems,
uh from clone either and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how I hear that's widespread,
but I'm probably pretty Removed from you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, what everybody else is kind of
working with I'm not going down and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know buying clothes from the dispensary or
whatever Yeah, true advantage the the
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimate quarantine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it So I think that brings us to our
quickfire questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask you first of all What
is your absolute favorite strain of all
[SPEAKER_00]: time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm Ty reed Thailand race.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so Next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the most single memorable
experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've had with cannabis be it like,
you know Because it was potent or just
[SPEAKER_00]: because of like the set and setting and it
was super memorable What's the number one
[SPEAKER_00]: most memorable?
[SPEAKER_02]: This flavor that I came across in a deep
chunk plant once I call it top rock
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's where it was grown,
but it had such a rich Kind of coffee
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor that actually would coat your
throat and make your throat actually numb
[SPEAKER_02]: How give your throat a numb feeling?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nothing like ever anything I've
ever experienced with cannabis before or
[SPEAKER_00]: after Wow, you've only seen it that one
time Yeah Gosh, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so On the other end of the spectrum
What's a strain where everyone was hyping
[SPEAKER_00]: it up and you were really excited to try
it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you finally did and you were just
disappointed Shit Can I say most
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that's bit that's around right
now, you know, I mean Every day every day
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's hyped up these days and it
never fucking comes through You know as
[SPEAKER_02]: much as you're hoping, you know,
you just you know that the majority of
[SPEAKER_02]: what's out there fits that Description I
think No, so not one sticks out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know thousands upon thousands upon
thousands a wave of them stand out to me
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know Everything is hyped up
and it never delivers Holding no punches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Let's say I'm gonna drop you off on a
mythical magical desert island You've got
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you need to grow and you're
only allowed to take three strains with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take seeds or clones what three
things Are you gonna take that are gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: do you right for the rest of time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Haze tie and deep chunk in seed form all
That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I come back in like 20 years,
you'll just have recreated everything No,
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably still be growing haze Okay,
so final question what is Your ultimate
[SPEAKER_00]: hopes in terms of the future for the
cannabis scene in what direction do you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be the best outcome in your
mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm Well for to you know finish to finish
making it not a criminal activity,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know around the world that would be
nice and for You know as far as the scene
[SPEAKER_02]: goes, I wish people would just you know be
be more Doing what they want to do what
[SPEAKER_02]: they like doing doing what they like
growing what they like breeding What they
[SPEAKER_02]: like what they like not what their markets
looking for anything else But I wish
[SPEAKER_02]: people would be more honest with you know
What their favorite is and kind of kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: take it upon themselves to be a steward of
you know of those varieties What a
[SPEAKER_00]: brilliant sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can totally endorse that one So I think
that just about brings us to the end of it
[SPEAKER_00]: for this one Do you have any comments or
shout outs you'd like to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I just I know it's hard
times for a lot of a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_02]: are still in the you know cannabis Growers
out there and stuff and hang tough,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know It's there's a you know,
everything seems dark But but there's
[SPEAKER_02]: there's sunny sides to it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our roads are a lot quieter and you know,
it's kind of peaceful outside right now
[SPEAKER_02]: and and You know, you're just one kind of
awesome clone away from changing the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stick with it Brilliant stuff.
