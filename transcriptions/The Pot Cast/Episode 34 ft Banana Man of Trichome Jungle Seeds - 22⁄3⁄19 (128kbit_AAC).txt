[SPEAKER_06]: And a special, special thank you to our
friends at Dragonfly Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: That light that leads the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: On this episode, Trichome Jungle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I said it before.
[SPEAKER_06]: You ready for it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Part two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get that hitter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we are again, my friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: Part two with a good friend of mine,
the guy who I like to chat with a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big thank you and welcome to Banana Man
from Trichome Jungle Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice to be back on the show again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, been looking forward to this.
[SPEAKER_06]: How you been, my friend?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really good, really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just been spending a lot of time
yeah, on my own a lot lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, just being with the plants and
yeah, just doing my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really enjoying the time by myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see that you were on holiday not too
long ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we did a little trip to India.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, Sonic Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few other guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: A guy from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghan Black Honey.
[SPEAKER_02]: He came out from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a big farm out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Met up with some Indian guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went up to Malana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just all round.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely amazing experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to go to the fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, select our own seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Found some really special smelling things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are a ranger from like melons and
grapefruit to like berries and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what was the standout smoke of the
trip?
[SPEAKER_02]: We were smoking a lot of charis mainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a few friends, there was some,
we got some brought some gelato with us
[SPEAKER_02]: and things like this and a few different
Moroccan hashes to show the farmers there
[SPEAKER_02]: and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, but the charis up in that like
altitude and smoking from the chillum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a total different high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, really enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everybody's sort of like you're
smoking the chillum and everybody's
[SPEAKER_02]: talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's like a really nice energy from
the, from smoking the hash as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you feel like it's, it's almost kind
of like more satire-y?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it kind of sounds like you're saying
like it's kind of social and energetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more fresher stuff seems to be like
more energetic, but anything that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: cured for a while, especially the previous
year's charis that they've cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, when I was smoking that,
I couldn't help but just fall asleep here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one day I think I had two naps after
smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, that stuff was super strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it depends on the curing
process a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even from field to field and farmer to
farmer, there was a difference in the
[SPEAKER_02]: heirloom varieties that they were
cultivating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there was definitely a
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So depending on who you got the hash from,
there would be a difference in high
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor, how it's smoked, how it burned,
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And were they all growing heirloom
varieties or did you see like some kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: random stuff in the mix?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I didn't notice any sort of modern
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like in closer to the cities and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you'd see more things like they're
speaking to other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seen some stuff like that,
but right up where we were going,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was just all stuff that they've been
farming for generations really.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smells were really unusual in some
fields, but you have this underlying
[SPEAKER_02]: standard smell that you found a lot
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you had variations from that and
then the odd unique one when you got to
[SPEAKER_02]: the fields and could really go into the
fields.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what was that standard smell kind of
like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a spice, maybe slight aniseed smell
and a slight berry smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the main ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like in the fields, you were finding,
I'd say about 20% were purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the purple ones had a slight more
berry smell, but even some of them still
[SPEAKER_02]: had that spicy underlining, spicy smell
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the most unique ones were the ones
that smell like watermelon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but watermelon sweets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was just one plant, just one plant
out of the whole field.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just really, really strange.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I found one that was straight
grapefruit, pomelo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just kept trying to look for more of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only that one plant I could find.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking like out of a field of
thousands of thousands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was just going around, but the
dominant smell was the spice smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spice berries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the best way to describe
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like raisins, raisins.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like raisins.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so were you looking to collect seeds
and were you successful?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I collected like, I've labeled them as
like what they smelled like mainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what I was trying to find.
[SPEAKER_02]: The growth and other things I wrote down,
but the main things for me were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: there was one that smelled like Vicks
vapor rub.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one that smelled like the
grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I did a selection for purple types,
purple calyx, purple leaf, ones for red
[SPEAKER_02]: stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few other ones that were like green
varieties, but with that typical sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: spiced smell that the usual ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like you could see a big difference
even in the growth of the plants as you
[SPEAKER_02]: were growing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Much, much higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when you're going from like a
thousand feet higher up, and then you took
[SPEAKER_02]: another 500 and like you were seeing a big
difference in the growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things were getting smaller as you were
getting higher up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of becoming like more squat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not squat as such, but smaller in
structure, in height and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they weren't, um, like anything like
an indica, even though they're a hash
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but then once I've seen the seeds
being grown out back here, they look more
[SPEAKER_02]: indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, um, the way that they grow the
plants so close together and when they're
[SPEAKER_02]: in full flower, the leaves tend to go a
little bit more thinner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see this outdoors anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow the same thing indoors and
outdoors and you see them more true,
[SPEAKER_02]: true growth pattern of it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I grow say orange soda inside,
it doesn't have super thin leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then when you grow it outside,
the leaves always come out thinner and you
[SPEAKER_02]: can see it's real sativa and it looks like
a sativa, like that Christmas tree type of
[SPEAKER_02]: structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The growth conditions and how they farm
them and all of this really, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: plays a big role on how the plant looks as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the highest you went up to
eventually?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, two and a half thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what we went up to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd have to double check on my notes and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're, as we were growing up,
I was, you know, writing down the altitude
[SPEAKER_02]: and things like that at a certain point
where I'd get in the seeds and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's the good thing about these,
um, smartphones.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my friends had a smartphone so we
could like just keep checking everything
[SPEAKER_02]: where we were and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even write it down on the GPS if
you really wanted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can dot the locations where you
exactly found them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just drip in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's sick.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's the end goal with these Landro
seeds?
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously probably do a seed increase,
but what do you want to work it into?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, the also while we were there,
the guy from Afghanistan, he brought some
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghan seeds with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, I don't know if you've checked his
page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen his page?
[SPEAKER_02]: This, uh, Afghan Kush black honey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got some amazing, amazing plants
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've just been growing some of those
seeds out and found a really nice male and
[SPEAKER_02]: I've pollinated it with the Bubba Kush,
the Cherry Cookie, the Sour Neo,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mandarino.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm going to be doing next
is testing them out and seeing how they
[SPEAKER_02]: come out and working that Afghan into
some, maybe some other lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to do some selections from the
Indian thing and stuff I've collected and
[SPEAKER_02]: work the Afghan into some of them as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's going to be a lot of
testing and it's going to be really
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just learning always this plant teaches me
so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like truly like a teacher plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've learned so much from it,
you know, from electrics and photography
[SPEAKER_02]: and growing plants, nutrition,
everything you can possibly imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so many people forget this and
just see the money nowadays instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: like having that real passion to learn
about this plant.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I mean, the adventure you described,
there's a lot of passion involved in that,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I just wanted to quickly ask,
like, how do you feel having had these
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of whirly experiences with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: How does it make you perceive just
everyday cannabis now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it just hammer home that feeling of
like the whole polyhybrid thing or is it
[SPEAKER_06]: just refreshing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I still love polyhybrids, but I think
when you're talking about real breeding,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, it's like, the scene nowadays,
it's like loads of people trying to breed
[SPEAKER_02]: from mongrel dogs and expecting something,
um, like coming out like totally stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I say stable, I mean like coming
out uniform or looking exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got like so much variation in our
gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which is a good thing as well,
but I think we really do need to go back
[SPEAKER_02]: towards these, um, land race things and
create maybe like a new skunk number one
[SPEAKER_02]: or something like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to definitely work with the
indica lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe when that they've worked,
worked those lines a little bit more out
[SPEAKER_02]: into the city, but to create something
that's all totally from land race,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, and that comes out like, uh,
a breeding line should come out,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I still love polyhybrids and I love
the variation and I love using all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different things, even cookies and some
cherry pie and things like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all really nice, unique,
um, terpium profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think I love them all really,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's talk making a new skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've tried to bring this up in the past
and no one wants to go there with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What genetics would be involved?
[SPEAKER_06]: In quote the new skunk?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think it's going to be?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was two ways I was looking at
it, basically using two sativa lines and
[SPEAKER_02]: then adding the Afghan to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but now I'm looking towards more to
hash line, to hash plant lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a Milana hash plant and a Afghan
hash plant and working that line and then
[SPEAKER_02]: adding the sativa to it to, to add that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that bigger structure,
the bud structure, the, um, calyx to leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: ratio and things like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it could be interesting, but this is
all going to be told, like, it's all going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be experimental at first because really
don't know what the outcome is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might cross them together and then just
totally be like, I really don't like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to start again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but it's all going to be really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'd either use Afghan the Afghans
got to go in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a key.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main key to so many things from the
past.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe some of the sativa I'd use,
it'd be probably something from South
[SPEAKER_02]: America.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a wakhan type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like something like an maybe Acapulco gold
type of strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it exist anymore?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it exist?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think things could be found
from the areas and we could, things can be
[SPEAKER_02]: found in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it can be, it can be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one thing I have got from really old
seeds are my Malawi seeds that a friend
[SPEAKER_02]: collected for me from Malawi.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'd be another interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: African sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, again, I, I just really need a
nice big, um, greenhouse and one two years
[SPEAKER_02]: to just grow out the suitcase of seeds
that I've got of all the different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be the next plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next plan may be Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Caribbean is looking good at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So out of, uh, the genetics, we haven't
spoken about, you know, non-land raised
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's some of the new stuff you're
excited to work with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my, some of the new things I'm working
with, the Sourneo is going to be something
[SPEAKER_02]: really special.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be the next sort of new
release.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from what I released from last year
and that is the Lilt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone's really loving that and the
cherry spice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they're just both absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cherry spice is probably my favorite after
the Sourneo and the Lilt is just so
[SPEAKER_02]: unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Lilt, like people have been asking
a lot, like what's in the Lilt and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the father was a jungle Kush and the
mother was a cross of pineapple and
[SPEAKER_02]: something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that comes from Sonic and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that I didn't mention
too much about in the last one,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you were asking about some of the UK
clones and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: UK pineapple was a real special UK clone,
but after like so many years, it lost
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, um, some, sort of genetic
drift happened or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think tissue culture might be able to
bring that back though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been looking into that a lot
lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you heard of the concept of like a
plant being dotted?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what Sonic told me about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was, that's what I said to him,
maybe the tissue culture can help this out
[SPEAKER_02]: because then if it's some sort of illness
that someone's got in their plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can be, removed with tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if the dud in thing can
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he was telling me Bodhi was
talking to him about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bodhi was the one who told me about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, it's, you can look it up
because so the backstory is that a lab
[SPEAKER_06]: today or yesterday, I think it was put up
a post saying that, um, they've got like
[SPEAKER_06]: this patent pending process where it's
basically, you know, Meristem culturing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they reckon that, yeah, they can
definitely undo a plant that's dotted.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and what dudding is, is like,
there's this actual, um, I think it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: bacteria, might be a virus.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, or even a fungi.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just cover all my bases.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it's, it's one of them and,
and the government like literally was
[SPEAKER_06]: spraying it over California for a while.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it gets in your plant, it just gets
in the systemic system and the plants just
[SPEAKER_06]: fucked forever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like they, they just wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to kill the weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way they don't have to spray
pesticides that harm the bees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've been releasing these in places
where people grow weed in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now all of a sudden they're
having big problems with broad mites and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just like just seems like it's just
crazy that they would even release them
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you said about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: They definitely did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what they would also do is I think I
read a little bit about this and they
[SPEAKER_06]: would go along every so often and spray
some pesticides on the mites like to kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of fight them at bay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so they just bred like the Borg
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see it like even in Holland and places
like this where the mites built a
[SPEAKER_02]: resistance to so many different sprays.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, this is what will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We better pull it back in before we go to
Alex Jones on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Lilt seems to be extremely popular,
you know, and you mentioned the unique
[SPEAKER_06]: terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you describe the terpene
profile?
[SPEAKER_06]: And are you going to kind of find a male
and work it forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm going to definitely work the
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the moment, I'm getting really high
percentages of that phenom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really happy with that release.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody seems to be getting from a
10 pack, they'll be getting at least four
[SPEAKER_02]: of the phenoms like the mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other things are maybe like a
slight watered down version tropical
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are finding like a slight
fruity tropical cushy thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one was really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that one was almost better than
the actual mother because it had this like
[SPEAKER_02]: cushy with the tropical taste,
which was really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the main flavor from the Lilt is like
if you get a tropical juice, which has got
[SPEAKER_02]: passionflower and pineapple in it,
that's the dominant smell that I smell off
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while the plant is growing,
it's by far the smelliest plant that
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll come across in your room,
but in a sweet, gentle sort of not like a
[SPEAKER_02]: strong, stinky way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a beautiful smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just love going into the room and
literally just smelling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when it comes out as a dried bud,
the smell is less in your face and a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more subtle.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you smoke it, you're left with
this like tropical taste on the tongue,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a tropical juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic says it's like tin tropical fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how he describes it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I describe it like a tropical juice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so do you have any kind of plans in
the works with Sonic?
[SPEAKER_06]: So are you guys just kind of trading
clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yeah, we're definitely going to be
doing more work together in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's going to be definitely bringing
out more pineapple crosses, looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: Kali, Snapple, the Persang.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's going to be a lot of
Sonic stuff coming out of the next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so do you plan to continue working
with the Mandarin or is that kind of doing
[SPEAKER_06]: its thing on the back burner while you do
some Lilt and other things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything takes so much time and space
and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, sometimes you have to just put
something aside for the time being.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the mandarina will be, the next lot
will be a feminized cross to bring back
[SPEAKER_02]: like the orange soda, the gingerbread.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else was there?
[SPEAKER_02]: The mandarina kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think maybe I can imagine a lot of
them being grown out in Morocco and places
[SPEAKER_02]: like this because they loved all the hash
coming from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they're great for the hash
production and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the jungle kush hybrids in general
appear to be pretty well received.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your overall impression of them in
retrospect?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if you could only kind of recommend
one to me, which one would you recommend
[SPEAKER_06]: besides the obvious choice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cherry spice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be the one.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should put a caveat and ruled that out
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I really liking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already said about the sourneo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go into more detail about the
sourneo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sourneo, that's something really special.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so that was made using Horty lab's
sour power clone and the sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was selected by Karma from ResDog's
IBL sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's the one he's done that BX2
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the time when we were working
together, that's when those seeds were
[SPEAKER_02]: made and they were like a little limited
release.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did a selection from those seeds,
but they were all coming out very like
[SPEAKER_02]: sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there was one very unique one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which had this like sour twang,
but it smells like grapefruit slightly
[SPEAKER_02]: when it's growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when it finishes off,
you can't really smell the grapefruit in
[SPEAKER_02]: it anymore and it turns into this like
sour antiseptic smell, which is like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm smoking some of the
outdoor from last year of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's probably my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the prettiest plant to look at,
like structure wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the flavor is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the extract made from it is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The high is so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke a few joints of that in the
evening and you're having the best sleep
[SPEAKER_02]: of your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: All around a great plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've crossed that with my jungle kush
to make the sourneo.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a real special one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The jungle kush male as well is just not
very dominant in the crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get mainly the phenos from the
mother side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I crossed it with a passion
flower, everything comes out like smelling
[SPEAKER_02]: like that tropical passion flower sort of
smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I crossed it with the cherry cookie,
everything comes out like that cherry
[SPEAKER_02]: cookie type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a really good male to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used it to cross with a few other
things to make like the ryan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first line was rose water cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what ryan is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was crossed with the jungle kush to
make the hundred hand slap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a male from the hundred hand slap
was used to go back to the ryan to make
[SPEAKER_02]: the back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like a new line that I'm just
really releasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also got a clone that I selected,
which is a ryan clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's been passed around as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should see a lot more of that
around this coming year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how would you describe the profile on
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people say it's like the Mac,
but with a bit more turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like how I would describe it is like,
slight berry, but with like this cookie
[SPEAKER_02]: thing in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can definitely taste that there's
like, there's some like almost kush in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not dominant in any one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's not just pure gas or it's not
just pure kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can taste all these different under
notes with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so it's a great one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I named that after my mother,
because just when you grow it in the room,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just stands out from everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: The growth pattern on it is a little bit
more unusual.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the branches sort of all come up to a
set sort of place and it stays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't branch outwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't like to grow wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite a sort of slender type plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so the question I always have to ask,
what kind of techniques are you using to
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of identify your breeding males?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the main things with,
I think selecting the males, especially
[SPEAKER_02]: over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you've grown so many different
plants over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've probably got thousands of
different plants and different smells and
[SPEAKER_02]: structures and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get to see so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think a lot of it just comes from,
past experience, past knowledge,
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then obviously after all of that,
the stem rub, the structure of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm looking for a short structure and I
want to make something with a short
[SPEAKER_02]: structure, then I'm going to select the
male with that more shorter structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like little simple things like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think genetically is one of the main
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The male has to have come from plants that
the females are all very stable in,
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're all very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you know that the male is going to
be very similar to the females.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're picking a male from a pack of
seeds that has got so many different
[SPEAKER_02]: variations and phenos, then it's going to
be harder to select, especially a terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: profile from that male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think terpene profile is one of my
main things with my last lots of breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to get, if it's something
like lilt, then I want them all to be like
[SPEAKER_02]: lilt and smelling tropical.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I want the cherry spice, I want them
all with that cherry spiced gas sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the lines I sort of go down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how many seeds do you like to pot when
you're looking to find your new male?
[SPEAKER_02]: It varies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can select a male from one packet of
seeds because I'm usually picking a male
[SPEAKER_02]: from something that I've created myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I already know both parents that have
been grown out from many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know those plants like the back of
my hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how they've worked previously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I'm using stuff, it's normally
stuff that I've already made myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what about if you're going to use
someone else's stock, how many packs would
[SPEAKER_06]: you want to grab?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least a couple of packets.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then if I'm not finding really good
females from one packet, do I really want
[SPEAKER_02]: to use a male from that packet to see what
I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously, if you're going to do a
nice selection, I'd be like 30 plants to
[SPEAKER_02]: do a nice selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as like a bit of a follow up to
that, how many seeds of each strain,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you had to guess, would you say
generally get popped before you would say
[SPEAKER_06]: a strain is ready for market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I've grown it out and two or three
friends have said they really like it,
[SPEAKER_02]: then that's like ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the last ones, all them would really
just test it by me and one friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: The previous ones, they were done by a lot
more people.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm finding when I do actually ask
people to test things, some people can be
[SPEAKER_02]: quite slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm literally just quicker to test
things myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as I'm getting a test a couple
of packets and I'm getting really nice
[SPEAKER_02]: things from a couple of packets,
I'm happy with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when I want to start writing down
percentages of phenotypes and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, that's only going to come with more
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really limited by space, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I would like to be starting a
lot more seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You raise a really interesting point there
because a lot of breeders seem to be doing
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty much exclusively in-house testing,
much to the same reason you gave,
[SPEAKER_06]: that testers are kind of inconsistent
these days.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel about the idea that,
you know, a lot of packs that get sent out
[SPEAKER_06]: to be tested just end up being added to
someone's seed bank?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say how much I've sent
out of like test seeds and free seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're talking like a lot, a lot,
a lot and a small fraction of the
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage actually get grown out and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I find Spanish guys are really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll get a packet of seeds and they'll
grow them out.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the UK, if they get something for free,
yeah, that goes in their seed draw.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they paid $500 for that packet,
that's getting popped straight away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm definitely going to be doing a
different way of testing when I do to the
[SPEAKER_02]: public, I'm going to be using BreedBay in
the future a lot more, which is a forum
[SPEAKER_02]: that we used to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's now is the sort of time to
maybe push that a little bit more and
[SPEAKER_02]: start spending a bit more time on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are trying to grow from
Instagram and places like this where
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not enough knowledge and like they
need a place where people are happy to
[SPEAKER_02]: share knowledge, not going to like be
horrible to the person if they ask a silly
[SPEAKER_02]: question, because we were all young,
we were all learning at one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I think a place like that is
needed right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for expert growers and new growers,
so everybody can learn from each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a place where I can offer like little
limited releases to people to test out
[SPEAKER_02]: new lines that I'm about to release.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want them to just grow them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if I've tested them already,
it's good for other people to see it and
[SPEAKER_02]: see what they think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think BreedBay is going to be the
place where a lot more of this is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be good to see people grow them
out and do little grow logs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we used to do a lot more years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd see people grow them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd be talking about what pH their feed
and amount, how many milliliters of this
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient, how many mills of that nutrient,
exactly their temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd show it every week.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd update.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's needed now,
especially for anybody that's serious
[SPEAKER_02]: about growing, serious about even breeding
in the future once they've collected a
[SPEAKER_02]: really nice library and tested all that
stuff out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to share knowledge, like there's so
many things I've learned over the years
[SPEAKER_02]: and yeah, I'm happy to share all of this
with people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think BreedBay is going to be the new
place for this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like it's hard to get people back
on forums because it's like the idea has
[SPEAKER_06]: been thrown around a lot, but it seems
like you need more than just the forum to
[SPEAKER_06]: get people on there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think there'll be like other
breeders kind of getting on there,
[SPEAKER_06]: which would incentivize it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, Bodhi's already on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got his own little page.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't even know this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Professor P from Dynasty, he used to
be on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's still got his own section.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these guys will be posting a lot
more on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be going back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonic's going to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's going to be an interesting
little place, a little community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if it can get it going like it
used to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's enough new growth and
people that are serious about growing that
[SPEAKER_02]: would like to join and yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's got a little chat room on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every day people come in and have a
chat in the little room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions, they can see who's online.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can ask a little question and get the
answer without anybody else coming on and
[SPEAKER_02]: being horrible or missing the post because
you post a post on Instagram, but nobody
[SPEAKER_02]: really looks past a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The posts and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are just flicking nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas people want to be able to go back
somewhere, look at it and learn something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people need to be learning more,
reading more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We shall see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds G.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of on that topic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any plans to try to get your
genetics out kind of more into the
[SPEAKER_06]: international distribution streams?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Benson Elvis, which is like a big
farm in America, they already grow the
[SPEAKER_02]: orange soda, Mandarin and Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing the lilt now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to be doing more of the
jungle juice and they're popping the
[SPEAKER_02]: cherry spice and things like that next.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been getting their product
made into extract and yeah, they're all
[SPEAKER_02]: loving over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think just more people need to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think once more people try it,
then we're going to see this burst of
[SPEAKER_02]: trichome jungle tips.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a lot more people growing out
the lilt lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been some nice batches of it
available in some of the social clubs in
[SPEAKER_02]: Barcelona and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's been really good to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've even seen Mandarin and Kush on the
menu in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said that lilt will be there
soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the little things that make me
smile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when people enjoy the love and work
that I put into everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of in that same vein, this is one
I've been pondering a bit myself lately.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you believe like a breeders
responsibility over their genetics extends
[SPEAKER_06]: past the whole site?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like for example, if someone has an issue
with your seeds, is it kind of your job or
[SPEAKER_06]: the wholesalers job to fix that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I always tell the wholesaler to tell
them to send me a message direct on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram or my email because that way,
like I try to answer every single message
[SPEAKER_02]: I get because I know what it was like when
I was a much younger and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I was able to speak to a breeder,
I think that would have been an amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So someone is growing out my seeds and
they've paid money to buy those seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: support me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a little bit part of my job
to try my best to answer as many questions
[SPEAKER_02]: as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if someone is going to write me a
question, I prefer to actually,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they write me a question, not just
like, hi, how are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's hard to go through so many
messages, but if there's a question there
[SPEAKER_02]: that I can look, read, read it through a
couple of days later, okay, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Answer that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's much easier for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I enjoy doing it as well,
especially if I have the extra time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't mind doing it at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do you handle complaints by
customers?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if someone were to contact you and
said they'd grown your gear out and they'd
[SPEAKER_06]: have some sort of issue, maybe let's say
it's like hermed out or whatever,
[SPEAKER_06]: is your first response to kind of like,
you know, see if maybe something's up with
[SPEAKER_06]: the garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't really too many get too
many, but let's see somebody might message
[SPEAKER_02]: me saying about germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get this a lot of germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now all my seeds are fully tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: I test them like on a regular basis as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, they, there's no problem with
germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I will ask the person like,
you know, try and figure out what their
[SPEAKER_02]: problem was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see in winter time, we get a lot more
problems with germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just shows that it is environment
stuff, but I will try to send them a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of extra seeds to try and make up
for that just so they're happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want everybody to be happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone said to me something hermed and
they sent me some pictures and all of
[SPEAKER_02]: this, I might be inclined to send them a
packet so they are happy at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think a lot of things comes down to
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grow out so many different varieties
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must come across this yourself,
even in packs that have been, you've grown
[SPEAKER_02]: out, grown out, and then maybe you might
find one that herms or puts out some
[SPEAKER_02]: bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does happen, especially if you're using
things like sour diesel, cherry pie,
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that, which have a tendency to
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I can send them a packet of seeds
and make them happy, then I will do this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers Groma.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, what type of lighting are you
using at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I got them a couple of years
ago, I'm just still using them at the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I get my new place, they'll be
changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been looking into some LEDs at the
moment as well, because I'm seeing some
[SPEAKER_02]: quite good results with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to just try them out myself,
just as a little test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that could be something good for
the future with the energy consumption and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But outdoors is the way, using the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how are things in Spain at the moment?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the laws evolving to kind of cater more
to breeders, or is it still a case of
[SPEAKER_06]: like, you know, out of sight, out of mind
type of thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like that basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a few little run-ins and yeah,
not the best of luck, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, they're still far from being
legal out here, so far from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like Amsterdam, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they have all that in the coffee
shops, but how it's produced is all a gray
[SPEAKER_02]: area, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: So what country would you recommend
aspiring breeders to look to if they were
[SPEAKER_06]: going to relocate?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because people often talk about Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spain is definitely going to be the
future, I can see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the moment, yeah, I think there's
still a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you look to America, and they've
gone legal there, and everyone's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh no, they've gone legal now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think how Spain's got it with the
clubs, I think they just need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: accepted.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can be accepted by a court of law,
and the production for the clubs can be
[SPEAKER_02]: accepted, and some papers can be brought
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's almost like decriminalizing it to
some extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that could really work.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that being said, do you see a
viable future for a person from like a
[SPEAKER_06]: currently illegal country to move to
Spain, try to set themselves up,
[SPEAKER_06]: create themselves a job in the industry
over there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you just think it's too prohibitive
to just do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think anybody should come out to Spain
first and check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see how they feel about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spend a few weeks here, see the clubs,
speak to the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think most people would be able to
judge it themselves and how they feel
[SPEAKER_02]: about the situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you approach it with the view of
like a producer or a breeder?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in my mind, it seems like you
could just kind of be off in the
[SPEAKER_06]: background doing your own thing,
and hopefully no one bothers you,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I've tried to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I live really out in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a tiny little place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stand out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I've drawn attention to myself
and the police have asked questions and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had to pack things down and move
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a lot of hassle for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's worked out good in the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: How it's portrayed on the internet,
like Spain is this totally legal place and
[SPEAKER_02]: you can grow weed here and stuff like
that, was how it was portrayed to me when
[SPEAKER_02]: I first moved here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found out very quickly that it
wasn't like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to play devil's advocate for a
moment here.
[SPEAKER_06]: If for some reason you had to leave Spain
and move to another country, which one
[SPEAKER_06]: would you move to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: You say that like you're ready to do it
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Canada sort of does appeal to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see myself going there to live,
though, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the sunshine in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people are really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I can't see myself moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: To Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if anybody is free to do what
they want and they're looking at moving to
[SPEAKER_02]: a country, I think Canada, there could be
a lot of opportunities in Canada coming
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, given you are a breeder in
Spain, a little bit unrelated,
[SPEAKER_06]: but kind of, is there the same explosion
of breeders over there in the same sense
[SPEAKER_06]: that we see in America and the rest of the
world?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there has been a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm seeing some people, they're
getting like as many sort of clones as
[SPEAKER_02]: they come together or even just plants
that other people have selected and then
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinating them with a male or reversing
a plant and pollinating them and then
[SPEAKER_02]: selling the seeds, not tested,
never grown out any of the parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like, it's just for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, like there's a lot of people
making seeds now and putting any names.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's all gone a bit crazy,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what you sort of mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like lots of slight seed companies popping
up with no real testing and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, that's definitely one part
of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was also curious.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes you hear about like big seed
producers over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I think Dynafem does something over
there or something like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, do you know anything about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I don't know too much about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can imagine, yeah, there's a lot of
people over here producing seeds for their
[SPEAKER_02]: companies and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: The horror stories always relate back to
Spain somehow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there's a lot of people use Spanish
guys to make their seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, many of the big companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So while we're on the topic of going
through seeds, making parents,
[SPEAKER_06]: how many plants do you tend to cull before
you find like a keeper female?
[SPEAKER_06]: And when you find your kind of clone
onlys, does it happen often from a 10 pack
[SPEAKER_06]: or given you're at like, you know,
the higher breeder level, do you do these
[SPEAKER_06]: larger scale searches?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can do all your selection from a
10 pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends on what you're using that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said before, if you're not
finding really great things from a 10
[SPEAKER_02]: pack, like, yeah, you want to be finding
some real nice stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, if you're starting then from,
you find something special and you really
[SPEAKER_02]: want to look down that line more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting another 50, 100 seeds of that one
type is worth doing to find something
special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, and work that line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be doing a lot more work with
a little male soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll be a lot of little hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just done the little with the jungle
kush, but then this is more like a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of a back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more watered down and you get like
this fruity kush thing coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely want to add the little
with a few different things I've got
[SPEAKER_02]: planned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from them do some selection and
work lines the same as I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_02]: with the Afghan hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how they come out in the first
generation, but each line is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: really need to be worked to find
something, to get something that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: release.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to ask, what were the females of
the Afghan line like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The male smelled much better than the
females.
[SPEAKER_02]: The male had this like, a grapefruit smell
going on, but the females were more on,
[SPEAKER_02]: like how I said about the Indian spiced
aniseed smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had this thing, I could smell it in
the Afghans as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like this, it just reminds me of
like a lot of old school stuff I've had
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even my nap that I had in the past,
which made the mantis that had that
[SPEAKER_02]: aniseed like Hindu kush type smell going
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's definitely along those
lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you have any information about what
area the Afghans came from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're from Balkh province near Mazar
Sharif.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've got like, I've got some here,
but then between all of us now,
[SPEAKER_02]: he sent a lot more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've literally got seeds from every
province and place in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_06]: And which one excites you the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that I've got at the moment,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I'm going to be getting to a few
different, different ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some people are getting ones that are
like a lot more cabbage looking,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the leaves, like really, really fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and those ones were the, do you know
what, I'd have to go and look because I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't remember right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's somebody else that was growing
them that I seen on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_02]: but from the same farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he collected them from another farm in
another area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think this year is going to be
the year of the Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's going to be a lot of Afghan seeds
being grown out from different areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to be really interesting to
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already seeing so many different
variations from the different people
[SPEAKER_02]: growing them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So have you ever thought of like rounding
up a whole bunch of Afghan clones kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: doing like what Bodhi did with like the
deep line alchemy and like, just hitting
[SPEAKER_06]: all these Afghans with like this cool
Afghan battle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think there could be a lot of
different things going on and people
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing a little bit of pollen so they can
hit this one and things like this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this will be happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what type of satire do you want to
hit with the Afghan eventually?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Malawi seeds, I'm definitely going to
pop them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the South American stuff,
we'll see how they come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think Malawi, I don't know,
there's just something about that pack of
[SPEAKER_02]: Malawi that's just crying to me to pop
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what happens with them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think I've ever asked,
what would you use as the final satire
[SPEAKER_06]: component for your skunk?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe something South American again or a
Thai It all depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've got so many different things to
go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on the trips to India, there was
like, not just me, Sonic, there was a guy
[SPEAKER_02]: from Himalayan Connection, some other
guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've also got some real nice stuff
in their collection, things like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got so many different things to
pick from.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got like some real nice satires even
from India and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the library is very big at the moment
between all of us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to kind of play devil's advocate
then again, what type of genetics would
[SPEAKER_06]: you like to see come back into kind of the
community that kind of aren't really
[SPEAKER_06]: around at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some more nice, really fruity things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just things with something a little bit
more unusual terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's any like particular
line I'd like to bring back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see a lot more, maybe some of
Sonic's pineapple hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had one called Pine Queen, which was
absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he brings that back, it'll blow
people's minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'd like to see some of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the old school, I'd like to see some
hash plants coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'd like to work with the
Afghans and the Malana plants so we can
[SPEAKER_02]: make a nice hash plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so do you feel like it's inherently a
part of those plants that you get kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: that more CBN, more sedative type of high
or not necessarily?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, that's what I'm looking for in
this hash plant type thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that literally you get halfway
down that spliff and it just knocks you
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I think it's going to be
interesting with the Bubba Kush because
[SPEAKER_02]: the Bubba Kush has got that more medicinal
sedative type of high to it, especially if
[SPEAKER_02]: you just flower it out that extra week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's such a beautiful smoke and I've
crossed that with the Afghan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Spanabiss is next week, so a week
after.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might take a few of those seeds with
me to give out to a couple of people to
[SPEAKER_02]: test out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do like a release of the Lil
again there because they just sold out so
[SPEAKER_02]: fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody went crazy for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So doing another release of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll probably be working the line
a lot more then and doing some nice little
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to have your own booth at
Spanabiss?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I'm not going to be doing a booth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the booths have been already like
taken and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just doing like I did the previous
year where I'll do an evening event in a
[SPEAKER_02]: club each night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Friday night in one club, Saturday
night in another club and the final night
[SPEAKER_02]: in another club and just do little seed
release there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's good actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit more personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are coming there to like sort of
see you and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nice to talk to the people,
sit down, show them some of the different
[SPEAKER_02]: flower and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a really good evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm doing it in three different clubs
this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll still be at the expo in the
daytime.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like you're going to have to swing
by my buddy Lucky Dog Seeds, get some chem
[SPEAKER_06]: dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, SkunkVA.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, do you know what number B for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have to send me in a message after
if you find out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go get some of them hybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend sent me a bud.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out, Burke.
[SPEAKER_06]: A while back and I only just finished
smoking it today.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so strong.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just lasted me forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll have to check them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anyone else you want to check out
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just tend to go just to meet up with old
friends and some new friends and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's never, ever enough time to see
everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always somebody that I miss and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll try and see as many people as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a few clubs that have got some
lilt and stuff like that in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they told me to come by, have a look at
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it'll be interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be nice to see what people have
produced from the seeds from last year and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there people like selling clones there
and stuff like in the States or not
[SPEAKER_06]: really?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, nothing like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just like flower and concentrate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you go to just one of the social
clubs, be a member of the clubs and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get access to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most people sort of like bring their
own little bit of smoke and everyone's
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking quite openly and it's quite a
relaxed environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've heard High Times have just bought
it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Spannabis now has been bought by High
Times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from this year on, it's going to be
High Times or Spannabis High Times,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what they'll call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I could see it probably changing
a little bit after this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so how do you feel about High Times
owning it?
[SPEAKER_06]: You think like whatever or not good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, but I can't see it being,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, previous things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it all changes, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everybody is just all about
whoever pays the most gets the cup and all
[SPEAKER_02]: of this sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just all changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for 2020 Spannabis time, a few people I
know are going to put a nice little cup on
[SPEAKER_02]: at the same sort of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to be a nice like more
transparent cup anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll get to see all the boats and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be quite good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during Spannabis anyway, there's
always other little cups on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they've got the Masters of Rosin and
what's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Legends of Hash that Bubbleman and them
always put on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's always a little over events
going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it should be good for this year and
next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you ever get sick of any of the egos?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's always egos and it's getting
worse, but yeah, I just laugh.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes me smile and laughing is good for
your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if people make me laugh, yeah,
it's beneficial to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can imagine you'd have a blast at
one of those events.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always smiling.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how important do you think it is to
produce kind of medically potent strains?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm not just talking about CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, kind of like the example that's
been weighing in my mind is my good buddy
[SPEAKER_06]: Stray Fox.
[SPEAKER_06]: He pointed out that although the pre-98
Bubba is arguably a better smoke,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, probably no one will dispute
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Katsu we cut, it's far more medicinal,
you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that in mind, do you think it's
important that we like try to breed with
[SPEAKER_06]: these types of things like for the
medicinal value or do you think it's just
[SPEAKER_06]: of kind of inconsequential because the
markets just mostly wreck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think like I go down more the
flavor and stuff like because it's more
[SPEAKER_02]: the like that's what I like about it so
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the high really does come into it and
the Bubba is such a medicinal strain that
[SPEAKER_02]: whenever I crossed it into things in the
past, I'd always sort of put that in the
[SPEAKER_02]: description because every time you added
Bubba into things, the high of the
[SPEAKER_02]: offspring would always come out with that
beautiful Bubba type high added to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was definitely felt in the legs,
like such a relaxing type of smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people with back pain and things like
this, but yeah, enjoy it so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think so many people do use it
medicinally, but don't realize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We say recreational, but if it makes you
feel happy and your wellbeing is good,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's medicinal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it helps your stiff joints or you've
got a little bit of pain in the neck or it
[SPEAKER_02]: helps you to relax your body after work,
this is all medicinal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think so many people do actually use
it in a medicinal way, but don't actually
[SPEAKER_02]: realize it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so do you think there should be any
distinction or do you think just greater
[SPEAKER_06]: education?
[SPEAKER_02]: Greater education.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the main thing because we
even know even with your growing something
[SPEAKER_02]: from seed, it's not always going to be
exactly how you imagine it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get different variations in the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think educating people about all
these different compounds, genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: the terpenes, I think that's a big thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what field of research would you
like to see cannabis expand more into
[SPEAKER_06]: then?
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing, like just testing for terpenes
and all the other chemicals in the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like there's just so many things that
we come to conclusions, but we can never
[SPEAKER_02]: really fully back them up unless we test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think seeing a lot more testing and
tissue culture, I'd like to see how things
[SPEAKER_02]: go with the tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like we were talking about getting rid
of genetic diseases or getting rid of just
[SPEAKER_02]: normal diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the tissue culture, you're producing
a totally clean clone of the mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's one good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see so many people passing clones and
it's how you pass disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing I do not take in is clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you just, everything's from seed
more or less?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could actually, I all, everything
that I use now, the only clone that I have
[SPEAKER_02]: in my library right now is the Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything else is clones I've selected
myself from seed originally or new things
[SPEAKER_02]: I've selected from seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so I only do things I've
selected from seeds from now on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best way, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're, you're, you're clean
from any other external influences.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how long will it take you on average
before you find a new keeper?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like for example, if you're doing a crop
every, you know, let's just say three
[SPEAKER_06]: months to be on the easy number side,
you're finding one each cycle,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're finding two, you're finding one
every two cycles.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your numbers like?
[SPEAKER_02]: All depends on what I'm starting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from, if I'm starting 10 different
varieties, okay, I'll find three or four
[SPEAKER_02]: nice keepers, but then the other things
are still nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm finding, because then I'll pass them
out to people and they'll be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe you're getting rid of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be like, well, yeah, it's just,
it's not something that I'm going to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's so many keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm finding the more different
breeders that you pop things from as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You find so much different flavors and
smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So which breeders work?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you most excited to look into?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, do you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to got some stuff from Mad Pharma.
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent me some nice seeds over and I
haven't had the chance because they
[SPEAKER_02]: literally came at the time when I had all
the problems just after that where I had
[SPEAKER_02]: to move everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, I was about to pop
them, but I had to just give them a
[SPEAKER_02]: backseat for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I was, I had to just pop all my own
stuff because things just needed testing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but really I would have liked to have
popped some of his seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're next on the list, but I've got
a few things that I've picked out for the
[SPEAKER_02]: next run.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't, I did, they were picked out with
some other things for a run, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had to test all the other stuff,
all the things that I've been making.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a bad selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've noticed on your IG that you've
been playing around with some kind of cell
[SPEAKER_06]: culturing yourself some along those lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: What'd you been doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I class it more like micro cloning really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you're basically taking a small
amount of the plant tissue and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: grow it in a sugar solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plants making, instead of it doing
the photosynthesis and getting the sugar
[SPEAKER_02]: from the light is getting the sugar from
the solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you've got no bacteria in
there, then the bacteria can't grow on the
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar and eat the sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything has to be super sterile.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the main thing with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll grow it to tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: The root will calyx up, but then I'll
transfer to another solution, which will
[SPEAKER_02]: be then for the root growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reason I got into the tissue
culture was because I had to move
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I moved everything, I thought,
okay, if I'm going to do this,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get a tissue culture kit and
I'm going to do this as an extra backup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did two extra backups of tissue
culture and moved my mothers to a safe
[SPEAKER_02]: location.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so it all worked out and I
learned something new and I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: experimenting with that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of guys that I'm speaking
to on Instagram and one of them is so
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledgeable in this field and he's
bringing out a kit very soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's going to be something
that a lot of people will really enjoy
[SPEAKER_02]: using and experimenting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same again, like people looking beyond
just the money and want to learn more
[SPEAKER_02]: about the plant or plants in general,
the science behind them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think these kits are going to be
amazing for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's got he's done them so they're in
like a little bag and the bag is like a
[SPEAKER_02]: sterile environment, which is going to
really help people at the beginning stage
[SPEAKER_02]: of doing tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll be doing a post on my Instagram
page about that and I'm sure he'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: putting some links up about the kits and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe you can get him to send you one
so you can try it out if you've never
[SPEAKER_02]: tried it out yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the success rate on it like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've been getting pretty much 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only time I haven't is where I've
done little tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got one out and I breathed into
the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And close the lid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just simple things like this are going to
contaminate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to wear a mask and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first batch 10% got contaminated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second, second time, maybe 5%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, really I don't have
any problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've seen even seen in the labs where
they've got total sterile environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: they still have 5% sometimes losses and
stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it happens in the cleanest of
environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, but as long as you're doing
everything super clean, and that's why
[SPEAKER_02]: these kits are going to be really good
with the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got a sterile environment inside
the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going to be really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that sounds cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like you kind of getting down to
the point where you're almost doing the
[SPEAKER_06]: Meristem culturing yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have a plan to do that type of
thing or go to labs for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, this is what this other guy is.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like been experimenting with all of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and he's doing like talking about
literally cells, just floating in the
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even to the point where maybe even
breeding in test tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see where it all leads in the
future.
[SPEAKER_04]: Breeding in a test tube, geez,
IBF seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more, for me, it's more just
educating myself and learning these
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same again, like this plan was just
teaching me so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're going down the lines of like a
total new line of genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, all very interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Learning something new every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing I've been really
getting into my a little bit more creative
[SPEAKER_02]: side.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, spending a little bit more
time doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if you've seen in the new
Mahakala, just like a little limited thing
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done for spinovus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a little limited seed packet or
like little handmade.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were quite good doing them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen you've been getting your little
micro carpentry on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping busy, being creative, keeping the
mind busy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good with the plants and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes you need to express
ourselves in other ways and learn
[SPEAKER_02]: learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's good to learn something new
every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love learning.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got some weird questions,
but I want to bang them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So first one, when will we see a CBD
project from you?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's due.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe when things change in Spain and I
can, yeah, I'll find a location to start
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a lot more growing and breeding like
the CBD you can actually do out here and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have some friends that grow legal
CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it might be something in the future
that I could work with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But THC is one of my main things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the high that these plants produce
and that THC and the terpenes is just so
[SPEAKER_02]: special for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The CBD, I think there's other people in
other fields that make good CBD and can
[SPEAKER_02]: continue with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll stick with my terpene rich THC
plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, in a similar idea,
how do you think we as a community can
[SPEAKER_06]: cater to the casual smokers?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, like this is kind of stemming
from the fact how I was saying,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, like I've cut my consumption
down and God, just like, I can't even have
[SPEAKER_06]: more than one hit and I'm just gone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I need that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I feel like that old person
who's like, weed's too strong these days.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, I'm trying to figure out like,
how can you make kind of like more tangy
[SPEAKER_06]: type of strains where it like tastes good,
but doesn't destroy you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd like the lilt, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lilt's like this, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are some phenols that you smoke
and they just like knock you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I say the majority of the tropical
ones have this like beautiful,
[SPEAKER_02]: euphoric high air.
[SPEAKER_02]: People will be smoking it and people will
be giggling and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I think this is going to be the
perfect strain for summer and how we've
[SPEAKER_02]: got spring coming soon and summer just
around the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be a perfect strain
for those sunny days and summer
[SPEAKER_02]: activities, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is what 's needed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a bit of a weird one, but I wanted to
ask you your opinion because I think we've
[SPEAKER_06]: spoken about this in kind of the DMs,
but there was like a scientific paper
[SPEAKER_06]: which came out the other day and it's like
actually detailing how you can use
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis to help people wean off harder
drugs like meth and opioids.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that any surprise to you at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, because I've seen so many people
that have been in the cannabis community
[SPEAKER_02]: and ended up growing and this plant again
teaching them so much and they changed
[SPEAKER_02]: their way of life and the cannabis has
given them something else to keep their
[SPEAKER_02]: mind occupied, to give them a feeling that
they can relax and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see, I've seen it a lot where people
have had previous drug addictions and
[SPEAKER_02]: they've turned to cannabis and it's helped
them through even just growing the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: nevermind taking a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking a plant has helped them amazingly,
but growing it, the whole thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: the therapeutic use and the therapeutic
property you get from just gardening,
[SPEAKER_02]: changing a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what type of grow style have you been
using lately?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the last batch, these are all bio
tabs with the seeds that I'm doing and the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones before that were all on cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was running some tests with pH and
stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Afghan is definitely like a much
higher pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a handy thing with Instagram,
both the guy from Milana village is on
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram, the farmer and the guy from
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can actually like message him or get
my other mate to message the other guy
[SPEAKER_02]: because he can speak to him in his
language and get some answers and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's been quite interesting,
but it's not something that they really
[SPEAKER_02]: check is the pH and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from a little bit more discussion,
I found that it's much higher pH there and
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that with growing them here,
they just really reacted better with a
[SPEAKER_02]: much higher pH.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what other little interesting nicks or
quirks have you found about them,
[SPEAKER_06]: which you kind of helped cater to?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like they're like a higher soil
temperature or like medium, I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that I was doing with them,
I started some of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Left them at low, low level light above
the, below the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to see how they react and plucked a
few out of the soil, stripped the roots
[SPEAKER_02]: down and replanted them and they still
grew here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just shows how hard these plants
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pull a plant out of the soil,
break all the small tiny roots off where
[SPEAKER_02]: you just leave in the main tape room,
replant it and the plant carries on
[SPEAKER_02]: growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is just a little test to show how,
to see how hard some of these genetics are
[SPEAKER_02]: that are grown in these places at these
altitudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think adding them into some of my
genetics and growing them outdoors,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is where I'm going to see,
I didn't see one bit of powdery mildew in
[SPEAKER_02]: all of their fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen powdery mildew on other plants
around them, but not on the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: not one spot anywhere, which was
absolutely crazy, I thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas when people go to Morocco,
it's everywhere there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these hybrids that people grow in
places have problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the natural varieties from that
area don't have the problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this is going to be something
to look into, resistant strains for the
[SPEAKER_02]: future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, definitely something of huge
interest to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to pull you back to something you
said there though, the Moroccan Valley,
[SPEAKER_06]: two questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, do you think a lot of the hash that
comes out of their, his coming from plants
[SPEAKER_06]: with PM and like, you know, I guess we
should be worried.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other thing is, have you seen
that photo from the DNA guys, how they got
[SPEAKER_06]: like that Valley in the rift full of like
kosher tangerine or something?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, how do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, see, well they had a load of
mandarina things, gingerbread out there at
[SPEAKER_02]: one point and mandarina kush and stuff
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been happening for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Amnesia not long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before that it was some Pakistani strains
that they were growing and Mexican strains
[SPEAKER_02]: and people were saying cheese,
they were growing loads of cheese out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things have been grown out there for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole hashish thing in Morocco isn't
like it goes back generation after
[SPEAKER_02]: generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new thing that was started from
people bringing seeds back from other hash
[SPEAKER_02]: producing countries and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's just a progression I think,
and that's what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to produce more hash and these
hybrids do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to Jamaica, it's all hybrids in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, this happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: How accountable do you hold Dutch genetics
and the Dutch breeders for these issues?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Dutch seed market was a big part
of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at one time it was only Dutch seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't really any American companies
or anybody else around to buy seeds from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could say DNA, are they American or
are they Dutch?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're American, but their company
was in Holland.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, they bought seeds from the Dutch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's where they could buy seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if they're from Dutch or
from Spanish people or they'll buy the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds, I think, to grow out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I've even heard that they grow
the seeds out one year and the second year
[SPEAKER_02]: they grow the seeds from those seeds,
but the third year they don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, and that's getting pollinated by
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's all a bit, it's just hash
production, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing, I suppose,
when you start going legal, we move away
[SPEAKER_02]: from that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a bit crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So unrelated?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, kind of related.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you plan to make a variety of other
feminized seeds or just kind of the
[SPEAKER_06]: one-off clone here and there that really
proves itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I want to make some more
feminized seeds because people,
[SPEAKER_02]: they want those orange turps, sort of
mandarin turps in feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said before, I can probably see
them being grown out in Morocco and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, Tanji, there's some Tanji
over there and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Another little indoor type of question.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your prediction for the future of
the lighting technology?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see a lot more people going over
towards LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think just for power consumption and
stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, like I said before, though,
I've been using Gevitas, but I'll probably
[SPEAKER_02]: change soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking into a few different ones
myself at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lumitech, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what I go for.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So a bit of a hot topic at the moment in
the community, but how do you feel about
[SPEAKER_06]: the idea of patenting genetics and strains
within the industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do you kind of think this would
work in regards to your own work?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think patenting anything in this day and
age is all bullshit, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a plant at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if someone buy the seeds off you,
or if we're talking clones, it all depends
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be a very hard
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have a court case over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just more unneeded stress,
I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to ask you one other
question about when you're in India.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you at any point kind of think of any
modern hybrid where you thought this would
[SPEAKER_06]: do well here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I wouldn't want to take
anything there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you know that they would start
growing it here and you know they would
[SPEAKER_02]: save the seeds from it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think taking anything there would
sort of destroy their genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think keeping it as it is is the best
way and not to take anything there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think a lot of things would do well
there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I meant more like theoretically,
like is there any clones in your library
[SPEAKER_06]: that you like just could off the top of
your head be like, yeah, that'd do well
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Persang Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Persang Haze from Sonic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I worked with that line a bit and
sort of field full of that up there would
[SPEAKER_02]: be absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you feel about the idea of kind
of these genetically modified strains to
[SPEAKER_06]: have like specific cannabinoid and terpene
profiles?
[SPEAKER_02]: In what way genetically modified?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like proper genetically modified you're
talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's any need for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can do it all with selection,
time and space.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that I would agree with
you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'd be interesting to see how it all
plays out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did want to ask one question about
the cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: I should have asked it earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how we kind of implied like some
cups, it's kind of pay to play or pay to
[SPEAKER_06]: win.
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you feel if one of those cups
that you really thought was kind of like,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, you got to pay to get somewhere,
like you just won.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would it restore your faith in the
competition?
[SPEAKER_06]: We'd be like, I guess it's not rigged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would probably change my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I tend to see is like third place
tends to be the real sort of like the
[SPEAKER_02]: winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first two are the people that have
like paid the most for sponsorship or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, if that happened, yeah,
I'd be, I thought we'd have to look at it
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something I wanted to ask you,
what's the weirdest plant mutation you've
[SPEAKER_06]: ever seen?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one that I see a lot is like,
you know, the flat stem thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Plant fasciation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way you get like the almost like
the Mohawk style, but at the top or like
[SPEAKER_02]: four stems where they should be two and
stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've seen a lot of like where you get
the bud growing from the middle of the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The I seen one recently, I think it was in
age next put it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like a leaf with like,
actually on the actual leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: not in the center of the leaf on the
leaves itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was little budlets coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So little calyxes growing from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've recently had a male with a male
parts growing from the center of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was some guys growing one line I
can't remember a freak show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called freak show.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've seen this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one was absolutely crazy,
but I've never come across anything like
[SPEAKER_02]: that myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had things come out similar to like
the duck spot where they have that like
[SPEAKER_02]: webbing almost on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think they're the sort of main
mutations that I've come across.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just in case anyone wasn't aware of that
freak show thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can go look it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I found most interesting was it
actually that plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there was a male or two that
also had similar traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually came from a pack of coastal
seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shout out Bob and the crew over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was like a, what was it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Big Sur hybrid.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause Big Sur is like a weird one already.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like some people think it's kind of auto
flowering, even though it's like a photo
[SPEAKER_06]: period one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we need to push some of these
weird genetics a bit harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spoke to those guys with the freak show,
but they're working that line themselves
[SPEAKER_02]: doing some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'd be interesting to pop some of
those seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think definitely people need to,
when they find that, maybe work it a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they, so it actually becomes a little
bit of a unusual line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's just more for like just the
fun and educational side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it can have a place where it could
be grown where people don't want the
[SPEAKER_02]: typical leaves to be seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe that's the only,
I think, purpose it could be used for
[SPEAKER_02]: really.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a better version of Australian
bastard cannabis, the ABC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I'm pretty confident this freak show
one's probably got a better high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were saying it's got some nice turps
to it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but I can see a lot of people wanting
to buy that still, you know, just to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: it out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something, something that inspector
from CSI has taught me is that as little
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial value as some of these
mutations may have, they're still very
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting and worth preserving and
trying to progress because who knows
[SPEAKER_06]: what's locked inside and which may be of
use later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that collects seeds, I'm sure
they'd want to buy a packet maybe to put
[SPEAKER_02]: in their library or something like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or as we were talking at last time,
they collect a pack to test and it ends up
[SPEAKER_06]: in the library.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh gosh.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you feel like viruses specific to
cannabis are going to increase given,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the large scale
commercialization that's going to occur
[SPEAKER_06]: throughout the world in the coming years?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think breeding may be more resistant
strains and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I've been even looking into is
like breeding a line that's can produce
[SPEAKER_02]: the same amount and same growth rates on
less water and less nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like almost like an eco weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'll be maybe something for the
future.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was almost like trying to get that
trait out of hemp and put it back into the
[SPEAKER_06]: medicinal cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's always like, I think,
like you said, the commercial thing is
[SPEAKER_02]: always going to bring more problems and
those problems will become resistant to
[SPEAKER_02]: things that people use and yeah,
stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So harder to get rid of in the end,
which is a, which will be a big problem I
[SPEAKER_02]: can see.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that being said, if you were given
the opportunity to grow a field of say
[SPEAKER_06]: Lilt or Mandarina in the Moroccan Rift
Valley, would you capitalize on it or
[SPEAKER_06]: would it be a hard pass?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people are going to buy the seeds
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether they buy them from Morocco or
Spain, the seeds get sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they've already done some Mandarina
Kush out there and what else was it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange soda and I'm trying to think what
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gingerbread.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's been a few things growing out
there and people send me photos and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how would you predict that it would
change the overall effect of those plants?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because earlier on you mentioned that,
you know, when you got some seeds from the
[SPEAKER_06]: mountains and grew them back here,
they were much more kind of squat and
[SPEAKER_06]: indica like compared to when they're in
the mountains.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the reverse situation, how do you
think your plants would come out when
[SPEAKER_06]: growing there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think they'd be more sativa or
yeah, give us your ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a little bit, but the gingerbread is
a little bit more indica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instructor anyway, the other ones are a
bit more sativa, but the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, they retain terpenes so well with
the conditions that they grow them and dry
[SPEAKER_02]: them and all of this sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it puts up with those conditions and to
make some of the best hash that's come out
[SPEAKER_02]: of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, I think one of the guys got
the first place in the Monsters Cup in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Spannabis last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, amazing hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing hash gets produced from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what strain so far that you've been
able to experience makes the best hash?
[SPEAKER_02]: The gingerbread and the orange soda.
[SPEAKER_02]: The orange soda from La Collada.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was some amazing hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, so what are kind of some of the
old school strains of yesteryear that
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd like to see come back?
[SPEAKER_02]: The Afghanis, they're coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen so many people growing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to see a lot more old
school hash plants, I think, coming back
[SPEAKER_02]: these coming years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I even can see some of the old sativas
coming back just because of the high that
[SPEAKER_02]: they produce because yeah, something
special in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can see the sativas coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them may be like old African
stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that it's arguably inevitable
that we do move towards a more sativa
[SPEAKER_06]: orientated customer base within the
community, given that, of course,
[SPEAKER_06]: depressants in general, alcohol,
opioids, there's a huge market for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when I look at things globally,
it seems like overall more people
[SPEAKER_06]: worldwide are kind of into stimulants than
into depressants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think a lot of people that I know
like the more indicous just because they
[SPEAKER_02]: use it to relax.
[SPEAKER_02]: They use it to chill out, maybe get into
like artwork.
[SPEAKER_02]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It puts you into like a more sort of
meditative sort of state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really like the sativas as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I just enjoy them for the daytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I find that I can really get into
anything that I'm doing, whether it be in
[SPEAKER_02]: the garden or in the house creating
something or cooking or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just really get fully into it with
the sativas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's your favorite sativa?
[SPEAKER_02]: From my lines at the moment, I like the
high from the lilt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a sort of beautiful up high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really sort of gets mind flowing,
creative.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but from the past, I liked Sonics
Persang Haze.
[SPEAKER_02]: That for me sort of just was such a
beautiful smoker.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such like up high again, sort of gets the
mind thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really, really nice one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to talk to you about hazes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the term haze is used as a general
term, because obviously not every haze has
[SPEAKER_06]: the original haze or even necessarily a
derivative haze in it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you just feel like haze is kind of a
term for like a few land race sativas kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of doing their thing together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think haze now seems to be any
sativa that smells a certain way with this
[SPEAKER_02]: like hazy spicy sort of smell that people
sort of associated with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I find like a lot of things have
that similar sort of spice, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: more on that dry side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, they vary.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that terpene profile is so common,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_06]: That haze one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember being able to smoke some of
what was it?
[SPEAKER_06]: The C5 haze with Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the first thing that came to mind when
I exhaled it, I was like, who would have
[SPEAKER_06]: thought, you know, C5 haze tastes like
haze?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the one I was smoking a bit of?
[SPEAKER_02]: The C4, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a C4?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It could well be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there's quite a few different
ones, but like they all have that
[SPEAKER_02]: underlining, yeah, haze, terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like a spiced thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I would describe it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, more spiced than just a pure
mango thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you smell it, you immediately
kind of go, yeah, this is where it all
[SPEAKER_06]: delineates from, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you see that smell in so many like
different non-races as well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've come across that in so many different
lines, from like Caribbean and Colombian,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of Colombian stuff over that way,
and South American stuff I've smelled it
[SPEAKER_02]: from.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, OK, South American.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's one that hasn't really been too
delved into.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that something you're looking to
explore at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: What, a little trip to South America?
[SPEAKER_06]: If needs to happen, it's got to happen,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll be talking about a trip to
Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Afghan black, he's saying come out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alex is well up for it from Land Race
Legacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, there might be a little
Afghanistan mission going on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, true.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because when we're at the Emerald Cup and
I was talking to a few different people
[SPEAKER_06]: along with Alex from Land Race Legacies,
it was interesting because they were,
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was actually Kagu who was
saying to me, oh, you know, this guy's got
[SPEAKER_06]: a British passport.
[SPEAKER_06]: He can go to Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_06]: He kind of made the point, you know,
it's a lot harder for US guys to go there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we need to get our butts over
there and make it happen.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'll stand out quite a bit over
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my only worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking to my dad, his first reaction
was no, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for anyone who's not aware,
Banana Man's got a pretty comprehensive
[SPEAKER_06]: amount of tattoos.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, so what's the kind of one of the more
old school breeders whose work you really
[SPEAKER_06]: admire?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the work that DJ Shortz has done
with all of his stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the fact that like all the sort of
like the flow, the blueberry stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: this, they were all really good lines and
his breeding style, I think was was quite
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting to read about, especially at a
younger age.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you ever read any of the articles
where he spoke about selecting males while
[SPEAKER_06]: on psychedelics?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I haven't, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that one would be quite interesting
because I think this is a big thing for
[SPEAKER_02]: me, like on mushrooms and even on like
small amounts of DMT.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but repeatedly smoking and going in
like, yeah, they it's almost like the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants speak to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these substances guide you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's going to be interesting to
have a read on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have to send me some links.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, man, I'll dig it up for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess a pertinent question to ask is
our friend Afghan Black Honey Kush.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's come up a few times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know if he plans to do seed
increases or is more of just like an
[SPEAKER_06]: awesome contact?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I can imagine they're going to be some
seed releases going on and I can imagine
[SPEAKER_02]: Himalayan connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be probably doing some nice
seed releases.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he's got one going on right at the
moment, which a lot of some of the Afghan
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, they're going on now at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do you feel that will affect the
community?
[SPEAKER_06]: Having access to these pure land races?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to really help the
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be a really good
educational tool for for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's just like a dream almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like if I had access to some real
Afghan genetics when I was younger,
[SPEAKER_02]: direct from the farmer from Afghanistan,
like that's pretty amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you mentioned Baba Kush already,
as we want to kind of the old school
[SPEAKER_06]: clones you're a fan of.
[SPEAKER_06]: What other old school clones struck a
chord with you, whether you have them or
[SPEAKER_06]: not?
[SPEAKER_02]: The SFV.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Crowberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that we used to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just some seeds that came over.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the forum days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a guy called Monkey had done a
selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a real special plant,
the Crowberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some real nice things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Lemon Larry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lemon Larry OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a real nice special one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the East Coast Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always, always such an amazing plant and
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think those ones from from back in
the day of the clones on the forum times.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Crowberry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's what's inside that one genetically?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, it's Granddaddy Purple crossed with
Blackberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I'd have to double check that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I ended up using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, look, memory goes as you get older.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used it for the Smurfberry cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, just such an amazing plant to
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like it would taste absolutely amazing
down to the roach with this like sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: berry smell, with that typical purple sort
of taste in the background.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like purple weed has a certain sort of
terpene almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like with that, with this more
berry tongue going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so many people grew that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was such a good plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you think will be basically the
next major flavor profile to take a hold
[SPEAKER_06]: on the scene?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people fruity stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: People seem to really be liking the Lilt
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm seeing more people bringing out
pineappley sort of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can see maybe that the pineapple terp
coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that might be a new one to
come back around.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see everything coming back around in
circles, it seems.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like fashion, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I remember it seems like gas strains
of like kind of snuck back in,
[SPEAKER_06]: but also kind of sneaking out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm waiting for the fruity stuff to
come back.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to agree with Gooey Breeder on that
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's where I think it's at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, fruity, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I'm at as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the fruity stuff's coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think everybody that's growing this Lilt
at the moment, I was so surprised with the
[SPEAKER_02]: smell myself when I found that Fino.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was literally just dancing in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, wow, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kept going back smelling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so nice to get those messages off
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just like, wow, I've never smelled
anything like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or this is like just pure tropical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Juice, papaya, people are saying,
one person was saying he smells like cream
[SPEAKER_02]: and strawberries with pineapple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like, wow, this is,
yeah, this is this is this is the terp
[SPEAKER_02]: that people are loving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you think about the rise of the
vape pens?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we've seen that glorious South
Park episode called The Pussy Sticks.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel?
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to me like it's the bridge
between the everyday Joe, who's not really
[SPEAKER_06]: a consumer and our community, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you feel like it's a good or a bad
thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think there's a lot of people
going to use them just because it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: so easy to use for the normal everyday
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think a lot of shitty material is
being used for them because I'm seeing if
[SPEAKER_02]: anything's really nice and flower form is
being sold as flower or maybe make it into
[SPEAKER_02]: extract or the really nice extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're using really nice flour and then
the lower grade extract using not so good
[SPEAKER_02]: flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it just goes down, down and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it seems to be like the shittiest
stuff is being used for edibles and these
[SPEAKER_02]: carts and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm seeing so many of the carts just
not passing tests in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Education again, education.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think a lot of the issues stemming
from those carts relates to people buying
[SPEAKER_06]: the actual housing units, the plastic and
the little cartridges themselves from
[SPEAKER_06]: China.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's, you know, a plethora of
associated issues with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that essentially this is
inevitable given that people selling these
[SPEAKER_06]: carts are looking to make money?
[SPEAKER_06]: Their game is profits despite the fact
they may try to claim it's all about the
[SPEAKER_06]: patience.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you think you deal with this
conundrum?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think more testing and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're saying then, if they're buying
the carts from China and they're releasing
[SPEAKER_02]: all those toxins into the stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, people just, it's more
education, more research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Into these things and maybe some more
guidelines that people need to be like
[SPEAKER_02]: sticking to when they are making these
products for a legal market.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel people can ascertain
whether the person they're buying off
[SPEAKER_06]: really has their best interests in mind?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think it's just like, you have to
know someone for a while?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is where like it goes back to
the whole thing of go into a farmer's
[SPEAKER_02]: market or go into a shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like big companies are only interested in
profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of these carts are being made just
for pure profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says it there basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of these companies are more
interested in profit than the people
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, talking about it more,
I think with other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where like forums come into thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's a place that we can discuss
these topics openly with lots of people
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe get somewhere from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So kind of an extension of that idea of
the vape pens and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel about the introduction of
non-cannabis derived terpenes to cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: or even the reintroduction?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you feel like this idea of removing and
then adding back is deleterious to the
[SPEAKER_06]: overall effect?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not something that I've really
looked into at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I don't think it's something
that we should be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think there's any need for using
non-cannabis derived terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you are, what is the reason?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just for the flavor or is it because
those terpenes have a medicinal use as
[SPEAKER_02]: well?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think a lot more research needs to be
done in this area, especially about
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going to be something for
the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they play a massive role in
healing in many other forms, the high it
[SPEAKER_02]: creates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, more testing needs to be done
definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, something which kind of opened my
eyes a little bit is that everyone always
[SPEAKER_06]: knows that terpenes play some sort of
modulatory role with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because a weed with terpenes gets you
really high.
[SPEAKER_06]: That same weed that's been in a cupboard
for months and it's lost all the terpenes,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's just not the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the presumable implication is that the
terpenes are the thing which is causing
[SPEAKER_06]: the main change.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you realize that THC itself is
actually a terpene by definition.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to me, that really linked it all
together a whole lot more.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think many people are aware of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Education on this subject and sharing all
this knowledge needs to be done on a more
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of regular basis because there's so
much to learn about this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's only the start because we're only
now being able to do the things that we
[SPEAKER_02]: want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still struggling where I am,
but still there are places that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: have things tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: But America, they're going to be able to
do so many different things now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that it's opened up how it has.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you think that with the
commercialization of things we've been
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about, that there's going to be
this increasing tendency to kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: intellectualize breeding and that the idea
of using a lab to do it will just become
[SPEAKER_06]: the common and people using first
principles to select a male is just going
[SPEAKER_06]: to go out the window?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of the maybe some of the
other companies will maybe go down this
[SPEAKER_02]: line or like I don't know if it was you on
one of your interviews was talking about a
[SPEAKER_02]: computer generated breeding program.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can see it going down those lines
and stuff, but we'll see how they do and
[SPEAKER_02]: what they make from doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's all going to be very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I don't know if they can I think
it's breeding is a little bit of art as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as science.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, with that being said about the
old ways of breeding, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: using your nose and not so much relying on
the labs, how long would you be willing to
[SPEAKER_06]: work a line before you call it quits?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just say you made Lilt and there was
something about it you weren't happy with
[SPEAKER_06]: and you're like, all right, I'll just I'll
just work it for a generation or two.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll fix that up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of doesn't come, you know,
at least not in one or two generations.
[SPEAKER_06]: At what point would you be like,
look, this has just been too much of a
[SPEAKER_06]: time sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if it's not doing what I want it to
after a couple of generations,
[SPEAKER_02]: then I'd probably scrap that line with if
it was like a certain taste, say I was
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for and I was only getting a
certain percentage, I could maybe still
[SPEAKER_02]: release it, but explain that you're only
going to get 50 percent of this type of
[SPEAKER_02]: phenome and this one and you might get
this one or maybe we used to do this on
[SPEAKER_02]: Breed Bay anyway, like we'd fill out a
little form and explain how many phenomes
[SPEAKER_02]: of this type and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe like a little bit more of that
should be done anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you feel like this plays into the
idea of why people have this tendency to
[SPEAKER_06]: release F1s?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it seems like not many people are
working lines further.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's obviously a commercial reason
for that, because it takes time and money
[SPEAKER_06]: and you're not exactly evenly compensated.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a strain that goes through several
generations of work doesn't go necessarily
[SPEAKER_06]: for like three or four times the cost of
an F1.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you think we combat that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because there seems to be like a want for
people to like, you know, the consumers
[SPEAKER_06]: want breeders to work the lines to
stabilize them more.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, if the financial
compensation isn't there, how do we
[SPEAKER_06]: encourage it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is a hard one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for me, yeah, it's time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been making a lot more F1s and
releasing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But during that, I will work some other
lines and, yeah, it takes the time to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not I don't get any more price on
the seeds, if anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: My more work lines are cheaper than my F1
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you feel like maybe the introduction
of a standardized seed pricing model would
[SPEAKER_06]: be a benefit to the community in that,
you know, everyone sells F1s for around
[SPEAKER_06]: this price, everyone sells F2s for around
this price, and it enforces like both a
[SPEAKER_06]: floor and a ceiling to the pricing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'd be interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the seed market, the pricing
is so varied at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've increased some prices like the cherry
spice, because the amount of the seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: that it produces is just like so little
compared to other things I pollinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I think that I've done it like
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've tried to work out which lines sort
of cost me more to make or have done,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've tried to do it like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it varies so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you've got other people just charging
five hundred or six hundred dollars for a
[SPEAKER_02]: packet that's just built on hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a pricing would be interesting to see
what people come up with.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's let's delve into this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get a little bit feisty.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Cookie Fam with that candy rain,
they still haven't fixed anyone up for
[SPEAKER_06]: those issues they had.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure you're well aware of this,
given the UK is pretty well in the grips
[SPEAKER_06]: of the hype market.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel about that, Sitch?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may have to explain a little bit to
me as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who made the candy rain exactly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that Jigga?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, see, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard rumours that it was Canorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least he got dragged into it when
people were asking for refunds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not too sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's all just crazy again,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all built on hype and they've totally
released something without testing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, people have been left very
disappointed, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you feel there's an onus on five
hundred dollar F1 packs to replace seeds
[SPEAKER_06]: if they don't germinate?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I think things have happened
in the past when we were online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was a ICMAG this was on,
or maybe one of the other forums.
[SPEAKER_02]: But somebody had made a line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't go into who it was and stuff like
that, but somebody made a line and they
[SPEAKER_02]: were auto flowering for some reason,
because when they were testing them,
[SPEAKER_02]: they tested them as seeds and just put
them into flour without vegging them too
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and that guy replaced people's seeds
and made the effort to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I think, yeah, you need to
stick by your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you made a mistake, try to give
something back to the people that put
[SPEAKER_02]: money in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, I feel like I've already dug
this hole so I may as well keep digging.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you ever buy some cookie farm seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I could never pay for that price.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they gave me a pack for free,
I might pop them just to see what they
[SPEAKER_02]: were like.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so how do you feel about the idea of
these crews who can't even necessarily
[SPEAKER_06]: prove the clear lineation of them creating
the seeds, having parental stock,
[SPEAKER_06]: et cetera, releasing seeds?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because from my perspective, you know,
and I'll caveat this by saying anyone from
[SPEAKER_06]: cookie family wants to come on the show,
hit me up, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: But but with that being said, you know,
there's no clear evidence to me that,
[SPEAKER_06]: like, this wasn't a mistake.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the idea that they're now releasing
seeds under the guise of like,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, well, we made this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, did you really?
[SPEAKER_06]: And the seeds you're releasing,
are they going to be any good even?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's just so I know people
personally that bought a packet and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just all built on that hype
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people get sucked into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see it with so many other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: With other products that you buy that you
it's not a superior product, but you're
[SPEAKER_02]: buying it because of the name on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to kind of get ourselves out of
this hole quickly, but equally kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: controversial.
[SPEAKER_06]: How would you react and how would you feel
if someone, you know, kind of put a post
[SPEAKER_06]: up on Instagram and it was like,
oh, I've got S1s for sale soon of
[SPEAKER_06]: Mandarin, of Lilt, of Perseng Hayes,
you know, all of these strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, how would that make you react?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like an S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that would be a little bit
too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to be totally honest, I don't even
think it'd bother me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like too much bother me nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: So but I can understand, like,
if someone's say my mandarina,
[SPEAKER_02]: someone's S1ed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they did that in Morocco,
to be honest, you know, and grew out the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and grew out the seeds and grew out
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and someone asked me the other day,
could they feminize and make an orange
[SPEAKER_02]: soda for somebody that wants the seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like, well, to be honest with
you, it's probably something that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to remake myself at some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a few people make things that I
might was thinking of sort of making and
[SPEAKER_02]: they've done the cross from seeds that
they bought and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not going to be like how I would
make it anyway, because of my selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can give someone the same
ingredients, but will they sort of cook
[SPEAKER_02]: the same meal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, yeah, so it doesn't really matter
too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I like to see that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to see people use my genetics and
maybe make something of their own from
[SPEAKER_02]: them by crossing something together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I've seen a lot of people have
been using the cherry spice.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few people have started using the lil
with some crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's nice to see them being used
and that they think they're good enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: use compared to everything else that
they've been growing, which is really
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they've grown them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I see people just crossing
stuff, wanting to cross stuff together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before they've even grown them out,
which just doesn't even make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at least they're doing some selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's weird people not doing that
selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just to link back to your other point,
our mutual buddy Organically Enhanced,
[SPEAKER_06]: he made some crosses with his cherry spice
keeper he found.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he even used some Mac pollen,
which definitely going to create an
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting cross.
[SPEAKER_06]: But perfect segue to my next question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for bringing it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Saving me a bunch of effort.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel about other companies
using your work in their crosses?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you feel overall it's a positive or
sometimes it can be detrimental?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's never really been a problem for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say now somebody uses the mandarina in the
cross and someone does grow that out and
[SPEAKER_02]: they like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they'll want to grow out the real
mandarina because you find so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different phenols in the mandarina like
that, but some better, some more sweet,
[SPEAKER_02]: some more sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think people are always going to go
to the original once they find something
[SPEAKER_02]: that they like from the crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's never really been a problem
for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it all depends if you're if
you're worried about them taking business
[SPEAKER_02]: from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's going to happen
anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are going to buy seeds from
elsewhere that taste like orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but if it's got mandarina in it or
it hasn't got mandarina in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: so yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is the end goal of Trichome Jungle
Seeds?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's a bit of a broad question,
but I mean, do you kind of plan to do like
[SPEAKER_06]: a bit of a Bode and start another seed
company for kind of alternative releases
[SPEAKER_06]: that wouldn't maybe otherwise fit under
the banner of Trichome Jungles?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it just to kind of stick to what
you've already got and you just kind of do
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever you want within that context?
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be another company working
with some other people, which will be
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe based in the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_02]: But myself, I'll do like different lines,
like the cherry spice and little part of
[SPEAKER_02]: the finest selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a few other new things coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I'll definitely make new like my
standard lines would be, I would say,
[SPEAKER_02]: mandarina, jungle kush, mantis,
things like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had a bunch of lines that were
like a feminized line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I stopped making them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I did the rosewater cookie line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stopped making them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked the rosewater cookie by itself
now, which is the which is the reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I did the finest selection line.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've dropped one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might drop a couple more.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see how the cherry spice and a
little just becoming very popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll probably will continue to make
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll look for something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just there's so many things I need to
work through and so many different flavors
[SPEAKER_02]: and things like it's just time again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a big, big space and a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, be blowing some minds with the
flavors and things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've got a random question I wanted to
ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's your favorite food?
[SPEAKER_00]: Food.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: I eat a lot of avocados.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Papayas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like here where I am, you can get lots
of papaya that's grown here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of avocados.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's absolutely amazing for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my diet is vegan based sort of diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: All plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So another little random question.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your favorite music?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope you have a soft spot for UK
grime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like there's a few UK artists that I
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: From sort of like the hip hop type scene
and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Loki.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a little bit more political and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my music is so varied, like prodigy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love prodigy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he passed away the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I'll listen to anything from Psy
Trance to Mantras and Buddhist chants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, rock music to hip hop.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how varied my music is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, dude, I'm going to have to send you a
link to the DJ mix Bodhi gave me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking great.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be well up for listening to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So get us back on topic for a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any plans to do any kind of
specific feminized releases, so like a
[SPEAKER_06]: range of F1 feminized seeds or not overly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there will be some more feminized
seeds being released at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try and make a feminized lilt
and a few other lines just so other people
[SPEAKER_02]: can try them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many people want feminized seeds and
I'd love them to be able to try this,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the lilt and the tropical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, definitely a few more feminized
lines in the works.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: And do you feel like when you feminize
things, you want to kind of reserve it for
[SPEAKER_06]: the things that really prove themselves?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or would you be willing to do like an
initial cross and release as a feminized
[SPEAKER_06]: line?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or as I said, do you feel like it's
reserved for stuff that's proven itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it all depends on how it comes out
in the testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I couldn't release the feminized
mandarina that I made.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were just producing hermaphrodites
and stuff like that, so I wasn't happy
[SPEAKER_02]: with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that was an S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if I used the two mandarinas
that I have instead of just using the one
[SPEAKER_02]: on itself, that would have worked out
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think some things just don't
work and just, yeah, other things just
don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, let me see how it works.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how would you feel if you had a
project, you really wanted to release it,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're getting some awesome results from
the seeds, but like, let's just say one in
[SPEAKER_06]: every 30 or maybe one in every 40 seeds
was like just a horrific hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that at the point where you'd be like,
nah, I got to 86 this?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you feel like it's the type of thing
where you would just kind of want to be
[SPEAKER_06]: upfront with that information and be like,
it's still worth it, but you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: just keep an eye out for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think if you're gonna get like one
hermaphrodite in 100 seeds, I don't see
[SPEAKER_02]: that as a major thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially if you're using certain things
like we'll say cherry pie, for instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it a lot with crosses of cherry pie
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I find like, it's not even like a
proper hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it'll be just like a male bit
that you pick off and you don't see any
[SPEAKER_02]: more after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's gonna be something that
you see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think things with sour diesel in it is
another thing that it will spring up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the cherry pie has been an interesting
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing like almost like Boba Kush,
like LA Afi type traits coming out from a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of these like cherry pie crosses and
stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, I mean, cherry pie is a great
example because it's one of those ones
[SPEAKER_06]: where even when people are growing it just
for the bud, people will comment,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, oh, you get a few little nanos
on the lower branches.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they're not getting enough light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe there's something else at play.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you feel like these clones are still
worthwhile breeding with or kind of that
[SPEAKER_06]: issue I mentioned is a bit problematic in
the grand scheme of things?
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be problematic in the grand scheme
of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can mess up someone's whole growl
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if people are aware that these
genetics sort of, there is that chance of
[SPEAKER_02]: them doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, some of them are just like,
what I tend to do is try and find a cherry
[SPEAKER_02]: pie cross and select from that,
which don't have the hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_02]: tendencies and then work from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do a lot of my stuff from seeds and
not the original clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll make sure that like cherry pie and
girl scout cookies is the parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from the selection, find a plant
that doesn't show any of those traits that
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't want and work from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where I would go down the line
of doing try and find the terpene that you
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without the other traits.
[SPEAKER_06]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're on to our last little quick fire
questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully we're not doubling up too
much, but maybe some things have changed
[SPEAKER_06]: since we last talked.
[SPEAKER_06]: But first off, what is the best smoke
you've had recently that comes to mind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour neo and cherry spice, which I'm
really enjoying at the moment.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you try many stuff outside of your own
or not often?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, out of some of the new stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the skittles, I've got to try all the
new like American elite stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The skittles, the gelato, runts,
a few other different ones, lemon tree,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I've got to try them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed the skittles.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a real nice flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to work that line maybe into
some of my things that I'd be quite
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure you probably copped wind of
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a few months back, just before
December, we had a big kind of kerfuffle
[SPEAKER_06]: in the industry about how the Big Al Mac
$100 eighths were selling and people
[SPEAKER_06]: weren't too happy about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you feel about that and the
emergence of this premium cannabis market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's the same in Barcelona,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think that's what skittles and
stuff like that sells for like,
[SPEAKER_02]: basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like 100 euros for three grams or
something like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fuck, even more than in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's coming from probably places like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, crazy prices, absolutely crazy
prices.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've even seen it in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go to Amsterdam and they've got it on
the menu there for like 40 euros a gram
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: And how do you feel about the culture of
import calorie?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, do you feel like it's
destructive to the local producers,
[SPEAKER_06]: so to speak?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think if something's coming at that
higher price, selling at that higher
[SPEAKER_02]: price, then maybe local growers get a
little bit better price.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's when people start coming in
and selling like really like shit extract
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's so much extract in America
now made from like just crap and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like this that's going for so cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like then that comes over to places like
Spain and that brings the prices right
[SPEAKER_02]: down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that can affect things maybe.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then just to kind of wrap up our
little hype section, what's the most
[SPEAKER_06]: overhyped strain that gets sold for lots
of money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most overhyped strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I've heard, I haven't had it myself,
so I'll give that caveat, but I've heard
[SPEAKER_06]: like Runts and Grunts and all that stuff's
like not that great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Runts itself, the one that I tried was
quite nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I suppose it's batch dependent.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Purple Punch that I tried was very
lacking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Purple Punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the Gelatos, some of them weren't
even that nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then it all depends, you know,
who's grown it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think anything that's that sort of
price is overpriced.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried some Mack.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I had another one that wasn't
that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it all depends again, who grows it or
if it's from the seed or if it's a clone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, definitely right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the 2017 Emerald Cup Capulator
gave me some Mack.
[SPEAKER_06]: Phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably standout weed of that Emerald
Cup.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then yeah, I had some grown by a good
grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: Admittedly it was outdoors, but looked
amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Organic, sun-grown, just ticked all the
boxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then when I tried it, it just wasn't
anywhere near as good at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe it comes down to like the grower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, obviously Cap's going to grow some
pretty darn good Mack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's going to play a big
role.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, then I wasn't impressed
with it, but then I've spoke to other
[SPEAKER_02]: people and they're like, nah, it's
absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it must depend.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So outside of the hype strains,
what's one of the most lackluster samples
[SPEAKER_06]: you've tried in recent memory?
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I've enjoyed in Spain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, something you haven't enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like for example, what's the worst strain
you've ever had?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worst one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So recently, I'm going to say that Purple
Punch was really lacking because I
[SPEAKER_02]: expected it to be much nicer with the
hype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of things like that have been
lacking from a lot of the like Spanish
[SPEAKER_02]: seed companies that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of my favorite ones, Desert Island
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can take three strains.
[SPEAKER_06]: With you and you've got an infinite
supply.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to worry about growing them
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So which three strains you've taken with
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Lilt, Sour Neo,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Cherry Spice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those three from mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've got something sour, something
gassy, something fruity, and I'd probably
[SPEAKER_02]: miss the Mandarina.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, poor Mandarina.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still got a spot in our hearts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because I smoked too much of it now,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd miss it after a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost a little bit of Tangy Syndrome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_06]: So final question for the interview.
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your next strain coming out that
you're most excited about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour Neo.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've mentioned it quite a few times now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really enjoying that one and looking
forward to see what comes from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Afghan crosses I've just done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now let's slide an extra question in for
good measure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that you've got your Afghan Landry
seeds, I believe last time we spoke,
[SPEAKER_06]: I asked you, you know, if you could go
anywhere, collect some Landry seeds,
[SPEAKER_06]: what would you do?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think you said Afghan.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now that you got them, what's next on
the list of stuff that you don't have that
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd love to get?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy how that happened actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: You asked that question and then we were
going to India and my mate called me and
[SPEAKER_02]: he's like, there's a guy from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's coming and he's bringing some real
Afghan seeds with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just all crazy how that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me see if I can put it out there
and get the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Iranian seeds, some Persian seeds,
Iranian Persian.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh God, yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had the pleasure of trying Australian
Bodhi's Iraqi, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: they say it's probably Persian and God
it's like a bakery.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You smoke this plant and you could be
fooled into being told that it's like just
[SPEAKER_06]: a cookie cut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds like my cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think that just about brings us to
the end of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have any shout outs or comments
you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd like to shout out everybody that
I went to India with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Land Race Legacy, Indian Land Race
Exchange, Sonic, Sonic Seeds, Himalayan
[SPEAKER_02]: Connection, Afghan Kush Black Honey.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ekati Labs, all those guys.
Yeah.
