[SPEAKER_01]: And on this one, we are joined by the man
behind Swarmy Organic Seeds, the old
[SPEAKER_01]: school genetic guru himself, Gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how are you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question we love to ask our
guests, what have you been smoking on
[SPEAKER_01]: lately?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I just had some NL5 Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along with a Foster's, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: God, that's so funny that you bring up the
Foster's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I don't know if you know this,
but like it's not really sold in
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia, but it's sold everywhere
outside of Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not a real big fan of it,
but you know, I just, there it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it, you know, putting in the
effort for the Australian chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so interesting that you mentioned
that you're smoking the NL5 Haze,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's such a sort of trending
strain at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe the effect of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it just depends on who you are,
really, because it's quite introspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't recommend it for anybody with
anxiety issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't recommend it for anybody who
has any kind of bipolar or mental
[SPEAKER_00]: disorders or anything like that,
because it can take a normal human being
[SPEAKER_00]: and turn them into a freaking nut in
seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be walking through glass,
they'll be crashing the ditch,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they'll forget to water the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the warning is still there,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't find it extremely comfortable
to smoke it, but I'll take a poll here and
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good tasking thing if you don't get
too far into it, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that for a number of years,
I certainly really couldn't go near some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the strongest sativas I enjoy nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that in part, that was
probably because I had a lot of sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: general anxiety at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But interesting nowadays, it's sort of one
of those things I gravitate to more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine having a conversation with
myself, you know, five, 10 years ago and
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you couldn't pay me to smoke NL5A's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really hit the nail on the head
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a state of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can smoke anything,
you know, around the globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing to be afraid of,
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all what society put there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, it's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So automatically, your brain's set up for
failure, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you avoid those thought processes of
oppressing nature, then you're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to do way better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can do anything in the world,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke all the highland ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke all the Africans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to give you some anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if you're skilled at what
you do, you're going to find a way to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to go out and put that to
use, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, finding a way to make it work for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly can jive with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be interested to know because I
was I was pondering this last night as I
[SPEAKER_01]: was writing some questions for our chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spoken to a few people who have sort
of touched on this idea, but never fully
[SPEAKER_01]: gone there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to ask you specifically,
do you think NL5H is one of, if not the
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimate expression of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just one of those things that
made its way into history.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a time when the DEA was really harsh on
everybody in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and how Neville introduced the
NL5s and all that to us over here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States, that really changed the
game over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what roadkill skunk was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we were buying bags in Northern
Lights where, you know, it was all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what dominated everything here was
killer green, but sidelined NL5Hs and
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that came around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because all the local growers
are growing this Puget weed, whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: hell that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been wondering this myself for the
past week or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is killer green bud the same as Kentucky
bluegrass?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just don't know because it's
possible that somebody actually did take
[SPEAKER_00]: something out of the Pacific Northwest
back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we were growing up as kids,
it was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you had.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all you bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had a really pungent indica kind
of, it reminded me of California orange
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit, you know, but it had more of
a garlic thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very well could be NL lines and
that killer green bud too.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents knew Steve Murphy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think maybe it comes from Steve
Murphy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what he gave people,
it spread around and the imports had a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with it too because the brotherhood
imports were coming up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my parents had Panama,
Colombian, tie stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember being at fifth grade and
unraveling the twine off the tie stick,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we smoked that shit and oh boy,
I thought I was in trouble for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: universe, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everyone listening to this right
now is a little bit collectively jealous
[SPEAKER_01]: of your childhood after hearing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was my parents that had a lot to
do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born into the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my dad unloaded tankers of
Mexican weed in North Hollywood in 1966 at
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 years old and got paid by my grandpa to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just been something that was in
the family for a long time, just working
[SPEAKER_00]: with the biker side of the gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brotherhood of General Love,
what people don't realize is they were
[SPEAKER_00]: bikers and surfers and they'd made a pact
to work with each other, not work against
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what they call the brotherhood
of eternal love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Often we hear Hells Angels thrown around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that it was like sort of them
and then a group of hippies and they
[SPEAKER_01]: combined together and then that made the
brotherhood?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was up in the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was specifically the banditoes faction
of the Hells Angels, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, many nights I'd wake up when I
was a kid and they just all roll out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you know, 300 strong and fire off
all their hoosies and just leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but that's who brought us the
roadkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who brought the roadkill out to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember seeing it growing when,
you know, in 1981, 82, I remember watering
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember picking buds off the plants and
taking them to school and smoking them
[SPEAKER_00]: with my friends, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I got busted with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many avenues we're going to have to
loop back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess before we get into the roadkill
skunk too much, because I would love to
[SPEAKER_01]: pick your brain on it, I just wanted to
quickly ask the KGB, the killer green bud,
[SPEAKER_01]: any speculation as to what the genetics
might have been?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an Afghani, probably a Mexican
because, you know, or Colombian,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say too, you know, because there
was a lot of Colombian imports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the herb that was coming in back
then in the late seventies was Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brown, dark, black, Colombian,
cheap, plentiful, fat sacks, good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because I'm a little out of touch
with the timeline, was this before like
[SPEAKER_01]: the commercial release of skunk one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hadn't, I never heard of skunk
one until probably 1987 or 88.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by then I was already incarcerated,
had already gone through the ringer with
[SPEAKER_00]: roadkill, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when skunk one came out and I smelled
it and I grew it and I looked at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, I thought it was a joke, you know,
because it wasn't skunk at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a plant that seemed to melt
under every condition that we put it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would melt in the frost, it would melt
in the heat, it would melt, just melt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these weren't the Pacific
Northwest genetics that we knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've never been a fan and still not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not a real skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the RKS to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it like a pure Afghani?
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably, yeah, HC says it was a
pure Afghani and I believe him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everything he told me corresponds
to the timeline that my parents were
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with this gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I trust what he's saying and I would
say he's probably right that it's a pure
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani, but it could have an import in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was growing those plants in 81,
they were thin, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were thin leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't wide fat leaves and they
would get black and green when the cold
[SPEAKER_00]: hit them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of purple in the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: More of a Christmas tree indica profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the old catalogs,
the old indicas, they looked a lot like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably a Hindu.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we've heard from other
people who have come on the show is
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously they're not stating it with
certainty, but they've said there might
[SPEAKER_01]: have been a few things that had that aroma
and not just one specific clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you sit on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown just about everything from
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just one or two at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of that skunk pop up in a
lot of different things, but what I see it
[SPEAKER_00]: pop up in most is unmolested Hindu type
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher altitude Afghani Pakistan Hindu
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: People often say that the reason why
Roadkill disappeared was because people
[SPEAKER_01]: were getting busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that your thoughts on why we saw it
vanish?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably at least 70 to 80% of the
reason, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was so loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so stinky, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were just done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not getting away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to track you down through
scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was quite difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I can only imagine pre-carbon
filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The anxiety level must have been through
the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got cracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did two weeks in juvie for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did know growers that were getting
cracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be driving down the street and smell
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just knew that house right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Duh.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen a huge, over the past probably
three, four years now, this huge
[SPEAKER_01]: resurgence in people looking for the
Roadkill skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's the type of thing where
we will ever find it again?
[SPEAKER_01]: If we do, would you think we should try to
breed it from scratch again or go back on
[SPEAKER_01]: old seeds and try to hunt it through that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've done both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a five-year RKS project going now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just about done with it actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at a lot of stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through a lot of things,
a lot of old land races, a lot of old
[SPEAKER_00]: types.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just boiled back down to the original
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I had to out-cross to get it
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using an 85 Humboldt Roadkill that was
taken to Mexico in 1985.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude stopped by Humboldt, bought a bag,
went straight to Mexico, gave it to his
[SPEAKER_00]: sister.
[SPEAKER_00]: She smoked the weed, took the seeds out of
it, gave it to her local farmer who's
[SPEAKER_00]: doing exports.
[SPEAKER_00]: He crossed it to that type, which was a
European type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good region for growing good herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's noted for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds were sent back in 2017 and I
only got two males.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I'd just out-cross them to my
oldest types in the hopes that I could
[SPEAKER_00]: grab that genotype in there somehow by
waking it up with these old types.
[SPEAKER_00]: With Mr. Green Jeans Cherry Bomb,
with Coot's Blue Orca, and with this
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple Zeep, which had Blue Mystic in it
and the Purple Roadkill skunk in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was pretty good, but that was
more of a poly from Nirvana than just an
[SPEAKER_00]: old unmolested type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked, but I had to go through a lot
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did F2 of the Blue Orca by the 85
Roadkill Yuruapan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just searched through massively of those
and we found what we were looking for with
[SPEAKER_00]: going, yep, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what it smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hope that if we cross it back to one
of these 63 breeder packs that HC gave me,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can wake up that genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all we got, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, unless you're going to go out
there in the world and go search for
[SPEAKER_00]: unmolested types for that skunk phenotype
and then bring those types back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States and sit there and work and
work them and work them and work them
[SPEAKER_00]: together, nobody's ever going to find that
unless they don't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's interesting because that sounds
like it could well be a nice recipe for
[SPEAKER_01]: success.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard other people use alternative
routes and looking through what they
[SPEAKER_01]: consider to maybe be really early skunk
releases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'd be interested in hearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people say that at a certain
point pretty early on in the grand scheme
[SPEAKER_01]: of things, Sam bred it from stinky to
sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there ever was a stinky
skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they say, but I think Sam's
bullshit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that guy's just shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything he said, he tried to sell out
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a known liar.
[SPEAKER_00]: All his stories don't match anybody else's
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that were here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that were there and
everything he says seemed to contradict
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: David's Watson, is a douche, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, I don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's bullshit because I've seen a
lot of types, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what a Colombian does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what ties do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked almost every damn tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To confirm, do you think it always was
sweet?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was never this RKS prior to the
sweet skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: It had nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing to do with it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he got ahold of it and bred that out of
it, he had nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I still see where you're coming
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if he did make the sweet from the
rotten, it's by itself saying he didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: make the rotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just another claim to fame.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want to just jump on a bandwagon
and be the one and the only to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: one and the only, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either you have it or you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pig with lipstick or it's the real
thing, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be interested to hear your thoughts
on... You just touched on Sam and
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned you're not a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear your thoughts on Neville
because he's someone who more recently
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been hearing thoughts about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I respect Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I respect Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah, because he was actually a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bred dogs before he bred cannabis,
so that gives him authenticity.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not some dude that just woke up one
day, dude, I'm going to be a breeder and
[SPEAKER_00]: open a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cat had an idea and Cat did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not the father of modern breeding for
no reason at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he knew what he was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say Neville had the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: When they say he's got the eye,
if you got the eye, you got the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smiling compared to the ones over
here that are frowning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know when you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Neville had the eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was really good at making selections
like I am or like a lot of other breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: are too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see the hybrid potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see the vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he knew what he was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, he took it to the top,
didn't he?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I certainly regard him like
yourself as the father of modern breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'd be interested to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some guests in the past have mentioned
that through having known him more closely
[SPEAKER_01]: on a personal level or maybe friends of
that, he might be one of those people
[SPEAKER_01]: where you need to do a little bit of
separating of the art and the artist,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever heard anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, he's a great breeder,
but maybe there was some character flaws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any thoughts on that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I talk to his best friend every day,
you know, and he's online now because he
[SPEAKER_00]: just resurfaced out of the woodwork from
being, you know, these guys were
[SPEAKER_00]: persecuted internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were sought after for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people just get tired of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get tired of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get tired of hiding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get tired of seeing all this
bullshit, and they want to pop out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: woodwork and say, hey, no, that didn't
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before Neville died, he told Dwight,
find me because I'm doing what he was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing what Neville was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm focusing on breeding, not magazine
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my head isn't in magazine
culture and capitalism and trying to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the next big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My head's in breeding and the fascination
that lies in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so anyway, when I posted my back
cross of the Neville, NL5 by the 88,
[SPEAKER_00]: NL5 Hayes, Neville saw it and he's like,
ooh, that's it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before he died, he pointed Dwight in
my direction and we got in contact with
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been communicating each other
and sharing projects and doing things with
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville's last works, you know,
like the Outback Hayes and Neville's Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple other things, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would I be able to pull you up for a quick
second and ask you about some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I had seen the Outback Hayes
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never heard of Neville's Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's the thing about the Neville's
Kush is we don't know what the lineage is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because Neville was really sick at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he didn't want to bug him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hey, man, what's this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Neville wanted to Kush because that's
what everybody was doing in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said, hey, I want to make one,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, Dwight has those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, he's he's in with the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Neville family is is is is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't talk about it too much,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just say that things are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just just for clarification, say,
are we talking about like his extended
[SPEAKER_01]: friends or like his literal family are
sort of doing stuff with his literal
[SPEAKER_00]: family, family and friends?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a son, you know, and he's
interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that just out of, like,
you know, being Australian, I tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of track him down many, many years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had always hoped that some news like
this would sort of come out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: woodworks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's a lot going on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't talk about it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my position.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you interviewed Dwight,
he might he might talk about some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't I can't overstep my boundaries and
just, you know, give that information out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know, it's it's it's alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to loop back before we move on
the outback haze, I think it's one that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are still sort of learning about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not super well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you able to tell us anything at all
about that in terms of maybe the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: or what it's similar to, at least?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it says it's 2133 and and
Hampy's tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whatever tie that was,
we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you look at Thailand and you look at
the types in Thailand and for thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: years, it was the squirrel tail type,
you know, that was held by kings and
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed throughout the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regions by the people that held that type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's the Isan province type,
the tie stick, those types.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were other types, of course,
that were, you know, like the red tie,
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue tie, the blah, blah, blah,
blah tie, the chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these were developed for export.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not not the red, but the
chocolate and the and the tie stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all that was all export.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were export crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were based off of the squirrel
tail variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like three or four or five
different phenotypes of this squirrel tail
[SPEAKER_00]: tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's probably what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's a squirrel tail variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Neville liked it, you know,
so he used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he put it in there and there's probably
a tie in the haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it mashes up great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm feeling a bit out of my depth
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said I think you said 21 cross 33.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, what were those?
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was his haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the numbered cutting photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look, I can find photographs of
them and they look nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're like, wow, that's a nice
looking haze, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, I thought when you said
the 21, I was like, is he talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: Marlon Madness?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think there's a famous 21
cutting of Marlon or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I grew those at flowering time was
too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what Neville said sent Dwight his
branch of the outback.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also gave it to other people,
connoisseur, you know, and a couple other
[SPEAKER_00]: guys, but they have different lines or
different branches of the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each one of these guys that have a
different branch of this outback work have
[SPEAKER_00]: different, you know, they've put their own
selections on it in their own IBL,
[SPEAKER_00]: Elling of it and have made it what it is
in their own selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dwight's is different than connoisseurs
and it's different than whatever whoever
[SPEAKER_00]: else has it in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so the phenotypic
variations are going to vary depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what breeder gets it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've already, you know, like,
like how I got ahold of the NL2,
[SPEAKER_00]: the R2, you know, my selections are
different than Dwight's selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right there, our line goes in two
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so if I keep going down my path,
mine's going to be totally different than
[SPEAKER_00]: his in three or four generations,
even though it's a 30-year IBL.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how would you describe your NL2?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been lucky enough to try Bodhi's
Thinleaf NL2, but I've never tried the
[SPEAKER_01]: more indica-leaning phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on the line in
general?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the, I got this line from Dwight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the R2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's popular up in Northern Ontario.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 30-year IBL of the NL2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That they did outdoors, they had privacy
and they had a lot of space and they had a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of room to do a lot of selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really did a good job on selecting
for phenotypes that finished early with a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice cush profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're fast and they're
resinous and they withstand the cold
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty great.
[SPEAKER_00]: R2 means Ron had two seeds, whoever Ron
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's rumour that there's Skunk One
in it, but we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it looks like NL2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It behaves like an NL2, you know,
cushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's what NL2 is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's NL1 by Neville's Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, and do you see any real sativa in
there at all or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just enough to make it interesting,
you know, how most Afghan dominant types
[SPEAKER_00]: are with that one sativa in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that was largely the sentiment
that Bodhi echoed when I was talking to
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, oh, you know, this was just
one plant out of God knows how many that
[SPEAKER_01]: had a little bit of a thinner leaf and
just melted your face the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was lovely stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked the hell out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of a good Williams Wonder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nice rounded, nice warm,
huggy kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I love that you just said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Williams Wonder is one of my super
nostalgic strains I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not enough people have had experience
with it, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a good one, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and huggy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was the first weed I ever tried
where I was like, oh, this is kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: mango-y passion fruit, like getting
towards that passion fruit side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least the sample I tried was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Ruderalis in it that gives it
that unique kind of astringent,
[SPEAKER_00]: bitter thing that it has, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of the sweet that the Afghani has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you know anything about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I think there's some rumors that it
was created in Oregon somewhere between
[SPEAKER_01]: Williams and Wonder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've always wondered, do you think
there's any truth to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to think that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what that was the rumor,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was bred by some guy in Indiana and
his name wasn't even William.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think like that was the case for a
lot of the SSSC crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when those guys sourced that
stuff back then, they were getting what
[SPEAKER_00]: they could get.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, oh, this is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Oregon Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Kandahar, probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, it was mostly imports or
what heads had gone and collected from
[SPEAKER_00]: their travels abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I want to know is who sent Mel Frank
the nine seeds of Afghani number one from
[SPEAKER_00]: Kabul, Afghanistan in 1979.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that Watson?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who did that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's actually a really good
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I always ask people who are a bit
older, like, do you remember distinctly
[SPEAKER_01]: the first time you saw Afghans rolling
into California, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the brotherhood brought them in,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought them in in 69.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were going to Afghanistan and getting
the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii was loaded with hash that the
brotherhood brought there, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all Kandahar, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the Kandahars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you may not have a definitive
answer to this, but do you have any
[SPEAKER_01]: guesses as to what Steve Murphy's Purus
Indica might have been?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mazar or just one of those region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's rumored to be a mazar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a mazar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could be a Kabul.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anything within that region,
a Balk, anything, a Shebergen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had little knowledge of these
things back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just knew Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was only the brotherhood and
people that kept record of this stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: came back and said, yeah, we got this from
Kandahar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think a lot of people looking
at the Purus Indica would be quite
[SPEAKER_01]: impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very pretty looking plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of ways, it sort of reminds me of
deep chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like it's one of the better
expressions of Afghani or like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a lot that's better?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just less known.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the Western world's used to one thing,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the combination of a mazar and
a Hindu in one package.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's simply because of the introduction of
the Northern Lights combination of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hindu and the mazar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people, this Americanized thought
process, they love that outboard exhaust
[SPEAKER_00]: smell on Labor Day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That greasy, sweet, tiny, you know,
they're just used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what all through the 80s is what
American's palette was used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we bred with these types,
into the early 90s, that's what everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: got.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what everything is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all mazar Hindu effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you really go to the specific
regions and get those specific Afghanis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to know what this is all
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of these hash plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these families kept these things
for hundreds of years in their family or
[SPEAKER_00]: their tribe or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a unique special product
that's like unique and special and like
[SPEAKER_00]: food grade, super valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was only war and stuff like that
that started disrupting that heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, I've grown a lot of
Afghanistan's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've probably grown maybe 10 different
land race Afghanis and we're talking,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, up to 40 plants every run
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking at the traits of all these
Afghanis and none of them have that modern
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor perfect cola thing going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of them have a higher kind of
resin quality, a higher terpene value,
[SPEAKER_00]: a higher, you know, you're really your
eyes really light up when you when you put
[SPEAKER_00]: your senses on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like the ball cache,
for example, that's like one of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: patches in the world, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smiley, giddy, happy, just boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like if all herb could smoke
like that, everybody would be happy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've you got me thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I might have some bulk seeds
stashed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I need to get on to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it would be really cool to do an
indoor run of something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, maybe hybridize it to a
modern type and see what you can what you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a popular thing now, you know,
and I don't know if I'm the cause of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that was that's what I started
doing so long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another guy started doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another guy started doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back then, it was me,
Snow High, Bodi, just a couple of guys
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, now we got 500 seed, 999 seed banks,
and they're all like, ah, trying to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: next big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just touched on a question I wanted to
bring up, which was sort of ties into both
[SPEAKER_01]: when you were talking about Neville and he
had the eye, as well as what you just
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned about the types of crosses you
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed both in Neville's work and with
your own that possibly, from my
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, one of the sort of key
components that seems to have a good
[SPEAKER_01]: chance of success is doing those raw F1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you mentioned earlier that
hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you really can't replicate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that's one of the keys?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a method to my madness,
and it's not magazine breeding culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an agricultural background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to college for this stuff,
you know, before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was to listen to the advice of Ask Ed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I'm talking about, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I popped out of college,
I had an education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an agricultural background when I
first started growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, on my own as an adult out of
school and.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I approached it at on that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I cloned the way I did everything
was different than this magazine paradigm,
[SPEAKER_00]: which seemed to be geared towards product
sales and selling mark gimmicky this and
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way they taught us to do this in
aggregate and in the agriculture sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was so much more simpler and basic and
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really the magazine, the myths.
[SPEAKER_00]: That turned turned me off about all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's just bullshit, you know,
you don't need none of that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look, it's interesting that you
bring that up because I did want to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about that and I thought I've been having
more recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's pretty edgy, a bit
controversial is that I'm starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: think maybe high times was like equally as
damaging for the scene as it was
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true, but you know, it's like don't
shoot the messenger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave us a lot during the 70s,
they gave us a lot during the 80s,
[SPEAKER_00]: but somewhere in the like 90s it started
to fall off into into glossy marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: gimmicky shit, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 70s, they were they were thick,
fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Informative magazines, you know,
I remember sitting around reading these
[SPEAKER_00]: things as a kid with my my parents would
buy them, you know, so they're always
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read every damn high times I ever
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've watched the magazine
deteriorate into what it is today is what
[SPEAKER_00]: you might say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did in a way lead to a lot of
misinformation and targeting a lot of 18
[SPEAKER_00]: to 25 year old males to buy just junk,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that junk comment you make really
hammers home because I think at a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: point you see that, you know, pay for play
advertising and awards and articles start
[SPEAKER_01]: to creep into the magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a long time, I thought,
you know, whoever was the editor in chief
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of dropped the ball a bit by,
you know, we're going to do a big strain
[SPEAKER_01]: write up about this company's blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's just some random paid
advertisement.
[SPEAKER_00]: More or less, you start seeing what it is,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you start seeing it for what it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see right through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I thought it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought even more funny was that,
you know, a few years ago, High Times sold
[SPEAKER_01]: and like Danny Danko and all those people
working for it moved on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they've started a new magazine and
everyone was like sort of keen to support
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, hang on, wasn't Danny
Danko the editor in chief who allowed all
[SPEAKER_01]: this sort of faux advertising to occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny you say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Donnie Danko did a Living Organic Soil
article and basically plagiarized all of
[SPEAKER_00]: our information and didn't give us any
credit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because we're the ones where I
am the proprietor of Living Organic Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just dropped the soil thing in favor of
the seed thing, because that really wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can teach a man to fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: He fishes for the rest of his life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't making any money off that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't sustain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we taught a man to fish a thousand
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: For free.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the information is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go and get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need nothing, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The secret to all of this is increasing
your negative ionic surface area in your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think that's why without people
understanding exactly what you're saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: they sort of have this propensity to want
to increase your cationic exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as Americans and capitalists and
marketing victims, they want instant
[SPEAKER_00]: gratification because they're Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to spray the bug and the bug
needs to die now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they apply these fertilizers,
they want to see magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see, oh, just like in the
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I put more on, it'll get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: More, more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant craves electrolytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a big scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a lot of money to be
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Millions of dollars, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now Monsanto has their hands in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They own General Hydroponics, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Miracle Grove, blah, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to take their dirty
fucking hands out of that scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to, they're going to keep
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to keep pushing their
fucking poison on us, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like I said, my information
is free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get online and you'll find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the soil recipes, all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell you how to do everything for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's trippy about it all is the seed
company idea, because anybody can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody is doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it creates a lot of confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates a lot of, you know,
I don't even know what this stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally disregard it and excuse it as
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wedding cake, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't even bought weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a dispensary, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I smoke black Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Panama's and just come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I don't need to ask you what
your favorite Girl Scout cutting is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, so let's tap into that then,
because I'd love to ask you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: out of those cool, funky, you know,
black Colombian, cool stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a variety that you think isn't
particularly well known, but everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: would like love the shit out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, anybody that smokes a black
Colombian would just love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a Jamaican or a nice African or a good
Thai, you know, one or two pulls off this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all you need, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're so see you go, go do a task,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love to touch on the Colombian a
little more, because I think as time's
[SPEAKER_01]: gone by, I've started to realize that when
I first got into genetics, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: I maybe put a bit of overemphasis on Thai
and especially with the reemergence of
[SPEAKER_01]: like the the black Colombian haze,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm starting to learn more from
people that like Colombian might be the
[SPEAKER_01]: unsung hero in a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're right, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's it's it's overlooked a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite has a nice effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's your eyes, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're baked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's there's CBD in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're you're on the couch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think, oh, I'm going to smoke this
Colombian sativa and I'm going to just get
[SPEAKER_00]: all this energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really work that way,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I had a I smoked some black
Colombian with a friend of mine who grows
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of Polly's wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's cookies that and all this one hit
dude was on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hit of some ropey ass looking black
Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: That says it all, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you feel like, you know,
a lot of the consumers out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, who might say, oh,
you know, cookies is all that really does
[SPEAKER_01]: it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think like they just don't have the
exposure to really make that claim?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just they're just lost in that
world of capitalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they don't maybe they're
not thinking enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're just complacent in their
lives with their device and their
[SPEAKER_00]: programming and everything that they do in
their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I mean, look at somebody
like me who's passionate about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything and has done it his whole
life compared to somebody who just wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke a smoke or whatever, get stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does he care about cookies or
whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Younger, younger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look, I think it's actually probably
one of the more pertinent questions that's
[SPEAKER_01]: been in my mind for a while now,
which sort of if I gist it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like is the onus on us as the growers
and breeders to try to edge educate the
[SPEAKER_01]: general consumer or like like how do we
let people know that like cookies is not
[SPEAKER_01]: the ultimate expression of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I kind of do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I kind of that's my there's a
method to my madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's introducing different types of
cannabis to people from around the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, in different combinations and going
back to what you were saying about hetero
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a method to my madness with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't I guess I'm going to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with heterosis breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm following the heterosis pattern
that when I take parents of unrelated
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic origin and I cross them together,
I'm going most likely going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: heterosis hybrid child.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be parents, there's going
to be kids that look like their mom,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be kids that look like
their dad, and there's going to be kids
[SPEAKER_00]: that have hybrid vigor because these are
unrelated genetic parents that push
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody out of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their flowers are bigger, there's more
resin, they're faster, they're they're
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what I focus on is
because I want people to experience the
[SPEAKER_00]: heterosis value of the F1 and they get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, they see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, they're getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, dude buys a pack of seeds,
cracks them open, finds this plant goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, over and over again,
it doesn't matter what happens online
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's all bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dude's life just changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he told me in an email and it's
year after year, man, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, you just made me think
back myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: When was the last time I grew a true F1
hybrid?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it's probably a while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I thought, you're right,
there's probably a lot of people out there
[SPEAKER_01]: who have never grown a true F1 and they do
have that sort of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like revelation moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what it is, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chance exists that you're not
going to find that heterosis vigor in some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these these outcrossings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is it works 95% of the
time, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of a pack of 15 seeds, cats going
to get five individuals exhibit heterosis
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sit like with a bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a bulk by a cyanide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're monsters, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just just colas of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our branches of hash,
you know, and that's what those plants
[SPEAKER_00]: were traditionally bred for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were hash plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were bred to produce resin,
not take centerfold pictures in high
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cyanide, it's not a strain you hear about
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have heard about it before and I
thought, oh, Egyptian, that sounds sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything unique about that one from your
perspective that maybe differentiates it a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just the fact that it's an ancient
type and it was developed as a hash plant
[SPEAKER_00]: for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's potent, you know, it has flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's you could tell it was selected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was something that was kept
by these people for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty neat, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to be you got to be a gland
race guy to appreciate this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be like, wow, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm going to I want to grow a bunch
of cyanides and like put fill a jar of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got to be one of those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so if anyone was listening and they're
like, look, I'm keen to give it a go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to try a cool F1, maybe find some
of this hybrid vigor you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's something you offer that you think
you'd be happy to sort of say,
[SPEAKER_01]: look, start with this, you probably find
something good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of the things I always point
to people to is a Masar Sharif by the 76
[SPEAKER_00]: piece Gorgiero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've worked that line into the into an
IVL over the last 10 years using siblings
[SPEAKER_00]: and back crosses and blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah to get what I want out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As as a line, it's got a good meditative
quality to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it's better than an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better than cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're you know, this is weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't smoke for like two, three days
in a row because you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: hangover effect for two, three days in a
row.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, wow, that's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can look at the numbers on my
page and you can see the CBG in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's very odd that these
these these terp profiles are so different
[SPEAKER_00]: from all these modern Polly's,
you know, because they are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Period.
[SPEAKER_00]: These these all these modern Polly's have
the same genetics unless these guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: out crossing them to these land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: Masar Hindu, Masar Hindu, Masar Hindu,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of curiosity, because it is like a bit
of a focal point in discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, because I think some people think it's
just pure NL5 haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you suspect some skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude bought a pack of seeds from the
catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He moved to Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skunk got mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he used it on his NL haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are there any specific skunk traits
you see in the Cuban black haze?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the orange hairs, you know,
the nose bite that SK1 has, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those traits that SK1 has that are
identifiable in most of its outcrosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but it's definitely NL5 haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned before the Peace Corps
Guerrero, we had a listener who is a fan
[SPEAKER_01]: of yours ask if you could maybe talk a
little bit about the Peace Corps Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, here's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew a guy one time who knew a lady who
during the 70s, all throughout the 70s,
[SPEAKER_00]: worked in South America and Mexico as a
Peace Corps worker.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was heady.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was from California and she was a
stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she collected seeds from the weeds she
bought in every freaking region she went
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got the package, there were over 30
types and stuff I couldn't even pronounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they were all stored,
they're all stored improperly,
[SPEAKER_00]: rolled up in little bindles and put in a
film container, you know, kept in a box
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only thing that we got up was the
Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Guerrero and the Acuna.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now the Acuna was given to another
grower and he got robbed and we lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: We reproduced it, we reproduced the
Guerrero and we distributed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snow High got some of my Panama and he
calls it the 76.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we don't know what the years were on
the Panama, so I say 74 through 76.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says 76, I say 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they all came through my hands first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you feel like they're quite unique
compared to maybe some of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: Panamas we see, like from maybe ace seeds
or coastal genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, they're pure, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just pure Panama.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no molestation about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a pure Panama red line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything that it ever was,
it started them under 1212 in seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big long red spears, lots of lots of
hairs, you know, one or two hits and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're blah, blah, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I'd be interested in asking
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people think that the reason why Haze
is so good was because collectively it was
[SPEAKER_01]: better than the individual parts,
but it sounds like you're really fond of
[SPEAKER_01]: each of the individual parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that Haze was much of an
improvement on each of the components?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the thing is, is nobody really knows
what Haze is.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we can only guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what the top guys think, me,
Dwight and these other guys, we're tracing
[SPEAKER_00]: lineage and we're tracing history or we're
tracing roots of import and all this other
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was most likely brotherhood imports.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, whatever those guys brought in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, here's a here's a hint.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1966, there was a movie called Oh,
what was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a surfer movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Henson and the other dude that go
around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called Endless Summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that was a Brotherhood of Eternal Love
sponsored movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually a hash and seed scouting
mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, they used the movie as cover to go and
do this in 1966.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they set up all these relations seed,
hash and everything in 66.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where it helped Mike Henson
got all these seeds and hash back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He started making the old surfboards
because you could carry a surfboard on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plane and you could carry epoxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could fill these compartments with
massive seed, massive hash and just get
[SPEAKER_00]: right on the plane, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so by 1971, they told me,
OK, by 1971, all the genetics in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: that they knew of were in the good of
beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think like there's this
treasure trove of genetics sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere waiting to be cracked open or it
all got dispersed?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's brotherhood guys I know that won't
come off their shit, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and like I could have had a chance,
but not anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are never going to come off
their shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to die with it or they're
going to give it away when they're when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's how I got the one and the
blue orca off Coot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were on good terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole freaking time, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just one day I'd show up at his house and
you don't even know who the fuck I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude had a heart attack, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Forgot everybody and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got addicted to fucking opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forgot who the fuck I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forgot he even gave me the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, you know, just forgot us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forgot that we had, you know, we'd come
there with our kids and sit on his couch
[SPEAKER_00]: and eat dinner and all this other fucking
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, it was it was kind of
disheartening, you know, but I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where a guy has a heart attack and he
forgets his own fucking kid, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever, whatever all this shit that
Coot said, it's just crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we never really said anything
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he only said one thing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, well, you've got the genetics
now, so you're set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, yeah, I know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says, but we got to do something for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to, you know, he says, just just
make a donation in my kid's name.
[SPEAKER_00]: His kid got run over by a drunk drunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driver in the early 70s and he went out
and beat the shit out of the guy and went
[SPEAKER_00]: to prison for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd made a donation in his kid's name and
we still got all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, food bank or whatever that we're
doing for for for what he gave us,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because I've always been fair
and none of steel shit for people or none
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This game's pretty cutthroat and dirty,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some scallywags out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's good you brought that up
because we did have a viewer submit a
[SPEAKER_01]: question about that, and I guess you sort
of answered some of it, but they were sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of wondering, is there an alternative
cutting of like the one, like a sort of a
[SPEAKER_01]: fake one, or is it just the one real one
and that's the one you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that Coot didn't trust and people
that I didn't trust, who we thought that
[SPEAKER_00]: were going to fuck us, that were going to
go out and just automatically start a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't give them the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave them the one by Blue Moon Rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back Cross 2 or Back Cross 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they looked almost the same,
you know, and sure as shit, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: those guys take off and boom, that's what
they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can illegitimize you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you think that you're going
to like just blow smoke up somebody's ass
[SPEAKER_00]: to come steal a cut and you're not going
to get found out in the process,
[SPEAKER_00]: come on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there's people that I've worked
with that have stolen the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Orca from me, have stolen the one
from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the one and there is the Blue
Orca out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you who or where or whatever,
but it's floating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're hard to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cuts are hard to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I like them so much is
because they're authentic old brotherhood
[SPEAKER_00]: tie and an Afghani combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Afghanis and ties, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to ask you because it's
actually really hard to find this sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the one, what are like the
turps like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, it's just it's just really
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all these these cake cookie
growers, man, once they get a hold of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, they're like, fuck that,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all I want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all I want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the truth, because that's all you
have in your jar that fucking works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, after you smoked everything in
the universe, there's the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sitting there in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's one of those ones you're
like, it'll wreck your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you don't just jump into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Bluerke, on the other hand,
that's that's like a Williams wonder or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something women can smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to, you know, it's going to
make you feel warm and huggy and smiley
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a good appetite and sleep well,
you know, because Bluerke finishes at
[SPEAKER_00]: fifty, six days and the one finishes at
80.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody out there thinks that they
have the one, better check that at 80
[SPEAKER_00]: days, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that's interesting to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of our listeners specifically was
interested in picking up a cross from you
[SPEAKER_01]: of the one to something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, which cross would you
recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: And which of the crosses do you think like
you're best going to get like a dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: the one sort of expression?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll tell you what I'm doing now is
I'm trying to put that package into seed
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done all these various I did an
out crossing to the black candahar to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the one and the Bluerke together in one
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been working those lines and
working for the trades to get into a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: line that that represents everything that
I expect out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not going to work,
I'm not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty far into it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that might be done pretty
soon, maybe this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as like what somebody can buy,
it's the one by Blue Moon Rocks,
[SPEAKER_00]: the back across two, three, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cubed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I had seen that one online and I
wanted to ask you, was there anything
[SPEAKER_01]: specific about the Blue Moon Rocks that
you thought made it like a well-suited
[SPEAKER_01]: partner to the one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I was growing herb in the 90s,
I went to Canada and I bought bubble berry
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble gum and shishkeberry off Mark Emery
in like 1993 or some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were $200 a pack, dude,
for 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew them all, you know,
and I found a nice bubble gum and I found
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice bubble berry and it wasn't really
the shishkeberry didn't do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kept that one cut of that bubble
berry and, you know, made a million
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars, you know, because it was the best
thing anybody had ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the original DJ Blueberry by the
Indiana bubble gum, you know, Sager
[SPEAKER_00]: Malthus bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a DJ Sager Malthus collaboration
and they made the bubble berry and won the
[SPEAKER_00]: cups or whatever with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're like, yeah, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I got cracked, thrown to
prison, all that other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got out of prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I want to do is go find
bubble berry again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we have OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go to Humble, buddy's down there and
they hook me up with these, these cuts and
[SPEAKER_00]: I break them back up to the back up to
Olympian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what people want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big spindly, tall, falling all over
themselves, mold and tiny little popcorn
[SPEAKER_00]: buds, but they smell good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, get your stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started looking for bubble
berries, started looking and looking,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I found out that Bogg had crossed
an old DJ blueberry to Blue Moon and then
[SPEAKER_00]: to his boggle bubble gum, which is a good
bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as I thought, ooh, ooh,
this is going to be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I got him and bought the
pack and yeah, there was some good
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes in there, but there's also some
fucking hay, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, same, same thing with
everything, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think, oh, man, I got this and did
through a nanner, you know, in my from my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, all this intersex shit comes
from poor Brady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my predecessors, not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their fucking lines that they fucked
up on, you know, because I won't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't use that shit, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess an interesting sort of
counterpoint maybe just to be devil's
[SPEAKER_01]: advocate slightly is I can't remember who
it was, but someone who deals with a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of land race work, it might've even been
Lewis from ACED said that if you do truly
[SPEAKER_01]: want to work with the land race line,
there is a bunch of Hermes stuff you got
[SPEAKER_01]: to weed through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree that there is some land
races that do have sort of Hermes and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not all horrible breeding per se?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Laos, for example, absolutely
riddled with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cashmere absolutely riddled with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that, you know, that are off
in these really weird regions of the globe
[SPEAKER_00]: that they don't really give a shit about
intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they use it as hash plants,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go up, you get, you start
pulling this stuff out of the woodwork and
[SPEAKER_00]: think that you're going to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better think again, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better, you better look at it real
good, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, there's a lot of land
races and a lot of narrow leaf drug
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking as far north into
Kazakhstan, 50 degrees north that have no
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex debt that are just nice plants,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it also is a reflection of the
thousands of years of caretaking and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to jump to another question that
a listener had submitted that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be able to answer for them is they
said, oh, you know, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sort of limited to growing in a tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any offerings that you think
would do well in a tent or just a small
[SPEAKER_01]: space in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would do like, you know,
if somebody came to me and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, this is what I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would give them what they need,
you know, like a blue arc across or
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I know stays squat and
compact and that they can manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The short flowering time, you know,
what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, where myself is like,
I'll grow anything, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: No roof limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't grow inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't grow inside anymore, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all in greenhouses, light up,
you know, because I can control the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering and height and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can see the full range of
expressions and do whatever, what I need
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that commercially produced
cannabis, like, you know, for the masses,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak, will eventually transition to
being sort of all greenhouse slash
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry is really a mystery to me
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems that marketing's over the
top, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD toothpicks, CBD socks, you know,
CBD cars for your tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, cars, tires for your car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just a joke, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to spill over into the
legitimacy of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all this gimmicky shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to climax.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to boil over and then it's
going to settle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever the settling is when it goes
federally legal, that's going to be that's
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what I'm waiting for,
too, because that puts legitimacy,
[SPEAKER_00]: that puts legitimacy to what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can now go and patent my types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody can patent a type.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't believe anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only Monsanto can.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wild west.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not until it's federal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking, you're going to be
shelling out, you know, a thousand,
[SPEAKER_00]: two thousand bucks for this patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to be waiting six months,
seven months, twelve months for an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to come back as a,
oh, what's the word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a patent, but in the process of being
a patent for the next five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so you got five guys trying to
patent the same type and you're hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: that, oh, am I going to be the one to do
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I don't patent my types,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up for grabs, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody's type is up for grabs
until the patent is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I could go steal cookies if I
wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's no patent on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll that'll be an interesting day for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to it's going to level
the playing field, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to really get rid of the
noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be curious to know what strain,
like in your opinion, most emulates a
[SPEAKER_01]: coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be South Americans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, here's a here's something that
well, I guess the Western world doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know much about is that the indigenous
people tend to select for their culinary
[SPEAKER_00]: trades.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of South American types echo
their culinary, their culinary,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, spicy, cilantro, chocolate,
coffee, all that stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to Africa, what happens there?
[SPEAKER_00]: They start it's starts imitating their
color, what they eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's one thing I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to give it a go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice Mexican or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, yeah, man, a Mexican or
Colombian or even a Oaxacan would give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice, probably a good coffee,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I might say that Oaxacan is
probably my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's just man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's really neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it one of those ones where like it's a
nice balance of different sort of things
[SPEAKER_01]: or?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's a it's a feel well type,
you know, it's a well-being type where you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it and you just shit's OK,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just something you can work
on, something you can play on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something something you can do anything on
and not be too out of your mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, say, a Vietnam would do to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking of Hayes origins,
we suspect it's Vietnam making the noise
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'll say it, there's nothing
stronger than a good Vietnam, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just, you know, I'm glad to hear
you say that, because I I think that one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the most memorable equatorial land
races I've ever had, I've had some really
[SPEAKER_01]: nice ties through Bodhi, but he let me try
one of his Vietnamese one time and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: forever held the spot in my mind is like
most memorable sort of weed I ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's very Hayes like, you know,
and these properties that Hayes has,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're reminiscent if you're a
smoker of all these land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these things that I identify and these
other guys identify Vietnam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian, Oaxacan, Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are these are there's notes in
there, you know, it's like when you when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're playing in a band, you know what
that note is, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're playing a G, man, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you can you can you can you can
tear it apart with your mind, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, get a hold of these get a just
watch what happens next, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dwight and me, we're we're we're working
on this Vietnam Hayes trip thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to see that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I got some good Vietnam crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did cross that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vietnamese provincial park land race to
the Black Colombian, and that's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty Hayes like, man, you know,
if you're Hayes, guy, that'd probably be
[SPEAKER_00]: one to get and check out and go through a
pack of those, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might need to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What sort of flower times you think might
sort of be in the ballpark?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're long, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the Black Colombian isn't as long as
people would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking, you know, 70 days,
but it will go over 100 if you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my selecting when I do this stuff,
I'm doing it in a in a light depth hoop
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm looking for stuff that finishes
early because I know what you guys want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, two million day, whatever,
when we can have the same package in 80
[SPEAKER_00]: days, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm not overlooking that we may
lose something in later flower times
[SPEAKER_00]: either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm still paying attention to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to ask you, because for the
longest time, I had always seen this most
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's of your chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you get it like like with those
really swollen bracts and the purple look?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an outdoor photo from memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might even be I think it might be
Darwall's chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's it's that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of them's from Snow High and one
of them's from Kirby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kirby did a back cross and he wasn't he
wasn't supposed to, but he did it anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to hold the pack of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put that to the to the Snow High and
worked it out into what I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buying chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the traits I remember,
the smells, the look, the you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower looked like and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a couple, you know, a couple of
runs of that, that was pretty easy because
[SPEAKER_00]: that line's pretty much an IBL anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just put my hand on it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think one of the things which
always caught me about it was that it
[SPEAKER_01]: looked so modern for a strain that
obviously was old world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you got Snow High working it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Howard, which is Darrow spelt
backwards, working it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got Herbie working it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me working it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got three, four breeders on the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not just dumbasses, we're
breeders, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we we we're looking for stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for traits and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to have after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's going to have a modern,
you know, cola, nice, looking flower kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're still radical ties,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reminds me of what do they say?
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a village to raise a child.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of those things, man,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're looking at it right there
in that in that photograph, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, we touched on it a bit earlier,
but I'd love to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a passionate organic grower myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to hear a little bit about
your grow style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you mentioned it's organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the general things you
think are important to focus on in your
[SPEAKER_01]: organic grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's just soil food web gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we work with the soil food web,
not against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes, funguses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many things that we utilize
that enhance this experience on a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: level, man, that just takes this to a
different place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we've educated people on all
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm the first guy to use aloe,
OK, and post it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hammered it out an icy mag 10 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all hammered out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mess is still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've you know, they've gone in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got banned and all this other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, what happened was we had a
big group on icy mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, my thread was leading the
fucking charge on icy mag every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biggest threat ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, biggest threat ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biggest fucking this and that ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but it was just good fun for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were teaching people and learning
and doing all this other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just busted everything open and
everybody came together at once and really
[SPEAKER_00]: took it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everything, enzymes,
microbes, fungus, fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: ionic reactions, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so we put all that
information in one package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm not going to just tell
everybody it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to pay for it because
I don't want to do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but you're working with the soil
food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the main things that makes this
all work is the fact that you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: increase negative ionic surface area in
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only one in all this hydroponic
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cheating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cheating the system by tricking
the system with with with ions and anion.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it's a trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the weed shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can increase negative ionic surface
area and how we do this is we add those
[SPEAKER_00]: things into the soil, compost,
the humic material, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Earthworm castings, humic material,
anything that has that that that value,
[SPEAKER_00]: like basalt rock dust, for example,
has a paramagnetic negative charge on it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's igneous rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's every freaking mineral known to man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's immediately uptakeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll burn your plants with it if you
don't follow this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now there we go again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just increased in our negative
ionic, you know, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting more calcium,
you get more magnesium and all the system
[SPEAKER_00]: works better if you have those negative
attraction sites.
And.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go into this in more detail in
another time, but what I can tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: right now is the way you can get this is
through compost, earthworm castings and
[SPEAKER_00]: using those inert materials like like char
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, char isn't humic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't unfold to accept more ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a carbon 14 frame which will
hold ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humic molecule, this is what's weird
about it, actually unfolds to accept more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just this weird mechanism that the
whole earth runs on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look it up and read about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the better studies come out of
Germany on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, check it out, you know, check it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess I would be interested to
ask you, are there any things which over
[SPEAKER_01]: the years you've realized are probably
more important?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess the obvious one is like in
organics, watering when you do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: how much that's pretty important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other things which you think
I like should really have attention paid
[SPEAKER_01]: to them or not so much?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just that, you know,
once you change the negative ionic surface
[SPEAKER_00]: area in your soil, your whole game
changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever food you use is going to have
an effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go and buy whatever at the grow
store, it's going to it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go and I get some horseshit,
it's going to work too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as long as that mechanism is
there, as long as that attraction is
[SPEAKER_00]: there, as long as those attraction sites
are functional, you know, as long as you
[SPEAKER_00]: have them in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see people with growing in
cocoa corn, oh, how come my plants are...
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in their material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even have a negative charge on
it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's that simple, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed when I was reading through some
of the old posts, I had seen that there
[SPEAKER_01]: was at one point, at least there was some
talk of you leaving ICMAG, starting your
[SPEAKER_01]: own forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you ever want to pursue
or not so much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: They banned us because they thought they
were spying on us in a private group in
[SPEAKER_00]: ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had an advanced living soil private
page, you know, and there were mods in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the mods nark us out to like
skip or somebody, you know, these guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: they're talking about going to the seed
depot because they say we suck here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is when this seed depot
opened up and whoever that what was that
[SPEAKER_00]: guy's name?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but he ran off with
everybody's money or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, he opened up the seed depot
and or whatever that that forum was or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the hell that thing was called.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he made me a mod and made other people
mod.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a big section there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's where we took over at
the forum again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then that collapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got busted doing something or ripping
people off or some shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we created our own website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which got really big, super big,
massive members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knew about it, but it was
private because we get sick of dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with fucking dumbasses and trolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're going to come in here
and start shit, you're out, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and people did get banned
because they would do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would argue and fight and just go
against the progression of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, of course, you're getting fucking
banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of those problems reflect on me
now because of the people we banned back
[SPEAKER_00]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like Dank Frank and all those
other disgruntled employee vibe people,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, their butt hurt because they
didn't get what they wanted out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get they didn't get my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't get to be a mod or they,
you know, it's some kind of entitlement
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, you know, and they were never even
hired.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all volunteer shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see people often get very passionate
and involved in these sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a bit of a longer question here
to ask you, but it was one that sort of I
[SPEAKER_01]: was hoping to get around to and this seems
like a good point to jump into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, as I was sort of doing some
research for our chat, I came across some
[SPEAKER_01]: posts of people who sort of said that
their experiences with you were a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit questionable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then many of those same people would
go on to put a post up and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, you know, hey guys, Gas contacted me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's made everything all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made me sort of wonder,
you know, was there maybe a specific time
[SPEAKER_01]: or incident where maybe orders weren't
sort of going out as we might want or
[SPEAKER_01]: something which might explain why there
was this hiccup?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm confident that you're not a fraud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of the posts go on to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it appears some people did have blips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The posts are made by those very same
people I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the repeat offenders.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, they're the repeat guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got mad because I didn't let them
release this or got mad because they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get them that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actively follow me around and
troll my ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, we've we've worked with a lot of
distributors and we're trying to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor that we can rely on and get
our shit out there when we need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's been a hard game,
man, because 10 years of mail and fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, dude, at every fucking post office
and every fucking place up here and get
[SPEAKER_00]: busted and only stupid ass is filling out
the wrong thing, getting us crack,
[SPEAKER_00]: busting our shit in that post office.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fucked up that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to go this one year after year after
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you got to do is read my instructions
and you can figure it out that we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: done with the bullshit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do the shit right or don't do
it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not to the point right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want I'm just ready to give their
money back if they're going to give me any
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you don't follow the
instructions, you're going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: flipping me and shit and then expecting
that that I'm going to just jump out of
[SPEAKER_00]: bed at three o'clock in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look, I can certainly appreciate
that when you hear stories from some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the older members in the community who are
like, man, back in the day, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sending off money to Amsterdam is not
tracked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you just got to put your
faith in it and it all worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, but all these guys,
they rip you off, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, oh, I didn't get my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I didn't get my seeds trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so every order, man,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we don't have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't get and get my seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've seen every trick in the
book, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would say 50% of the time,
it's a positive experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% of the time, it's a pain in the
fucking ass because these guys are really
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking entitled, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, yeah, as someone who has sold seeds
themselves, I certainly feel like there
[SPEAKER_01]: are some very high expectations at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember one guy, he like made payment
on the seeds and like within an hour he's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, where's the tracking number?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give me a minute, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are these guys, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a fucking drone is just going to come
drop them at your fucking feet in five
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do is we take orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a thing now where we take orders
for two weeks and then we pack seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: we send them to our distributor who then
sends them to you because we're done,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're done going to post offices.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work anymore for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We Guardian Family Tree is our distributor
now and we're happy to work with them and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing a good job and they're
getting our shit out there and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot less mix ups now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anyone who's keen on getting some of
your gear, that sounds like a good spot to
[SPEAKER_01]: stop by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have an Instagram or they
primarily website sort of thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe they have a website and they
have an Instagram page and they distribute
[SPEAKER_00]: other people's seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've found myself working with seed banks
who prioritize like customer service and
[SPEAKER_01]: quick shipping has always worked really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a good relationship with
people and everything's flowing good and
[SPEAKER_00]: right, everybody's happy, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these guys get their seeds in a
decent amount of time and.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, sometimes weird shit
happens, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a more personal question, I was lucky
enough to be gifted some of your NL5
[SPEAKER_01]: Hayes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's the F4.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be the F5.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the F4.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got any tips for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any certain phenos you think I should keep
an eye out for?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your recommendations?
[SPEAKER_00]: The F4 will probably be pretty good,
but it's not as refined as the F6,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because every time I go through
them, I go through a lot of numbers and I
[SPEAKER_00]: always get rid of the shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was intersects in that
line from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now at F6, I don't see, I don't see
intersects anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's possible in F4, you might see some
nanner, maybe, but unlikely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say 99% no, you know, but you're
going to see more Sativa expressions back
[SPEAKER_00]: at F4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's got me excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's no joke, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is the herb that you're
like, it's going to sit in your jar for
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe a year because you'll, you know,
you're not going to smoke it that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you got to be excited now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, oh, and I was also going to say,
I feel like as growers, people need to
[SPEAKER_01]: accept that every now and again,
you're going to get a plant with a nanner
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the world keeps turning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's something that people don't
realize is that you can take these stable
[SPEAKER_00]: lines and give them a little bit of stress
and guess what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress anything and stuff, man,
that I've worked so hard on and I give it
[SPEAKER_00]: a little stress and boom, you know,
it's just the nature of the beast,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't, you can't,
you can't get rid of something that's part
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and if you bring any condition
that's going to wake that up, it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to wake up, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, let's, let's go back to the question
we used to start off the interviews with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about your very first experience
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, probably as a kid,
you know, I started smoking herb in the
[SPEAKER_00]: seventies, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, parents smoked herb with their
kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, you know, it wasn't so
frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think, oh, what was the seventies
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everybody smoked pot, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere you went, everybody smoked pot,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I didn't tell my mom I was smoking
pot in fourth grade, man, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I go out with my friends after pinching
some tie stick off them or something and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and go smoke it after school
with them and chase ducks at the park or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you know, play football or
frisbee or something, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: until we had to go home and eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess somewhere around sixth
grade, I went and lived with my dad.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad was way more heady, you know,
biker.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was teach, he didn't give a fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, whatever, just don't make a
habit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we get big, but when I was
13, 14, I was getting bong hits for
[SPEAKER_00]: allowance, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day dude would leave a bong hit on
the counter for me and my brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: After we got on the bus, cause he didn't
want us, he didn't put the weed out
[SPEAKER_00]: before, you know, we got on the bus,
but after school, man, we'd raise each
[SPEAKER_00]: other home, you know, to get the bong
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your shit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he wanted us to do our chores first,
you know, do the dishes, clean up the
[SPEAKER_00]: house, vacuum and all this other shit
before we smoked our herb, because he
[SPEAKER_00]: knew, you know, if we smoked our herb,
we just sit there and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we obliged him, we did our chores
first before we smoked our herb and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how our lives were.
[SPEAKER_00]: We scored weed for our parents all
throughout our teenage years, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does really make you realize it's been
quite a shift in the dynamic, hasn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a different, it was a different world
growing up in the Pacific Northwest,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was, it really was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, we were just isolated from
the rest of the world as far as like the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis culture thing went, you know,
that you had your cannabis culture in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, which was kind of like the
culture up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had our own little bubble up here,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's very lucky indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we move forward a little bit,
what stimulated you to do your first grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd grown an herb, you know,
like I said, as a, as a kid with my
[SPEAKER_00]: parents, we just, that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took care of the plants as they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: We watered them, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't grow myself, you know,
because I'd left home and wanted to just
[SPEAKER_00]: go be a person, you know, and did all that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to college, Grateful Dead and all
that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just my fascination still lied in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wanted to be one of these
guys, I didn't realize it back then,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I wanted to be one of these guys,
the white lab coat and working in a lab
[SPEAKER_00]: and taking tissue cultures and doing all
this crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't realize back then that I was
working for the wrong team if I was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to continue down that path.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made a decision, you know,
after all several Grateful Dead shows,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to, to freelance this and do it
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started, you know, I started breeding
probably, oh, 93, throwing pollen around
[SPEAKER_00]: and making my own seeds just for
environmental purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most of the stuff that we were
getting out of the seed banks or a cut
[SPEAKER_00]: from your buddy or whatever, your aft
gooey cut you got, it didn't make it,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're up here, we're getting
frosts in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a crop to finish it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I started doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started breeding four crops that
finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by 2000, I had types that, you know,
that would, could withstand cellular
[SPEAKER_00]: damage of, you know, minus whatever
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would finish in, you know,
early October and you'd get a harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's one of the first creations you
made where you were like really proud of
[SPEAKER_01]: it and you were like, fuck, I could like
sell this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think it was, uh, I got,
uh, what used to be called Eugene green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I crossed it to an old Oregon
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I crossed it to the Alaskan
Thunderfuck, an old Alaskan Thunderfuck
[SPEAKER_00]: from up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had been around a long time,
probably 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guy grew at 7,000 feet in just a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of the phenotypes finish in
July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them finish in October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are two feet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are 14 feet high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but it was the real Alaskan
Thunderfuck, a nice red, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: dark plants that, that Alaskan smell and
everything said, I knew that that's what I
[SPEAKER_00]: got to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to bring this modern flower into
this bag, you know, and I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of curiosity, I think I'm just
probably a bit uneducated in this aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think are the genetics behind
the, uh, ATF?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's like, it's got a Russian in it
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A ruderalis, but I don't think it was a
tribal, you know, like nowadays it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: a tribal drug type.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays you have tribal drugs,
drug types that are auto flowers from as
[SPEAKER_00]: far north as 50, 50 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a bunch of them, man,
you know, but auto flowers don't fascinate
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's just dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's boring breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think to a certain extent that
autos are sort of always going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat inferior to photo period?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think there will come a day
where they're a bit more equal playing
[SPEAKER_01]: field?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a friend right now who last year did
nothing but breed autos and the results
[SPEAKER_00]: were pretty neat, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He used a bunch of my stuff and I was
like, wow, that looks just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: original, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's potential in it and there's use
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I wouldn't say I'm like Jeff
Lowenfels and I'm going to predict that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the wave of the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember when he said that on the show,
I'm sure he said it other places as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when he said it on the show,
there was a few listeners who were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that'll be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I gave him some of the one by a
Kazakhstan too, to take up to Alaska.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know whatever happened to it,
but I'm pretty sure, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it did throw off those auto flower traits
up there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think I've asked you,
but I'd be interested to know,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you consider yourself more of a
concentrate or flower guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like flowers, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a bong guy or joints?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bong man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bong, bong, bong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I was like, you know, 14 years old
or some shit, bong it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some period in my life,
somewhere in my twenties, I thought joints
[SPEAKER_00]: was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: While I was while I was driving concrete
mixer or something, you know, but I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: even smoke a joint without hacking now,
man, you know, paper, I can't stand that
[SPEAKER_00]: paper, man, you know, and the dabs,
dude, I'm just, I'm just, I'm not into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get so much more out of the flower,
so much more, so much more pleasure,
[SPEAKER_00]: so much more effect than this just big
glob of fucking, you know, silly humans,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, always wanting more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you just perfectly expressed my
feelings on that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I just get so much more out of
flowers and I never really vibe with the
[SPEAKER_01]: dabs, but I think it's probably related to
tolerance and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's value to keeping your
tolerance to dabs low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't, I just, why, you know,
like I said, I can take one hit of black
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombian and be teed up right,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Function taught be, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we sort of touched on this a little bit
earlier, but I'd love to just flesh it out
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly more.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the last thing you smoked that
left a really lasting, impactful memory
[SPEAKER_01]: for you where you were like, wow,
that was neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walking by chocolate die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's what I'm after.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to say it too loud,
but I guess I just did, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't got many seeds left,
but you know, once you say that,
[SPEAKER_00]: people want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice herb, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like one hit and you're
like, wow, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you feel like a little pin again,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like it could be like very
haze-esque.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the phenotypes are maybe too
potent, you know, for functionality,
[SPEAKER_00]: but most of them are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you find the right one,
so, so what I'm going to do is I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to, I'm just going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make a blueberry just because
just because I can, because I have velvet
[SPEAKER_00]: rush, you know, you know what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask, I got a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about velvet rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Velvet rush is Afghani number one by
Highland blue tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the brother of eternal loves
Highland blue tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was imported from 76 to 77 for 15
months in military cargo shipments via
[SPEAKER_00]: plane that landed in 29 Palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when they distributed it, it was the
best thing going around, but it only
[SPEAKER_00]: lasted for 15 months because when the man
got wind of it, they shut it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why that little amount of
Highland blue tie was around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So collectors, you know, Mel Frank,
DJ, whoever obviously found out about it
[SPEAKER_00]: and got ahold of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, anyway, it was DJ who, who crossed
the Highland blue tie to the Afghani
[SPEAKER_00]: number one, the Kabul.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mailed from Kabul in 79 to Mel
Frank, you know, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened was DJ worked the line
and somewhere back there in his workings
[SPEAKER_00]: gave some seed to Mel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when the brotherhood had a barbecue in
Eugene, Oregon in 1986, Mel Frank was
[SPEAKER_00]: there and so was Coot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so were other brotherhood guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Coot and Mel hit it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mel gave back the brotherhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The velvet rush, the other half,
you know, it was molested, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: Highland blue tie got back to the
brotherhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Coot gave it to the brotherhood down in
San Clemente and they took it in the hills
[SPEAKER_00]: and they grew up for six or seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said every color in the rainbow was
in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were nothing but bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like Christmas trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably 20 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just monsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did that for however many years,
five, six years, and then put the seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, put the seed away for however
long that was from 91 till 2010 when I got
[SPEAKER_00]: it and opened them up and repopulated
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I did give it back to DJ.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like pretty quickly too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like here, man, you know, no thanks,
no nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, I went on his page and icy mag
and posted all velvet rush and blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, look, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a word.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're just scared that I was
going to do what I did with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, after being just dissed,
I did, I released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the brotherhood line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not yours anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, I just, I just, I BL it and
keep it as original.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_00]: By Island blue tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have the will Hawkin by the
chocolate tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them together and make a blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no fucking patent on that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, can we expect to see that
offering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do that this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm halfway through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be neat for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I know a lot of people really want
that like F1 blueberry, not like the F5 or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever DJ has got it at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not that I'm trying to copy the
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a fascination in how that
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to see it for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to experience that for myself
and through my own hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I'm going to, Oh, I'm going to
make a bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not my trip, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I'm more, I'm more into just
seeing the fascination of the line,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how these things work together,
the way that will Hawkin works with the
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate and the way that the,
the tie works with the Afghani in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that Afghan shit dude, that's one of
the shittiest Afghans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See that that's really interesting for me
because I think the thing that you
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently read about blueberry is that
people are like, I want the early version,
[SPEAKER_01]: which had like, you know, the blueberry
muffin sort of smell the new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't even smell blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always wondered like, why did he
like, he says, oh, you know, I bred for
[SPEAKER_01]: the effect, not the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, yeah, but if you had
blueberry muffin, like why would you wait
[SPEAKER_00]: on the old blueberry this morning?
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked some old blueberry by velvet
rush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back across to velvet rush is fucking
dynamite.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to the hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potent shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not a lot of berry flavor in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's kind of just highland blue tie,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the old Oregon blueberry, which I have
had and have and worked with, I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: ever get any males out of the old pack I
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why I didn't do the line,
but I did outcross two appropriate types.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I did the back across to
velvet rush just because.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are they available at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's intersects in the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good ones are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, this is what blueberry is
supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now somewhere in, I don't know when DJ did
it, but he put another indica in the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry and that's what the world knew
as blueberry when it was released.
[SPEAKER_00]: That nice glossy leather leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saying it was an NL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was an NL.
[SPEAKER_00]: NL1 or NL5 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: As in like, just to confirm, like as in he
had like a sort of blueberry clone and
[SPEAKER_01]: then he hit something to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those were sort of the seeds that
you think went out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole profile changed from sativa to
indica like overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people were like, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the Oregon blueberry sativa we
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome to hear about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone, I recommend you go grab those
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to just jump to a different
cross of yours for a moment because I had
[SPEAKER_01]: noticed that you released the Nigerian
sunshine a while ago and that also used
[SPEAKER_01]: the blue moon rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that the same male that you crossed to
the one?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same male I used on all the
blue moon rocks crossings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why all of those look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: That big giant bog bubblegum flower top,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, would you be able to give us
any of the backstory on the Nigerian?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Nigerians are Australian that are
always well received, but hard to find
[SPEAKER_01]: info on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Nigerian is a brotherhood Nigerian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was brought back from Nigeria in 1976
by a brotherhood couple who were fleeing
[SPEAKER_00]: persecution from the feds, you know,
and went to Africa to look for exotic
[SPEAKER_00]: textiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they brought back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they grew it from seed and found that
particular cut that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a couple, and another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there were two cuts that they'd had
since like 1978 or 79 kept as cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was nothing on earth like this.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing on earth like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Nigerian out in California,
some big sir somewhere that's the same
[SPEAKER_00]: one, but it's not the same one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's busted up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's outcrossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know, I know the cat who has this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also had the brotherhood Karela.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also had the sister, the only other
living sister of the one in blue orca,
[SPEAKER_00]: which they call Mary Poppins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, man, I was like,
God, I don't just want to take it all
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm just greedy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't, Oh no, it's cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm just kicking myself in the ass
about it because it could have had that
[SPEAKER_00]: Karela and Mary Poppins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Nigerian was lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a 76 Nigerian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on a rocket ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you never been on your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I outcrossed it to, um,
and if a former employee lost the cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I don't have it, it killed it,
lost it gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only thing I have is the blooming
rocks and, and everything, every time I
[SPEAKER_00]: get into that line, I'm always looking for
that Nigerian.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, there's a guy, uh,
boy, forget his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, synergy genetics on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a nice expression of a Nigerian
sunshine with that Nigerian expression
[SPEAKER_00]: popping out nice and big.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to, if you want to see what
you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to all go suss that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we quickly jumped to another
strain that I think, uh, is quite notable,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be really grateful to hear your
thoughts on cherry bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like the, the infamous Maui Waui
sort of variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's not one you find a lot of info
on, but you hear it whispered about it by
[SPEAKER_01]: the heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Greenjeans gave me the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, you know, he gave me the permission to
breed and sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know what happened to the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He seemed dropped off the earth,
man, for a number of years and people
[SPEAKER_00]: thought he was dead or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he wasn't dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what happened, but anyway,
he said here, the line is yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's always been intersects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jerry bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real Maui Waui.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a, it's, it's, it's a,
it's a, it's a Wauhaken by a brotherhood
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's brotherhood Wauhaken by brotherhood
Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no tie in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what can I tell you about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that they think all these
Maui's, you know, most Maui's in fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: all Maui's have intersects problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they say it's because of the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights when they were bringing it back in
the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I just don't know, you know,
it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, the line carries intersects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since I got ahold of it, I've bred it
for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I get in there,
I try to get rid of that shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so now we're sitting pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sitting pretty good with our cherry
bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it, but it's, but it's just cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a, it's just a Maui.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, there's no tie in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, it's, it's a, what I call
medium duty herb, you know, stuff you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: give your mom or your dad and,
you know, not, not wig them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Novelty stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, mom, have some Maui Waui.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's so interesting because I
think like, I, I'd be interested to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: you earlier, you mentioned that,
you know, the brotherhood was sort of like
[SPEAKER_01]: a combo of like bikers and surfers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like the genetics,
like the breeding itself was mostly done
[SPEAKER_01]: by sort of the more surfer side of Bowel
or it was literally by a mixture?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was, it was straight up hippies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these weren't just hippies,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were freaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're, they have some far out
philosophies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're chowing on LSD and DMT and they
were woo, you know, but they were the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest distributors of the hash and herb
and LSD on the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a pretty big organization and
they were, they were doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by 1971, they were all busted up.
[SPEAKER_00]: CIA got in there and got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they all fled, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason that this stuff keeps
popping up, oh, 76, 77, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, is because they would meet up later
and say, Hey, let's do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take one more run around the track.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're going to loop back,
but before we do, you mentioned 76,
[SPEAKER_01]: 77, and it just sprung a thought to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on the whole Uncle
Fester skunk story?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant kind of looks like an RKS,
but I don't believe that the lineage goes
[SPEAKER_00]: back to 68.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't fucking believe it because none of
it adds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that adds up is the leaf
morphology and the fact that it may be
[SPEAKER_00]: from bikers, but it doesn't match with the
rest of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the skunk isn't the skunk that fits
the skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people say, Oh yeah,
man, it's good, you know, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not trying to diss it or anything,
but I don't think it's real.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember now I wanted to add in that
kudos to you with the cherry bomb,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I did find some posts from Mr.
Greenjeans last night when I was reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: He quite emphatically says in all his
posts that he feels you improved the line
[SPEAKER_01]: from when he gave it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sort of talks, he didn't mention
stability, which is interesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: but he just sort of generally says it's
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that's what he was talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I got it, there was a lot of
sativa expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, when I breed,
I try to breed, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not growing in a fucking shoe box in
an apartment somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go and we're going to bust
open a bunch of seed and we're going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: a proper selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I saw that there was all these
sativa expressions, I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what happened to the Indica Indica
expressions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to put that back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to balance that out a little bit
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily I found a nice looking male
fucking cherry bomb, man, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that had a nice fat Indica profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, okay, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, you know, it brought the Indica
back into the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, and now we're, now we're a little
more resin, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, while we're on the topic,
I'd love to ask you, are there any
[SPEAKER_01]: specific characteristics that you look for
as a sign of a good male?
[SPEAKER_00]: Males are really deceptive, you know,
because they're all, they all look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have a tendency to look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really tell until you really put
it through the paces till you get it up
[SPEAKER_00]: and you beat it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Damage it, run into it, smack it around,
you know, damage it is what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see how, how well that vigor continues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going to lie to me, I'm going to
know right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tricky, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do things that you would not
believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be looking down here for all,
for six months pulling males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then six months later, look up,
there's a male that somehow snuck around
[SPEAKER_00]: your, your, your site and climbed up a
fucking tree and put a big flower head
[SPEAKER_00]: above everybody and went, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's quite deceptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like these things have minds of their
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a good male is they're, they're
usually easy to find, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause they like to express themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, yeah, I'm a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually, they usually look pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually have like 10, 20 good males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh no, you know, which one do I
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often use two males on one female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that can be an interesting
breeding technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a lot of reasons for
doing that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess to ask specifically, a lot of
breeders commonly will say, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I feel like the most vigorous,
fastest growing males that can be a more
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp trait than a drug trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you sort of disagree with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a standard process?
[SPEAKER_01]: You go through of putting them through the
gauntlet, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's, it's, that's just rumor,
man, because just, you know, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: have a male that'll just boom,
boom, boom, and just blow big fat leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd just be a monster, you know,
and everything he does and every female he
[SPEAKER_00]: touches, no matter what it is,
is always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the NL5 Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you take any, any NL5 Haze good
male and touch anything with it and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about 50-50 on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just as a sort of one, I probably
should have asked back when we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about grow mediums, but I think
you'd have a great answer for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use the same general sort of soil
mix slash approach to growing when you say
[SPEAKER_01]: grow like a land race variety versus say
something more, a little more modern,
[SPEAKER_01]: or do you find you have to factor in that
sensitivity?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the same soil on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The traits that I recognize that that are
different are like drought tolerance,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, okay, that one is from
cyanide.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't get water today because it's
not going to like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't give it water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those are the, the growing,
the things that I see is just
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions, not more traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driven stuff because they all,
they all behave the same as cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they flower or they,
they grow the flower, they die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I took a look at the website and I
noticed that the, the 2022 menu looked
[SPEAKER_01]: like it was a lot more tighter,
sort of more focused, a little scaled back
[SPEAKER_01]: than say the 2021 menu, which was a bit
more comprehensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there any particular reason you
decided you want to sort of focus on a
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller number of varieties?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was still quite a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like 10 or something,
you know, not, not a small number by any
[SPEAKER_01]: means, but was there a reason you wanted
to scale things back and just focus on
[SPEAKER_01]: these specific lines a little more?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just getting tired, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I figured, well, everybody's,
you know, a couple of years ago I figured,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, everybody's doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better get out there and bust some ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I better get out there and just kick ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did, you know, two, three years in a
row, just kicked ass, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: woke up microdosed every day, ate a good
breakfast, you know, drinking spring
[SPEAKER_00]: water, run around half fucking naked and
just, yeah, we're going to do,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving pots around soil, just throwing
around like there's no tomorrow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, breeding this, breeding that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a, there's a point where
every day I'm going out and breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's becoming a monotonous task where
you're like, okay, I gotta go do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're out there and you're,
you're rubbing stems, you're checking leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: morphology, you're doing all this shit and
under the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, it's a job,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and after a couple of years of going
on it on that scale, like I did,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a world fucking record,
two years in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: After two years, after two years of that,
dude, I was like, oh my God, this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I have all these projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just need to, to calm down, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I just scaled back for my own
health, really, you know, cause I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: running too hard, man, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people may not be
aware.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly wasn't that you, you sort of
do a lot of your work off grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my work is off grid now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got out probably five years ago,
just, just said, no, I'm not doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got out on the land and you know,
now we're doing domes, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you find that lifestyle?
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel like it's really conducive to
sort of what you're doing and how you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to live?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only lifestyle for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's the only way for me,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drink spring water every day,
you know, I get my water from the spring,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I breathe clean air, I live 25,
2,500 feet up on top of a mountain,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had no neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: No neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had neighbors, you know, but you can't
see them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just forest, a nice first forest that I'm
in, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: The dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot, you know, it's harder to come by
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a lot of people wanting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of work though, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wake up and I bust ass every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another thing people don't
understand, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm off grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got to work to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Priorities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You made me just feel so lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like, yeah, I could just sit
here all day and like, water's still going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be there when I want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, you got to go get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, you know, and I'm pretty fit
too, you know, because of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get out there and throw shit around and
fucking, you know, pretty fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it keeps me fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps me active.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truly, truly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know, you know, the biggest thing is
I never see a stoplight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can drive miles and miles and miles and
never see a stoplight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, I normally ask
breeders whether they feel it's necessary
[SPEAKER_01]: to be active on the Instagram scene in
order to sort of be a breeder in the
[SPEAKER_01]: current market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd really like to hear your opinions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just because you're obviously not as
invested as others, but more importantly,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're off the grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm sure that's an additional hurdle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the internet shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't get good bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't load pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes your messages don't come
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you don't get your emails until
two days later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have an antenna booster and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just how it is out in the middle of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the signal strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like it detrimentally affects
your ability to interact with the market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you think like, no, I can still
interact with the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because the way these apps are set up,
they have advertising priority of
[SPEAKER_00]: bandwidth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, priority, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got ads to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I may not be able to post pictures
when I want, but I can eventually do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got to wait for the bandwidth to
come rolling around again, and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but like you said, do these guys have
to be on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point in the game,
yes and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't make a presence, you're not
going to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get buried in the
marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get buried.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to know you're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be out here for 10, 15,
20 years, man, and get buried under all
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody even know you're there if you don't
make a presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you got to have a presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have to have some kind of
presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the follow-up to that I wanted to
ask is, do you feel any level of,
[SPEAKER_01]: how shall I say, like disillusion with
sort of the way the market trends are
[SPEAKER_01]: going?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at the moment, we're very much
in the thick of the Mylar bag hype
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any part of the way that the
trajectory of the scene's going that sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of has you a bit bummed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think like, no, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just doing its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, a lot of the times I can
predict what's going to happen next,
[SPEAKER_00]: but lately it's been really kind of
chaotic with the marketing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, which way is anything going
to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's pretty loud out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: With noise, with products and people
pumping this and people pumping that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I feel sorry for the consumer,
man, because they're getting hit with so
[SPEAKER_00]: much misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have more people now asking me what they
want from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to tell them what they want
from me than what they come to me and
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to tell them, oh, you want,
you want the mazar giro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you want the haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually like a really unique
perspective that I think I'm going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: to pay more thought to, because,
yeah, I think it is hard as a newbie or
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who's just entering the market to
know, yeah, like what's true, what's
[SPEAKER_01]: false, what's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know because there's so much
noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people are just trying to sell a
product and that they don't give a fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: about you, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's interesting that you
mention that because one of the criticisms
[SPEAKER_01]: I had heard of this show, in fact,
is that people might listen to certain
[SPEAKER_01]: things and yet take it for gospel when
really it's just one person's account of
[SPEAKER_01]: things and it's not necessarily true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess that's actually sort of one of
the reasons why I started the show is that
[SPEAKER_01]: I never proclaim anything as 100% true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to share everyone's
stories and then you can pick and choose
[SPEAKER_01]: what you think is sort of the real deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's interesting because, yeah,
a lot of people do take what they read
[SPEAKER_01]: online as like 100% the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, maybe there's other aspects of
the story, which, you know, like what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about earlier when people
maybe read a bad review online and they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all the information that they're
putting out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's false.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reality is, if you're going to get
trolled by somebody that wants you not to
[SPEAKER_00]: succeed, they're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't have nothing better to do,
that's what they're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got these guys all over me,
you know, because I didn't give them
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 seed when they wanted it or
whatever the fuck, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some crazy demand or some crazy shit where
I'm like, okay, well, I'm just done with
[SPEAKER_00]: you, bro, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get so hot, hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to go out there and talk mad
shit, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mad shit, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get on them fucking forums and I get
on those platforms, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in there and I chew their ass out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give all the facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give all the information and they
fucking ban me and fucking I'm out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there and nobody hears the fucking truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, fuck roll it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck I see, Meg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck all those douchebags.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's douchebags, dude, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: The way they slander people and let people
treat people the way they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been thinking as a bit of a
joke, we need to we need to breed some
[SPEAKER_01]: anti grudge weed and just hand it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got tons of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to keep these grudges on
people, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to progress and move forward
and do all this dumb shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here they come again, you know,
climbing up your coattails and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, trying to empty your pockets or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, while you're while you're giving
water to your kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had I had one question that might be a
little bit of a funny one, but I found an
[SPEAKER_01]: old forum post and I'm not sure if it was
tongue in cheek or what, but I was hoping
[SPEAKER_01]: you could give us the backstory where you
had said that you were selling some seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Blue Orca Hayes crossed the Velvet
Rush and was listed as fifty thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars cash only.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, that's got to be a funny
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the backstory behind that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I just did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what my competitors do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get my shit, cross it to what I
have, what I'm doing, and then go sneak
[SPEAKER_00]: around on Instagram to some auction and
try to sell it for some ridiculous high
[SPEAKER_00]: price.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so like, oh, ten million
dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, bro, I don't think any cut
is worth more than five hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I have so much genetic potential
in my library.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you've got you definitely got the
base palette to to mix the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in effect, turps, everything,
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you know, if what every breeder
wants, they just want to be turned loose
[SPEAKER_00]: and and to breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's always the fantasy of every
serious breeder is just let me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me let me out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put me to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to I want to move through
a selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to select out of ten thousand
parents, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I'll I'll bring it up because I
think this was actually one of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: which I saw recently and it stimulated me
to message you was I think you put a post
[SPEAKER_01]: up relating to some of the comments Todd
McCormick had made about Skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the listeners of the show,
they would know we had Todd on recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to put it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like Todd.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like I learned a lot during that
chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to know, you know,
what was sort of some of the issues you
[SPEAKER_01]: took with some of the statements he made
about the Roadkill Skunk?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not I'm not recalling anything on
Roadkill Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of the flack I'm getting from
the Todd camp is the NL1 stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I post at Neville's NL1,
man, I get an army of fucking trolls from
[SPEAKER_00]: Todd's camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, no, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg knew that NL1 was sent to Amsterdam
and Neville put a napkin or a Hindu on it
[SPEAKER_00]: and sent it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For years, we knew that Howard Marks knows
that everybody knows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't come along and change the
narrative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that never happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I post NL1, man, I get that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dwight, all these people that know the
truth just keep saying the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Greg even says so himself,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says it says it himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen to the interview people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not making any claims about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just I'm just experienced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else, everybody is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for clarification, when you say
Greg's interview, is that the one he did
[SPEAKER_01]: with Matt Wright?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I'm not sure which which one it
was, but yeah, he says it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says it himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for anyone who's keen to listen,
I think that might have been the Breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: Syndicate podcast with Greg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I guess it sounds like it's it's
not so much that there's any sort of real
[SPEAKER_01]: beef.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a discrepancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and you feel like there's more people
from his camp coming to yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time Dwight posts this information,
he gets trolled, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he's on LinkedIn right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He posts this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets trolled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime we post this information about
what Neville did, we get trolled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And would you just for anyone to save them
sort of clicking around from different
[SPEAKER_01]: things, could you quickly recap that story
for us about how it all went down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The NL one or what I remember?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not on point because this isn't my
shit, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But OK, this is what I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, Greg sent Neville in cassette tapes
the Pacific Northwest Tash plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Lights, L.I.T.E.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville bred it to his Afghan or Hindu
Afghan Hindu or Afghan Ash plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the two, and sent it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when Greg or whoever and they
crossed it out to a bunch of shit and then
[SPEAKER_00]: sent it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like a back and forth sort of
thing for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like we do nowadays, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally, totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, cool, cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Neville did the work because
Neville had the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why Greg was working with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually had a fan submitted a question
about one of your NL5 BX.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know if I pay, so it might be a good
time to bring it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our listener basically wanted to know
if you had any information on what they or
[SPEAKER_01]: you called the pine box release of the NL5
back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's just one of the parents that
had a really nice, piney smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how the NL5 had that pine,
lime kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really, really notable on that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they they also had a follow up
question where they were wondering how
[SPEAKER_01]: potent is the NL5 cross Hayes F5?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I don't know if we've talked about the
F5, only the F4 and F6.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't release a lot of F5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, only a few packs of those went out
of the F5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't do a big breeding of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is it as potent?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an IBL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see the same traits of
the NL5 Hayes line every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have indicative
expressions that finish earlier and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have Hayes expressions that
finish later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know that the Hayes expressions
are the ones that we tend to favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the Indica ones are more dull,
boring, ugly plants, small buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the NL5 Hayes line itself doesn't
really get mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: In any of the NL5 Hayes across the
different generations, were there any of
[SPEAKER_01]: the generations where you felt like you
were getting the the incense or like the
[SPEAKER_01]: church sort of smell from it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, all through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All through all of the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: F1, F2, all the way through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The backcross is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much chopped it up into little
pieces and took those expressions and
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated them and bred them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This purple expression I bred out,
this licorice expression I bred out,
[SPEAKER_00]: this expression, that expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So individually, you can access those
expressions if that's what you favor in
[SPEAKER_00]: those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a follow up, how does the Blue Orca
Hayes compared to, say, the NL5 Hayes,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because they are sort of similar in
some respects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Orca Hayes, man, it's like the best
weed on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like NL5 Hayes went to heaven and
came back and said, hey, we're all going
[SPEAKER_00]: to heaven now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cleans it up quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes the teeth chattering out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes the harsh vibe off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing it does, it really creates a
pretty powerful introspective behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really unique, man,
because most people that get those
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes will say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said the same thing forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you think Kelly Mist was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think this was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think that was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get on this and you're not going to come
off it for two years because nothing's
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there's nothing better.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah, it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other types out there that will
give it a run for the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be like, yeah, I want to smoke that
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I know what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that grow and have those
cuts know what it does, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can access these cuts that people
have, that they've kept.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you do the research on Blue
Orca Haze, you will find the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put this shit out for over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that brings us to the next
question really nicely in that I noticed a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people sort of talking about their
experiences of growing out the pure Blue
[SPEAKER_01]: Orca Haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of them sort of got the
impression that it was going to be like a
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly haze sort of line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that how you would describe it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what should people expect if they're
going to grow that one out?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just named it how we traditionally
name lineages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a predominantly a large amount of
haze in that breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got Blue Orca Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time anybody puts NL5 on anything,
it's always a haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: This haze, that haze, butt rump haze,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, tobacco haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people can sort of expect like a
mixture of like some Sativa, some Indica
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing as NL5 haze, man, really,
because Blue Orca is a Candahar and a
[SPEAKER_00]: Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're putting the same ingredients in,
but it kind of really enhances it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like next level enhancement, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a few more questions from our
listeners before we sort of get on the
[SPEAKER_01]: tail end of things as we are getting
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they wanted to know, what's your
experience with the Lamb's Breath?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think it's still around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the Lamb's Bread that I have was
given by Vibes Collective gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had it for whatever time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they got it from Bushman,
the reggae artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in their family since mid 60s or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, Vibes Collective, they got a hold
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got it in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lost it somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody had a pack from them and they
gave it to me and I grew them out and I
[SPEAKER_00]: repopulate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, wow, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I gave it back to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, just keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yours, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently it's a real Lamb's Breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 77 Jamaican I have is far superior
if you've seen pictures of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was taken out of the field in 77 by
a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess one of the reasons why I was
curious about this was because I had seen
[SPEAKER_01]: your photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks glorious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I thought was interesting was
whenever I talk to people about Lamb's
[SPEAKER_01]: Breath, Lamb's Bread, they all say,
oh, you know, the one you're looking at,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's actually Lamb's Bread, Sour D,
Hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That goes around, but people call it
Lamb's Bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you confident, like, yeah,
that's probably not the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty confident that I have 100%
Jamaican pre-1980 Hybrid, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I crossed those two together and I
called it Behangstra Bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave a 20% portion out of every pack to
the Behangstra movement of Rastafari,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is Earl Chinna Smith, who is one of
the greatest reggae guitarists ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's Bob Marley's guitarist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a beautiful sentiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: To give back to the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's back on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they told me they've wild-fired it
across the island.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because Dwight told me that
they went to Jamaica years ago to go check
[SPEAKER_00]: out the Maroons back in the 80s or 90s or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say they didn't have nothing
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the story, too, because I asked
the Rastas man, hey, go to the Maroons,
[SPEAKER_00]: go check out what people have.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a real shame, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing greenhouse go there and like some
kind of super safari mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, man, but there's nothing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just put it back on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to go and find my stuff and
pull it out of the bushes somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what we found.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trade him a bunch of Easter eggs for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it does make me wonder why,
because I try to get over to the States
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of once a year, maybe go to the
Emerald Cup just to keep my finger on the
[SPEAKER_01]: pulse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always see Ari in there and he's
always welcome with smiles and handshakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the name, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a name or anything,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to Howard Marks,
man?
[SPEAKER_00]: He paid like $60,000 just to have whoever
it was use his likeness until he died or
[SPEAKER_00]: some shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Shanty Barber with Mr. Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just everything's for sale,
it seems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For like a very sort of specific type of
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that, for example,
you know, we already brought it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: the greenhouse seed crew, do you think
that there is some onus on them for like
[SPEAKER_01]: the way they have arguably fucked various
land races?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fucked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fucked up what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's bad, bad, bad, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going into these regions, taking out land
races and leaving shit behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fucked up, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's that's culturally that's
like colonialism, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like Christopher Columbus shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, get the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's immoral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was trying to explain it to a
friend who's not really involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they sort of didn't understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, look, it's almost like
they're trademarking it in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they go there, they get the pure,
then they pollute it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're the only ones with the
pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they've got a copyright on it or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, they're the only ones who
have got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of that, they're not it's
not like they're releasing the lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if they released pure stuff from
greenhouse, you could be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, well, you know, there's some merit,
but they're not even doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the truth is, man, is when they
left, when those guys all split off and
[SPEAKER_00]: got, you know, what they got from Neville,
it wasn't as good as what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because my haze is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: My haze is better than theirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could probably riff on it forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other questions we got from one
of our listeners was, are you able to give
[SPEAKER_01]: us any information in regards to like the
turps or the yields on the Congo cut used
[SPEAKER_01]: in the Congo Cross BP Congo?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really an interesting plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got it from through a trade from
some guy in Africa who was there and
[SPEAKER_00]: collected it himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super, it has a lot of haze features like
it's the grease and the stem and that that
[SPEAKER_00]: that Karelin Indian scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That there's only one plant on the earth
that smells like haze and it's a Karelin
[SPEAKER_00]: Indian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some Africans have that scent,
too, and this was one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you come across that and any types
out here on Earth, you're on to something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we sort of touched on it earlier,
but I'd love to just get a definitive
[SPEAKER_01]: answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on how Greg's
Northern Lights compares to your one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think they're more similar than
different?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm just going to say it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a marketing play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: A long time ago, I had a conversation with
Kim Dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me that it's not a tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a Hawaiian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Java Indonesian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they called it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard of this before,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other guys have come at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying, yep, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be extinct now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called they called it the Java lime
green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they described it as clay on sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I saw this stuff out of that back
cross, I was like, holy shit, I never seen
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing like this in my entire fucking
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like clay on stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could smoosh it like clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that armed with that information,
I began to dissect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I figured that out that, oh,
it's not a tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't behave like a tie and never
doubted that, too, because it didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: behave like a tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we know that Herbie did in all five
and it was a Java lime green, whether he
[SPEAKER_00]: admits it or not, other people have.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what separates that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what was back to the other part of
your question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Greg's in all five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I think they did was that whatever
the story was about the seeds being the
[SPEAKER_00]: sister's freezer or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got me in a one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the original blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they did have that, but they
pulled it out and they just crossed it to
[SPEAKER_00]: any tide to try in the hopes of having in
all five again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I got several pictures of these
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a hold of Greg's five before other
people did.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through some trading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're pretty hey, they're pretty
it's either in a one or it's hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used in a one by a mysterious tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't fool me.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's really cool to hear that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the inside scoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be wrong, but I'm probably not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, while we're on the topic of NL
five, hey, we had a viewer submit a
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping it won't ruffle anyone's
feathers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to ruffle yours,
but without.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he says without throwing the guy under
the bus, I'd like to hear his experience
[SPEAKER_01]: on dealing with mob seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that mob advertising rises as
that he has a pure Acapulco gold,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it might actually be some NL five
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, you ready for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ready for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, this was a guy we met online.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and we said, come on up here and we'll
all go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know the story about
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard that name?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, he was he was part of our group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we told Bluejay, hey, come on up and
invest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will all grow big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden together, you'll be just happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he got up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He showed up with a U-Haul, some lights
and a box full of weed in baby jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, you know, it looked yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he opened up and say, I don't smoke
it, but here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm carrying all the shit around and you
don't even smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it was it was really puzzling to
us because this guy kind of sold himself
[SPEAKER_00]: as somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he shows up, he's somebody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, now he's like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we have enough money to do
this as a man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, we're just going to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He starts copping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of it he starts asking
questions about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where's Coot live?
[SPEAKER_00]: Coot, you know, you could tell this guy's
on a we start figuring out these just on a
[SPEAKER_00]: mission to get genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he didn't want to great halfway
through the night, he's like, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we got enough money and
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he starts asking information about,
hey, how can we get these cuts?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told Coot, say, hey, man,
this guy's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that night, he takes off in the
middle of the night, OK, just split.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like a weirdo, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, wow, I wonder what happened to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it our hair?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what what he done is in the middle of
the night, he went into the grow room and
[SPEAKER_00]: stole cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, but he didn't get the he didn't get
the one or a blue orca because I I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: on the ball, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just fuck her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody I know what you're up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he goes to Coot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd pre-warned it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Coot gives him BMR back across one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he gave it to him and seed
or cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I don't know where he got the Acapulco
from, but that was my
[SPEAKER_00]: my F2NL5 haze cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: He stole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this guy goes out after he fucks us and
just.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, markets himself as whatever,
and this and that starts taking my stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing it up and selling it and all this
other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, wow, this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he takes Coot's information that
he said, don't don't go and do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just sharing this information with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took Coot's enzyme tea recipe and went
and fucking sold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a douchebag, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guy's a douchebag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I ever seen that guy again,
man?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm appealing so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's appealing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look, that that's that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you hear stories about cuttings
getting stolen and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, yes, really frustrating stuff,
I bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then over the next 10 years,
the guy is releasing all this other shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that he has the one and all this
other shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, any time anybody anybody
confronts him, it's just ignore crickets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how a lot of these guys behave.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you confront them and there's no
accountability, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know that Coot and him had had a
falling out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that sort of lends itself to
what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the only these falling outs
with Coot's is it is it has a lot to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with Coot and his medical condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember one time rolling up there and
he'd been laying.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had back surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, if you broke his back and he could
barely walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he laid there was fucking back rotting
out for however long on fucking opiates
[SPEAKER_00]: before, if any, you did anything about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sometimes you'd be on the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes a guy be just like half dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, the last time I talked to
him, he had a heart attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And didn't know who we were.
[SPEAKER_00]: Said we lost his lost his collection or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, no clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to get to his wife one day
and tell her, hey, you know, we.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what's going on here,
but we don't have really have any hard
[SPEAKER_00]: feelings here, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, look, I mean, it sounds like a
medically complicated situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, obviously we wish Coot all
the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, it sounds like it would be hard
for you with things sort of changing
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on his mood, if that was how it
was.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually had a really good question
that I'm I'm a bit bummed I didn't come up
[SPEAKER_01]: with it myself, to be honest, from one of
our listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, do you have any secret
inputs or advice for producing nice,
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you reckon just, you know,
your standard organics repertoire is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to give you some nice seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here, let me give you a soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really easy and anybody can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, one part peat, one part perlite,
one part compost and earthworm castings in
[SPEAKER_00]: three equal portions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Cornell University potting mix
that's always been around that they buried
[SPEAKER_00]: because of petrochemical industry back in
the 30s.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the secret behind all your potting
mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely use that general combo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add any food you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add any calcium you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add any whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the base mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're building a battery.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Charging the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the soil is like a battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has those those ionic charges in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the plant gets in there,
it works with it through its exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ionic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants what it wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, OK, I need calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sends the signal and it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it releases it from the it releases
it from the negative attraction site and
[SPEAKER_00]: takes it, you know, molecularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you learn about that, all this gross
shit just falls away, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, you're just growing herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some great food for thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't heard that battery analogy,
but it's certainly actually makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question we got from the listeners
was someone sitting on a pack of your
[SPEAKER_01]: Cascadian Frost Cross UW Hash Plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any tips on that one, what they might be
able to expect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, those are pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nice and greasy and have nice big
spears.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, highly medical, you know,
good stoner stoner weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ain't nobody going to complain about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoever sent that one in, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have your name on hand right now,
but crack those bad boys.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sounding good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, me and me and a buddy worked
these and we both did a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So second last question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last question before we get into our quick
fire questions, which is sort of the final
[SPEAKER_01]: five or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of our listeners wanted to know if
you had any sort of info about the
[SPEAKER_01]: Thunderfuck Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that is, it's AK Beansbrains,
Matanuska, and Pharma's Sheberg and
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani, which is from Land Race.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I forget the damn name,
Land Race Collections or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Erosigno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Land Race Exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just crossed together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think AK did it, sent it back to Mike.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike sent them to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I'll just put them on top of my
Alaskan by NL Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, get all those Alaskans in there
together and see what they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get them all together and playing
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a novelty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't a serious breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a novelty just to put the Alaskans
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't really work it much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a novelty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's probably good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think novelty strains can be cool,
to be honest, but that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're on to our sort of final rundown
of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first one being, out of all the plants
you've ever grown, I know there's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: countless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there one specific one that you really
miss that you think back on at night and
[SPEAKER_01]: think, man, if only I still had that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 76 Nigerian, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a kick in the ass that was,
you know, and what a kick in the ass was
[SPEAKER_00]: lose it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I always think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always think about that plant,
man, because it was so unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was just absolutely unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next question is sort of a bit
similar, but a little bit different at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have one specific memory of
cannabis that to you is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: memorable?
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not necessarily be the strongest
weed or anything, but it's just for
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever reason, it's memorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing five year mandatory minimum for
growing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's memorable shit right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years in fucking prison, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of curiosity, when you got released,
and by the way, thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you got released, what was the first
thing you smoked?
[SPEAKER_01]: You must have been thinking about it like,
man, I'm going to puff on this one as soon
[SPEAKER_01]: as I get out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I was really serious when I got
out because I didn't want to go back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't smoke, you know, because I had
to do drug testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on, I got five and five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buried a bus and fucking grew a bunch of
weed in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got tracked, you know, somebody
narked on me because they got popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I got out, I was like,
Oh, I don't want to smoke weed or grow
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be a good boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I was getting drug tested.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I moved and I got a parole
officer who was real cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Hey, man, I'm not going to drug
test you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just fucking smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was game on, you know, started
growing again right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went and got a loan from a friend,
you know, while on parole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started the seed company and it was
growing on parole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bless that parole officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five, five fucking years of dealing
with these fucking trolls and being on
[SPEAKER_00]: parole, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some people I just wanted to
fucking murder, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gosh, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's go to the other end of the
spectrum now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was something that you were excited
to try?
[SPEAKER_01]: People had talked it up to you and then
you finally tried it and you were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, is that it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cuban black haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to ruffle some feathers
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's not, it's not what I
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's just another variant of
NL5 haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have a million of them,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I can only imagine you probably do.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not dissing it in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying that it wasn't what I
expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool, but you know,
like I said, I got all pockets full of
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say I'm going to go drop you off
on a desert Island and you can only take
[SPEAKER_01]: three strains with you to grow for the
rest of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What three are you going to take?
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be either clones or packs of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to do some breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one Mazarbite Giro and NL5 haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You feel like you could probably make most
things from those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the other end of the spectrum,
you're going to drop someone off on this
[SPEAKER_01]: desert Island and you're not a big fan of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe one of these people who's
given you grief over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to leave them with?
[SPEAKER_00]: NL5 haze.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the one?
[SPEAKER_00]: And blue orca haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get to know themselves a little
bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the introspective angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To help you, you know, help your problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there was one person and you could
select alive or dead, who you could have a
[SPEAKER_01]: in-depth conversation with about cannabis,
who would you want to have a sit down chat
[SPEAKER_01]: with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably Neville, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can't really think of anybody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk to his best friend every day and
that's almost the same thing, but it'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting to pick his mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I kind of have the same
thought patterns he did back in 1985,
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as hybridization goes, he was a
breeder and he knew what he was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know what the fuck I'm doing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no method to this madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're on the same path.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way you could say, I'm continuing
his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so is Dwight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both continuing his legacy by
selecting exactly how he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by using his cues and what the
information that he left behind and the
[SPEAKER_00]: information I'm getting from Dwight and
the information that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I would definitely pick Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever NL5 and haze is mentioned,
there's always money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And emotion involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been that way since the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a curse, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So onto our final question for the
interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had a time machine and you could go
back anywhere in history, any place to
[SPEAKER_01]: collect either seeds or clones,
where would you go and what would you
[SPEAKER_01]: collect?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd probably show up in Laguna Beach and
see what those guys had on their
[SPEAKER_00]: surfboards.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1971.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a nice mixture because you
could get access to different things at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this was pre-Soviet war stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only imagine the Afghans they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm like the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke that shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look, I think with that being said,
we're just about at the end of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there any general comments or shout
outs you would like to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, just anybody who supported me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm doing, I'm doing for other people
so that you can experience that as
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you can take to your
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take that through life with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just doing the rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just putting them, putting the pieces
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's up to you to find the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of gold in there,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's what I got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I was here before that fucking
Swami Select motherfucker, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those fuckers tried suing me for my own
fucking logo twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you cannot sue a religious icon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't sue Jesus, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny, I actually that that
came up last night when I was writing
[SPEAKER_01]: questions, their page came up and it's
like we've asked him to change his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you haven't even provided
me with proof that you were the first ones
[SPEAKER_01]: to have the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I provided them with proof that I was
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes ignored.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're capitalists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the real fake Swami, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Swami's book, listen, man,
Swami's were fake to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was something that the Western world
put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, the Swami figure, you know,
the mystical holding onto the crystal ball
[SPEAKER_00]: Swami thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, he paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes people pay to watch him talk to
fucking plants to ask him if they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it's just nutty California,
nutty stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look, I can imagine it's got to be
frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gas can of Stan for taking the time to
come on the show today, for sharing a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole bunch of knowledge and a bunch of
information about your crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really grateful to have had you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the opportunity to let me
say a few things that I kind of needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, too, because, like you said,
man, there's there's a there's a handful
[SPEAKER_00]: of people that follow me around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just disgruntled employees that
like to to slander people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it comes from the forum days
when we had to ban people that behave
[SPEAKER_00]: poorly from ICMAG all the way up through
all the forums that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is just reverberations of poor,
poor taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you have it, my friends.
