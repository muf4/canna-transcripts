[SPEAKER_03]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: A cannabis podcast for bunny enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this episode, we're joined by Jeremy
from Build a Soil to chat all things
[SPEAKER_03]: organic growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So buckle in for some awesome organic
knowledge from the man himself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So first of all, this is the only time
I'll ever do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say this episode is
actually dedicated to someone.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's dedicated to all of the growers out
there who are thinking about maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: switching over, but maybe you use bottled
nutrients at the moment and maybe it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: part of your income or you're just scared
things will fall apart.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, trust me, you know, listen to us and
the world won't come grinding to a halt,
[SPEAKER_04]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_04]: So before we get started, Jeremy,
what's your favorite strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been one of those types of growers
that's been a seed hoarder and always
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to collect something I get easily
excited about crosses that I wasn't able
[SPEAKER_01]: to get and become available or a buddy
that I respect their work made across.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my garden has really been,
I guess, complimented by organics because
[SPEAKER_01]: I can run many different cultivars,
never having grown them before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times they're all able to run
on the same regimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was attractive to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard for me to pick a favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow a different flavor almost every
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of those clone only elites,
there's several of them that are running
[SPEAKER_01]: around out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like the glue has been one of
those very consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if somebody doesn't do a great job
growing it, it comes out smelling very
[SPEAKER_01]: similar and looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a ton of oil on it when you go to
press it or if you're going to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's one that I keep going back
to right now in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one that is very unique came from
Canada and it was a freebie and it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: Jingai cross with a blueberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Jingai was a really sought after
clone only white widow something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the background on it,
but this one in particular, really purple
[SPEAKER_01]: hair and the odor is just unmistakably
candy like and it's really, really stinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping that it translates to taste
and I guess we'll find out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the first big question is why
should people be growing organically over
[SPEAKER_04]: say bottled nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good question for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about congruency in the beginning
before I knew a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was already eating organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was already trying to remove processed
foods and I was being at least starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: be conscious about the carbon footprint
involved in my lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a hypocrite in a lot of those
areas because I'm not perfect,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I choose to make decisions in areas
where I can easily make an impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So started growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And had some success, but when I went to
the grow shop, there was no organic
[SPEAKER_01]: options.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned being congruent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was already living a lifestyle that was
more that method.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I started growing and really
got a little more serious about it in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2009, there was a number of options
available that were organic for the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time, like different bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there was the super soil,
which was by TGA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was, I'm not sure if that had
come out yet or was about to come out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the revs true living organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was like, wow, look at all these
different options.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I started researching more,
I found out that there was actual whole
[SPEAKER_01]: world where people were concerned about
our soil and how it's going to affect our
[SPEAKER_01]: society in the future, how it affects the
nutrient density of the food that we eat
[SPEAKER_01]: and the disease that we can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it started becoming more of just a
translation of that healthy lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I found out how easy it was to
grow organic, how it suited me,
[SPEAKER_01]: my ability to take weekends off and do
things where I wasn't completely revolved
[SPEAKER_01]: around my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also found out that yields
could be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that significantly different to my
experience with hydroponics was that I
[SPEAKER_01]: could get the taste and the smell out of
those genetics the first time I grew them,
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of really trying to figure them
out, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, it was just natural to want
to grow organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like most of our customers
also want to grow organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can get into all the benefits
behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's too many to talk about,
depending on the angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any more specific questions,
I guess, about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, the first thing that comes
to mind is starting Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was that just kind of a natural extension
of that passion?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or was it more of like you saw there was a
niche that needed filling?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd been reading and dabbling a little bit
in Internet businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run a couple of businesses on my own in
the past that were more brick and mortar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was disenchanted with the nine to
five job routine and where I was at in
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a breakup of a relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some things happen in my life where
I was kind of refocused on growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my father passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when that happened, I took a look
at my life and I was like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: geez, I'm going to wake up in 30 years at
the same job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might as well pursue some of these
dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I waiting for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Build A Soil happened because I was
having to source these ingredients that I
[SPEAKER_01]: was reading about on ICMAG and other
organic grow forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was having to source them from all
over the country and all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really hard to get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I went without or waited a while
or I'd get a low grade product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all the money I spent finding out
all this information started to make an
[SPEAKER_01]: impact on some of my local friends and
they'd buy some of the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was kind of a way for me to
buy more for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I thought, well, I'm going to try
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I built Build A Soil and I posted a couple
of Craigslist ads and I had some initial
[SPEAKER_01]: interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, we didn't do any
advertising.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just did word of mouth and it went like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say it was a passion for organics,
but more than that, it was because like I
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned before, I went to the hydro
store and there was no options that were
[SPEAKER_01]: really organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just these kind of predatory
wannabe organic companies with really high
[SPEAKER_01]: profit margins that were selling you
products that were very similar to their
[SPEAKER_01]: current paradigm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it fit their model of keeping you back
in the store all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I started Build A Soil,
it was just a way to share what everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: knew in the organic forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it took them years to find out,
hoping to speed that process up and also
[SPEAKER_01]: hoping to make some money, which it's
working out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really happy about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess moving on to the big question,
which I'm always trying to answer to
[SPEAKER_04]: people, why is bottled nutrients or for
this interview, I'm going to call it
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why is synthetic cannabis different to
organic?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the fundamental factors?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people always say organics better
than synthetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's explain to people what is it
that makes the organic better?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It crosses over a lot of different lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether we're talking about setting up a
grow and making it easy to do versus
[SPEAKER_01]: checking pH and all that stuff,
it can definitely have its advantages.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think most of us that get really
passionate about this, there's a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: je ne sais quoi about the finished product
that has more romance to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a depth of flavor and taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard to explain because,
for instance, I kind of like to think of
[SPEAKER_01]: it culinarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we were going to compare it to food
or to cooking, most of what people are
[SPEAKER_01]: experiencing grown synthetically is akin
to buying a Campbell's soup or maybe like
[SPEAKER_01]: a Wolfgang puck or something a little
higher end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's still a processed, synthetic,
in a can, chelated version, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's ready to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It provides value to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It certainly works the same every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you were to ask a chef who spent
his life visiting farms, tasting
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients from regions, traveling the
world, growing in seasons and putting that
[SPEAKER_01]: in their flavor, it's not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so ultimately in organics,
if we can now grow some of our own inputs,
[SPEAKER_01]: make our own compost, build our own soil,
or have somebody that we trust to do that
[SPEAKER_01]: for us, we start to connect all of the
dots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get those flavors and you get
those nutrient profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that's neat is just
like wine, you find that there's a term
[SPEAKER_01]: called terroir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it relates to the region in which the
wine was grown the temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with tobacco, if you're going to
buy a cigar, the soil is absolutely the
[SPEAKER_01]: most important part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why people seek out Cuban
cigars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking all of that in perspective,
looking at soil as a bigger picture,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, well, geez, how is synthetics
going to add up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all it's trying to do is duplicate
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, it's trying to take
out any of the potential problems when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're monocropping on scale indoors,
which could be bacteria, pathogens,
[SPEAKER_01]: yada yada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like using hand sanitizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: As opposed to just getting in the dirt and
being healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all in all, the organics just fits all
of those different similarities in my life
[SPEAKER_01]: and makes a lot more sense to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people often try to say essentially
that organics is harder than synthetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your general thought on this idea?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there's any truth to that or
maybe people have got a bit confused?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a lot easier, but it is that
is missed on a lot of people because if
[SPEAKER_01]: you go to research organics, you're going
to get a variety of different information
[SPEAKER_01]: that can seem confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's great is a lot of these people that
you find with million different methods
[SPEAKER_01]: are all having success in organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think the difference is in
perception.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go to the grocery store, they're
going to give me a neat little printout
[SPEAKER_01]: with a couple of lines on it that say,
add these ingredients on this day at this
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a beginner, that's really nice to
have a recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like opening up a cookbook and
measuring every single item to put it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you get a little better at this,
you don't need the cookbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's significantly easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: You throw things together and they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be very scary for someone who's
new to this, who has no mentor,
[SPEAKER_01]: who has nobody to hold their hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that it's just kind of a
misconception.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics is so much easier that it's hard
to give a precise recipe where that's very
[SPEAKER_01]: easy in synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just tell people exactly what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, is when people get down the
line in synthetics and they're growing a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of plants, they realize that it's not
that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the manufacturers mislabel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to cut the dosages in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make certain changes to make
things work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't think organics any
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just to where you're going to invest
your time and kind of like switching from
[SPEAKER_01]: skiing to snowboarding or surfing to
bodyboarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just different skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're an advanced expert in one
area, it's going to make you feel kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like a beginner to try organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like the learning curve is a
lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly the ability to lose a crop
in hydro can happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where in organics, I think even a beginner
is going to get to harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, kind of touching on something
you said earlier, in relation to organic
[SPEAKER_04]: food, there's little debate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone would prefer organic food if they
had the choice.
[SPEAKER_04]: So why is it that people go to hydro over
organic as say their first choice?
[SPEAKER_04]: It would seem to me like it would be the
thing people would first want to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of people don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Often you hear people saying, oh,
I did hydro first and now I'm organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know why that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's a system of the
marketing machine that existed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of the magazines that
target a core demographic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of teenagers to early 20s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to the store that's fueled by
repetitive sales with high margins that
[SPEAKER_01]: are on the same products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're not allowed to ask for
help, ask anybody, things are illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you can listen to is the people that
are selling you the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, but it's coupled by a few
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at the history of cannabis,
you can read a few different posts,
[SPEAKER_01]: but DJ Short has a great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's talking about how in the 90s,
there was this perfect storm of hydroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and lights that were available
at stores and coupled by the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: people just figured out how to grow hybrid
plants that grew shorter and had higher
[SPEAKER_01]: yield and worked indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was all a consequence of the war
on drugs going indoors and forcing people
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that at a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have that happening,
you just have a lot of things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: changed in that process and are forced to
have happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's kind of a key difference
there, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here's kind of a bit of a nuts and
bolts question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can organic ever yield more or equal to
synthetic?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the major argument presented by
everybody in the hydroponic industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there's any proof behind
this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think we've moved past those
days where it's just commonly accepted
[SPEAKER_04]: that hydro will always out-yield organic?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, I think we're- Sorry,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a follow-up, if hydro does out-yield
organic, do you think the cost reduction,
[SPEAKER_04]: because often hydroponic weed doesn't go
for as much as organic, do you think the
[SPEAKER_04]: cost reduction in selling price is worth
the cost savings or any potential savings
[SPEAKER_04]: in say yield increase?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's so strange because there's not
enough data on a real large scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking five-year data by real
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is when we're talking farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're looking at agriculture,
there's a lot of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're looking at horticulture,
specifically cannabis, there isn't as much
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know a lot of my friends can claim
some pretty significant yields using
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, we also want to look at
yields 24, 7, 365, including problem
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens, crops that are failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also want to look at energy usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to look at the profit margin,
not just the yield that's produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that when we start to
consider that, I'm finding my greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: customers that are using the sunlight and
supplemental lighting are drastically
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing their profit margin by keeping
the same soil around and learning to soil
[SPEAKER_01]: test, top dress, and amend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all learning right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even me, I'm learning every day about how
to improve these soil mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy because some people will get
hydro that will actually go for a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar amount based on the bag appeal,
just like how you can go to a shop store
[SPEAKER_01]: and get a tomato that looks perfect,
but tastes like nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydroponics can make a beautiful product.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the punch behind that, the power,
the lasting effect, the taste,
[SPEAKER_01]: the flavor, all of those secondary effects
that organics typically has from the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient density.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some of these hydroponic guys are
getting a little better by incorporating
[SPEAKER_01]: organics into their synthetics and
starting to bring some of that back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we're looking at indoor,
duplicating a grow and having someone
[SPEAKER_01]: who's never grown before, hydroponics has
a few legs up on systematizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you get growers that are really
good at their craft and good at organics,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're finding a higher sellable product
like you're finding, because it smells
[SPEAKER_01]: better and looks better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're finding that the profit
margin is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the reports that I'd
encourage people to look at is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: the 30 to 35 year, I believe now,
Rodeale Organic Farms trial stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you'll find is that when they
compare synthetic versus or conventional
[SPEAKER_01]: versus organic, when they compare also
no-till conventional versus no-till
[SPEAKER_01]: organic versus some of these other hybrid
methods, organic just wins across the
[SPEAKER_01]: board every single time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to bumper crop years where
the weather's great, they both are neck
[SPEAKER_01]: and neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to drought years,
organic just crushes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to bushels per acre,
organics is winning when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_01]: price per acre, actual profit margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's less cost in inputs in the
organics and they actually do,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you said, command a higher price at
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're widening the profit margin,
both at the front and the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really appealing because that's
a 30 plus year study on an agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: level, which is where we should be heading
as the laws change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we're going to be forced to
be indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least we'll be in greenhouses as things
loosen up a little bit more and we can get
[SPEAKER_01]: those profit margins there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get more medicine produced,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, maybe this is a bit of a no
brainer, but in the ideal world,
[SPEAKER_04]: would everyone be growing organic in your
ideal world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course, in my ideal world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that there's always like,
for instance, how do you know how good it
[SPEAKER_01]: feels to be healthy unless you've been
sick?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always this yin and yang.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I just saw that the mainstream
majority understood that organic wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: witchcraft and there wasn't something that
will never work, I think I'd be really
[SPEAKER_01]: happy with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people can make their own intelligent
decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly having 5,000 percent markup
on little bottles with liquid in them,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's going to end pretty
quickly as consumers get more educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that will be phased out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next is going to be looking at actual
scale, like, for instance, the hemp farms
[SPEAKER_01]: that we visit out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to recommend 30 percent
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't spend 400 truckloads across an
acre to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've got to start to
[SPEAKER_01]: consider different methods that are going
to create new opportunities for a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: harder to change over for keeping the same
grower and the same mindset.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about that process of
rejuvenating soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have had soil that's been used
for synthetic nutrients for an extended
[SPEAKER_04]: period of time, it's obviously going to
have a large amount of salt built up and
[SPEAKER_04]: virtually no microbes in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be your kind of first guess as
to how to rejuvenate it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you be looking at adding humus
through some means and then trying to get
[SPEAKER_04]: some microbes back in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is it a much more complex process?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this kind of crosses over into,
you know, like how would people,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, reuse some of their cocoa to
make their new soil mix if they're going
[SPEAKER_04]: organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few different ways and it really
depends on your time frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in farming, they call it leaching
instead of flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could certainly do a flushing if
it's just a small amount of cocoa medium
[SPEAKER_01]: and get the salts out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they sell products that are good at
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they sell enzyme products that eat the
salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the agricultural scale, people have
been using the product by Tarragonics,
[SPEAKER_01]: the EM1.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a probiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of one of the originals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has purple non-sulfur bacteria,
lactobacillus and yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can make something that's a part
of that at home on your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these have been proven to
remediate toxic soils and help with salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would do specific research based on
my area, what type of salts I'm dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely there are ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really recommend when people are
considering doing that, if they've got
[SPEAKER_01]: just a small investment in some synthetic
medium, maybe using that out outside in
[SPEAKER_01]: the garden or something and starting from
scratch to start their organic process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not that I think that it's a
hundred percent necessary, but when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to troubleshoot later on,
I hate that there's a variable there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering, is it really some leftover
salts or something that I messed up from
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to recycle this soil that I
probably shouldn't have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to make it just really clear cut
and keep your variables to a minimum,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think starting from a base recipe is
advisable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise flush it with just water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could add some sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how they do it on the agricultural
level and that leeches some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential excess cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could also use some gypsum and that
would replace any of the ones that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: flushing out with calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it's a case by case.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So kind of following that same vein,
what is the best way to increase the
[SPEAKER_04]: general humic content of your soil?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a lot of the times when I see
people and they tell me, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: this soil is depleted.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Often what rings in my head is like,
no, you've just got no humic content in
[SPEAKER_04]: that soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you think that, I guess this
question, it kind of the underlying of it
[SPEAKER_04]: is like no till versus general recycling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Should you be looking to continually just
top dressing your soil with things like
[SPEAKER_04]: compost and eventually the humic content
will kind of leach back in, or should you
[SPEAKER_04]: be looking to full on pull your soil out,
compost it with some rich humic
[SPEAKER_04]: ingredients for a few months and then
bring it back in so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't think that we should
ever be recycling and dumping and
[SPEAKER_01]: reamending and all that, at least from an
idealist perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we were to scale it up, it's got to be
scalable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dumping, reamending is certainly a lot
of labor when you start looking at acreage
[SPEAKER_01]: and greenhouses and anything bigger than,
you know, your own closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at home, if you, I guess the reason
why people do it, as far as starting from
[SPEAKER_01]: scratch each time and throwing all of
their stuff away would be because it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: reset and they can guarantee the starting
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then from there, we started
recycling and it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, we can also do soil testing,
recycling, and that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we started to learn or when I
started to learn more about how plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: nature work, the bio-bibic proportion,
you start to look at all of the compost
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes from the leaves and from all
the stuff on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never mixed in unless it's brought
down by animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, the no-till crowd uses worms and
over time, you continually can lessen your
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs because there's a nutrient cycling
that starts to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the beginning, I would prefer to
top dress it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've got a story out back at my
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some really bad soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very clay out here, really high in
calcerous and alkaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to add a lot of organic matter to
start to get it to work properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was considering tilling down and
doing a ton of work and I decided to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: very affordable truckload of compost that
wasn't even finished yet, more like wood
[SPEAKER_01]: chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brought it in and dumped it down and I
raised the soil up about six inches using
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the areas I wanted to plant
plants, I just put a little potting soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and dug out a couple gallon hole and put
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that first year, everything was
successful, but the second year,
[SPEAKER_01]: it had almost completely turned into soil
and built the soil up instead of digging
[SPEAKER_01]: it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I saved a lot of money and
saved a lot of effort doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then indoors when you're growing or
when you're growing in beds, adding the
[SPEAKER_01]: worms in the container can certainly help
so you don't have to add so much that it
[SPEAKER_01]: adds to the volume of your bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of the biomass that we are taking
out should be added back in and there
[SPEAKER_01]: should be a little extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so whether that's adding a cup of
this, a cup of that as far as dry
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments or adding compost back,
I think those are the easiest way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning when you add it to the top,
there's a lot less risk of it being out of
[SPEAKER_01]: balance and it hurting the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you start to mix it in,
you better be balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why we make a potting soil
that tries to follow the major cations in
[SPEAKER_01]: balance and we're now working on all of
the micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from there, after a cycle or two
without doing a soil test, it seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot easier just to top dress and keep it
just so it has a bigger savings account
[SPEAKER_01]: than it needs and things go really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So would your general philosophy on how to
get the most out of your soil be that
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially you try to maximize the
cationic exchange capacity or not
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you want to have a good balance
between cation exchange capacity and the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go kind of in opposite
directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more clay you get, the more cation
exchange you can have, the more actual
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange sites there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you go the opposite
direction and add a lot more organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, sometimes you lower that a little
bit and you complex a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit harder to read.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to get the most out of the soil,
we want a generous amount of organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to hold moisture and it's going
to have all of those complex organic
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also want to have the cation
exchange in a decent level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've found recently is that our
liming agents can actually artificially
[SPEAKER_01]: increase the cation exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that means is there's calcium
that's free floating around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't been adsorbed into the cation
exchange sites yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soil tests falsely read that as a
higher cation exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just did a soil test recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I got it here in front of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did a Maylick 3 soil test through
Logan Labs and it came in at 32.52 cation
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange capacity or the total exchange
capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to see something, you know,
the 20s or 30s that's really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly we don't want to be below 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more like a field soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we did the ammonium acid 8.2 alkaline
type test on it, it dissolved out a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: that excess calcium and showed us where
our exchange capacity was actually at
[SPEAKER_01]: 18.71.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense because our organic
matter is at 43% on this recipe,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to get that exchange capacity
higher, you could have a little less
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter, maybe add some more clays
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in any case, here's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a really low exchange
capacity, you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement your full season plant with a
lot of input nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if your soil is not quite as
balanced, that might actually benefit you
[SPEAKER_01]: because you'll exhaust through things
faster and you can control it by using
[SPEAKER_01]: teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to use a ton of teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to have a lot higher
exchange capacity and really properly
[SPEAKER_01]: balance these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you have to basically just add
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to get the most out of your soil,
the higher CEC will hold more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that at that point,
the balance of those nutrients is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a little more important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that question for me, it kind of
relates to like super soil versus a coots
[SPEAKER_04]: mix, you know, like on the one hand,
when I look at the super soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, it's like that, that organic heavy
and the, uh, the exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is not as good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas coots is the opposite,
you know, like using what is there more
[SPEAKER_04]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that that should be our
general approach to all organics?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like let's use less amendments and get
more out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when it comes to economies of
scale, we're going to have to learn how to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with the microorganisms that are able
to break these down.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, phosphorus is very immobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always been a problems for farmer and
consequently always been a problem for
[SPEAKER_01]: groundwater too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to bind and lock up and
it's not going to be available where in
[SPEAKER_01]: organics nature finds a way, even at,
you know, pH is that shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're able to exchange differently,
pick up nutrients in different fashions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, when I look at a super soil,
a lot of times there's the margin for
[SPEAKER_01]: error was where you'd hit a hot pocket and
not be able to undo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my opinion is that starting with a
really good balance, you can always add
[SPEAKER_01]: more to it in the areas in which your
environment or genetics or whatever might
[SPEAKER_01]: require that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you start off just tripling and
doubling all the nutrients to try and
[SPEAKER_01]: power it and just really push them hard,
you could end up finding cultivars that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like that or imbalance within the
input recipes that made that batch each
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, it's very hard to
recycle a really hot soil like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you did nail it the first round,
very hard to get it right the second round
[SPEAKER_01]: without throwing it away and starting
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a balanced soil with a known
recipe that people can duplicate allows us
[SPEAKER_01]: to create this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we have to, like I said,
add to it by top dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, that just seems like there's
more power in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more control in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we're trying to get more people to
grow organically, they're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: more success doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if people were growing with super soil
and they're of the opinion that they've
[SPEAKER_04]: now depleted it, do you think it's the
case that there probably is still a fair
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of nutrients in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if say they amended it with maybe some
peat or some cocoa, that might kind of,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, change the exchange capacity a bit to,
uh, you know, you know, to make some of
[SPEAKER_04]: those nutrients more available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think, nah, you should probably
just start over?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it can totally work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, one of the benefits is a lot of
these guys are flushing really hard and it
[SPEAKER_01]: does strip out a lot of their nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not as bad as you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we're worried about sodium
excess, but when I test soils that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, super soils and have,
um, been flushed, uh, at the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's their protocol,
I'm not seeing sodium buildup because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not using liquid nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I typically see is that their
phosphorus and potassium is still just in
[SPEAKER_01]: excess more so than they think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the calcium and magnesium is not
quite supporting, which should be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the more major cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's hard to tell exactly what's
going on when they plant back into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're adding more of the wrong
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I wouldn't know if we took super
soil and did a soil test, we can look at
[SPEAKER_01]: it, balance it pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was just going to shoot from the hip,
I would say cut it in half with some peat
[SPEAKER_01]: and some compost and aeration to make sure
that the texture is right, plant into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you could top dress from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bet you'd work perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll have, it'll have, it'll have excess
P and K and probably a little low calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you cut it in half,
it'll cut that P and K where it needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the top dressing is where you'll
fix the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were a good grower, you could
certainly cut it and then judge on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is your first time you had a good
luck with super soil and you're hoping to
[SPEAKER_01]: use it, you might want to send off for a
soil sample and see where you're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's easy, where I live, it's 25
bucks and you get a really good report.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's also, I can go down to the
local, uh, college extension office and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually get a free soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have those resources,
I totally use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, where you're at, another great person
to talk to would be, uh, Steve Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if he's available for
consulting, but I know that, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: his book, uh, the ideal soil, or I'm
sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mixed the two up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm also thinking of Michael Astera,
the ideal soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Steve Solomon is the intelligent
gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those two really talk about, um,
soil mineral balancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that would be worth looking into
and maybe grabbing a copy of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just going to say, I have to
admit, I actually use blood and bone in my
[SPEAKER_04]: soil mixtures.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's only been recently that I've been
reading more and more about how the,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, the salt levels can start to really
build up.
[SPEAKER_04]: How detrimental do you think it is to use
blood and bone?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and the salt that's in it versus say
another amendment that would say,
[SPEAKER_04]: replace blood and bone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it's because I see that more
and more people are kind of urging us to
[SPEAKER_04]: move away from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm all fine with that, but I was just
wondering, is it actually that detrimental
[SPEAKER_04]: or is it more of like, uh, people don't
agree with the methods in which blood and
[SPEAKER_04]: bone is produced?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's more than methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, I don't think it's that bad
as far as the actual salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could certainly get some batches that
are a little saltier, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking fish bone meal and kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get sodium with those as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we make a proper soil, a lot of
times we could use a little sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I don't think that's really going
to be detrimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have seen soils where that's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I focus on this is like in the
kitchen, if I'm going to use an
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient, I'd like it to be a
multitasker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't need to, I don't need to get
a watermelon cutting knife.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a great knife that'll cut
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I'm going to buy a soil
amendment, I'd like it to be just like in
[SPEAKER_01]: nature, very well balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, seed meals and kelp has every
mineral, um, you know, things that have a
[SPEAKER_01]: good NPK where you look at blood meals,
it's just basically in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just take a step further from
that and you realize that it's basically
[SPEAKER_01]: corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're feeding the cattle corn,
which we shouldn't be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you should be eating grass,
um, Monsanto, GMO, Roundup, sprayed crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: going through the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the worst industries there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's only a few meat packers out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're getting all the blood from
those sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's stamped organic,
which most people, I think if you asked
[SPEAKER_01]: them and they bought organic blood meal,
they would expect that to come from an
[SPEAKER_01]: organic cow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, in an effort to not support
that, I've not sold any of those products
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll, we'll continue to not offer
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then from the perspective of,
let's say they were actually good,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was your cow, it had a great diet and
you got the blood from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be all for using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't really see a downside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's more about the methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, it is a little
one-sided.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is just the N or it is just the P. And
so that is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when you're reading a soil test
and you only need one ingredient,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes the challenge with organics is a
lot of your ingredients comes with
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you read a soil test,
you have to see how each variable is
[SPEAKER_01]: changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for instance, if I need calcium,
but my sulfur is too high, I can't use
[SPEAKER_01]: gypsum because that brings a lot of
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a place for these unitasking
ingredients, but once you get there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it becomes about the source and who it's
supporting, et cetera, et cetera.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we deal with this, I call it the
minefield of organics because you've got
[SPEAKER_04]: all these products, which may be a labeled
organic, but under the hood maybe aren't.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the best example is a lot of
the bottled nutrients, which are stamped
[SPEAKER_04]: with organic yet I have to explain they're
not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, how do you, you know, how do you
straddle this kind of dichotomy of where
[SPEAKER_04]: the chemistry nomenclature already exists
saying that anything with a carbon
[SPEAKER_04]: backbone is organic and therefore some
people will claim that certain synthetics
[SPEAKER_04]: are organic based on that viewpoint while
in the gardening world, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the term organic almost has a completely
different meaning.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, how, how do you deal with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you have to deal with it by getting
educated and setting some core values for
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and keeping that as your focus
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is even in the
organic world, some people would say that
[SPEAKER_01]: gypsum is not organic because it's not a
carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is calcium and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mined mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, if it's dug out of the ground,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps grow plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's always this, um,
duality that exists on both sides of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fence where a very intelligent,
uh, hydroponic grower can explain that
[SPEAKER_01]: organic nutrients are broken down to these
chemistry nutrients at the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: process anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why not just cut the chase?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to me, it always ends up coming
around where I think that if you don't use
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you lose it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're certainly losing our soil and we
haven't been using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's like, if you were to take a
person, put them in an IV diet that was
[SPEAKER_01]: supposedly the perfect nutrition,
I guarantee you they'd lose their teeth,
[SPEAKER_01]: their stomach, all the stuff that was not
processing the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would be very strange, but,
um, equally hard to get that perfect diet
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're just feeding them food.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we'd all agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing your own food and eating
holistically would probably be the best
[SPEAKER_01]: way to live a long life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's just, it's strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: These organic minefield, like you say,
you have to get educated, start asking
[SPEAKER_01]: questions just like when you go to the
store and you start, instead of looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for calories and fat, you start to look,
is this real food or is it fake food?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the organic industry,
you just got to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when you apply that logic,
it becomes easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're like, huh, where's blood
meal come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if it's organic cows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You Google it and you find out it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, with guano, it's a little more
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of organic growers still
using guano.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't really hold them accountable
to some, you know, perfect ideal because
[SPEAKER_01]: my reasons are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want my crew to breathe it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's expensive for what it brings
to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And historically, organically,
when guano was the only nutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: we overmined it and it did cause a lot of
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be a different reason
for a lot of these organic materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want people to kind of lose sleep
over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to kind of pick your area of
comfort and go for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, meaning I know a lot of people that
compost non-organic produce and some
[SPEAKER_01]: people would just think that's insane,
but I trust composting and I know how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: able to rip molecules down to their basic,
you know, building blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each person is going to have a
different answer for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And funnily enough, you kind of hit one of
my later questions on the head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I, um, I use a lot of gypsum in my soil
mix and I cut out a chunk of oyster shell
[SPEAKER_04]: flower and I get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people give me a bit of flack for
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I try to explain to them that like,
even though the gypsum isn't organic,
[SPEAKER_04]: cause as you mentioned, they bring up
where it's not organic and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: yada, yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess in the end, what I'm saying is,
do you think that it's really,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you think it's really worthwhile for
people to go and look into those elements
[SPEAKER_04]: a bit harder so that they can,
as you said, you know, make that
[SPEAKER_04]: distinction between, well, sure,
gypsum is not organic, but I can use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, sure, Epsom salts aren't
organic, but foliar feeding with it isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: going to, you know, kill my plants
overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important for us to all go
through these things on our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times in organic gardening,
it's important to learn these lessons one
[SPEAKER_01]: by one and going through that in our
garden and answering them for ourselves,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's unfortunately one of the
only ways to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's great is if you have a
vegetable garden and a cannabis garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can try a lot of different experience,
experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like you said, with gypsum,
I just don't have any problem with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will, and there's no way you
can convince them otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, to me, I mean, there's a town in
Colorado called gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's laying out there in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's just okay to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we scale up big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much gypsum is there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things people think about,
or they purchase is perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a lot of people don't know is that
perlite is an obsidian rock and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: not an endless supply of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a ton of energy to transform
it from this black rock into like a puffed
[SPEAKER_01]: up piece of popcorn that turns white and
is really white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fluffy and is, it is great
material for gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we don't use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, when you start to look into
organics and you get to deeper levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: it not only becomes, is it organic and
will it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: But how sustainable is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like cocoa core, the argument is,
is more sustainable than peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the peat moss society would argue that
we've only used a very small percentage
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're replanting and yada,
yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas people against coconut will say,
well, they're planting plantations of
[SPEAKER_01]: coconut trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you have to find out, is it organic
or is it synthetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it near the ocean where it's salty?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they shipping it over on an oil
tanker?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just becomes insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the only answer, if you're a purist
is to get back to permaculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: close the loop and have it all coming from
your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to ramp up, you still have to bring in
outside sources, cover crop, organic
[SPEAKER_01]: material, animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there you can start to close
that loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to ask yourself, do I want to
make all my own inputs, close my loop,
[SPEAKER_01]: have my own animals, make my own compost?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or am I okay digging in the ground on
someone else's property to get a few of my
[SPEAKER_01]: resources?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if it came down to
actually producing food for us to eat,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd all be okay using some gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes down to three plants in a
closet, we can afford to have some really
[SPEAKER_01]: high ideals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm okay with that, but applying those
to everybody isn't, I found in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning when you're first learning,
you want to hold everybody, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, there's this organic elitist
thought and people kind of get in this
[SPEAKER_01]: trap where they have to justify their
process by kind of being condescending.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think once you start to learn a lot
more about it, that goes away and you just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of focus on your own garden and
teaching those that are willing to learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I mean, just touching on that
point about the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Australia, for example, cocoa is
readily abundant because, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're close to lots of small islands that
produce a lot of coconuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, peat moss is very, very
expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, five, six times the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes no sense to use peat moss where
you're at, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that was going to be the question
is, are they pretty interchangeable?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not really, I want to say yes,
but I think that they're not 100%
[SPEAKER_01]: interchangeable in the idea that if both
of those were available to you at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: price and they had no environmental impact
and they were just perfect to use,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd still be able to divide that lineup a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so peat moss, typically when we get it
fresh from the bog is going to have fulvic
[SPEAKER_01]: and humic acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have some indigenous
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to have to be washed and
rinsed and sat out for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be a higher cation
exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll hold more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a reason why peat moss is
so widely used and why garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: like greenhouses that have millions on the
line still use it even in the presence of
[SPEAKER_01]: coconut core being viable and rice holes
being viable and all these other options.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that peat moss has a little bit
of a leg up, but if I was forced to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly think I could grow with
coconut core in our soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I was forced to go without both,
I think I could by making a compost that
[SPEAKER_01]: was not quite as nutrient dense and
cutting that with maybe 50% aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there adding my starting
materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could use aged manure that was fairly
devoid of nutrients that's been rinsed
[SPEAKER_01]: out, rained on, and that would be kind of
like peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ultimately, if I didn't have them,
I could do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for you being out there, I probably
would avoid even starting to learn about
[SPEAKER_01]: peat moss as my soil recipe, because it
sounds like it's cost prohibitive and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely going to have a big
environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, that was actually the other
thing I was going to bring up is that,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah, we don't produce a lot of it here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was one of the reasons I'd heard
why it was so expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I lived there, I'd be doing it side by
side just to satisfy my curiosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd import some peat moss and I would
attempt to get my local recipe to match
[SPEAKER_01]: and mirror that and then exceed that,
because my natural curiosity, even if I
[SPEAKER_01]: made the best recipe ever, I would
probably say, dang, but I wonder what if.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can get over that,
I think that you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you really have to try it,
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I would say locally,
just try and work with it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start reading on coconut core,
you'll find a little bit of difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I found, we sent a
recipe off that was half peat moss,
[SPEAKER_01]: half coconut core as the portion of the
base we use that for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soil test came back very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little lower CEC, a little bit different
in a couple of numbers, but it was almost
[SPEAKER_01]: interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say with confidence that as
long as you can balance the calcium and
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium and all that stuff and have a
little bit of thought to the salts that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be in that coconut core and really
wash it, I don't think you'll have any
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for someone who's currently running
synthetics and wants to switch over to
[SPEAKER_04]: organic, what would you suggest is the
best way to convert?
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe not necessarily talking about
like soil mixes quite yet, but if they
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to convert, would you say,
look, just go all out, just switch all
[SPEAKER_04]: hydro, all organic?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or would you say, no, let's just do like
maybe a few buckets organic and get the
[SPEAKER_04]: hang of it and then slowly switch over?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or how would you recommend they switch
from one to the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a tough question.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a large scale agricultural
perspective and from business perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's always advisable to just do a small
test and then go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm always at the thought that when
you stand on the fence and you're in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle, you get shot from both sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really advisable sometimes to
burn your brain, put all your efforts
[SPEAKER_01]: double down and know that's what you're
going to do no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people that are going to
organics, that's their mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to retreat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not gonna do hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not their mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all they wanna do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for people who really don't have a
emotional investment in this, you just
[SPEAKER_01]: say, hey, whatever's better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if it's hydro and synthetic
and has chemicals, or if it's organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to grow what fits my lifestyle
and works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the easiest setup for someone
like that is going to be looking at what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're comparing it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know a lot of the hydro guys can get
just crazy with the number of nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: they get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then their personality is gonna come
into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some guys find organic so easy,
it drives them crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always looking for extra things to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I guess circling back around to your
question about what's the easiest way to
[SPEAKER_01]: start.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two methods that we share at Build
A Soil and one of them for a beginner.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have an earth box, which is
basically a sub-irrigated planter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a plastic growing container that has
the water that's held underneath the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's held up by a tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And above that's just soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant grows in it like normal,
but once it hits the bottom, instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: just hitting the fabric pot, it digs into
a reservoir of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this eliminates the watering factor,
which a lot of times somebody moving over
[SPEAKER_01]: to organics is going to underwater or over
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's gonna be their steepest
learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a great way to mitigate
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, prior to me using earth boxes,
I would have said earth boxes are stupid
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'd never use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only used the fabric grow pots or
plastic grow pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fabric were my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as you use a little bit of
mulch on top and you start to,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes people like in a 15 gallon will
put a tray underneath and you can water
[SPEAKER_01]: from the top and also pour a little water
in the tray to help it wick up and water
[SPEAKER_01]: from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few ways you can take that with
a pretty easy learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a moisture meter that'll allow you
to probe into the soil and find out if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's dry or wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll help a first time grower to
determine if they're over or under
[SPEAKER_01]: watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly what we hear about all the
time when they're going to a big bed of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil to make it easier to get a large
yield, we find the first thing to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem with is how much water to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the rule of thumb on large scale has
always been, what I've always heard from
[SPEAKER_01]: people has said, hey, if you have a
hundred gallon pot, you're gonna add 10
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 10% rule.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a 10 gallon pot, you'll water
a gallon every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that doesn't always translate in
organics because it's gonna be dependent
[SPEAKER_01]: upon your humidity and a lot of other
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the easiest way is either a
fabric grow container or that earth box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my favorite is a large,
large grow bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most people that are willing to just
try out organics don't wanna put a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred gallons of soil in their bedroom
and not have the ability to move it around
[SPEAKER_01]: on a whim.
[SPEAKER_04]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So funnily enough, I got a friend who is
in a similar situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's just switched over to organics and
now he's in, I suspect he's over watered a
[SPEAKER_04]: bit and he's now got a lot of bugs as a
result.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be your recommendations for
someone who's just switched over?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually got a few friends in this
position and they've just switched to
[SPEAKER_04]: organics and because they've been using
some of those hydrobionic principles,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like obviously cocoa absorbs a
lot more water than soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people naturally over water,
I find.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be your advice to them in terms
of getting rid of the bugs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I've got a lot of friends who are
kind of at wit's end trying to deal with
[SPEAKER_04]: these bugs and they, that's kind of the
biggest downside they find coming from
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting to me because when you get
bugs in synthetics, it's game over.
[SPEAKER_01]: In organics, you know, there's a lot that
can happen before it really takes your
[SPEAKER_01]: crop down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's depending on how you look at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, somebody that's used to
visioning a white lab coat in a sterile
[SPEAKER_01]: room is going to have a hard time looking
at soil that has bugs moving around in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the bugs we find in the soil
are beneficial and if they're a fast
[SPEAKER_01]: moving mite, usually it's a soil mite and
they're assisting in that whole ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of times it's just a false
thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, is the plant growing great?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if you've got fungus gnats,
if you've got actual spider mites or
[SPEAKER_01]: russet mites or all these problems we hear
about, those are specific problems that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to need to address.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fungus gnats seems to come up as the
really common pest that doesn't seem to do
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of damage.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's really annoying.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be your recommendation for
getting rid of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really coming up as a problem with a
lot of our customers as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can become a problem in hydroponics and
it can really be detrimental because they
[SPEAKER_01]: eat the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing in rock wool on slabs
and you get fungus gnats, it could
[SPEAKER_01]: decimate your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: In organics, it's more of an annoyance and
it can be very, very annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, it can get into your
flowers and stick there and it could,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hit you in the face when you
open the tent or go to look in your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a few things we can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the least expensive portions of our
grow is the mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of guys are having a really
thick mulch layer with a lot of decaying
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter that fungus gnats love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so until this soil in a no-till system
ramps up to a full ecosystem where there
[SPEAKER_01]: are rove beetles and there are predator
mites and there's all these things
[SPEAKER_01]: happening that balance that, you'll notice
things come in booms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a huge fungus gnats population,
you could just leave it on its own and
[SPEAKER_01]: probably in the next six months to a year,
maybe a few months, it's gonna go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something else is gonna come in and eat it
and it'll all balance out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can't just sit around and wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: It ruins crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can remove our complete mulch layer,
throw out the trash, remove it from the
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will remove a lot of the larva.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then from there, you can sprinkle some
neem cake down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have access to neem,
you can use some insect frass.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have access to that,
you don't have to use any of these
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can create a barrier with the next
step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's to put, I like to use a premium
compost or vermicompost and put about an
[SPEAKER_01]: inch layer up to two inches as a barrier
covering all of the soil that would have
[SPEAKER_01]: previously been infested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something about the beneficial,
the probiotics, the organisms that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: that compost or in that worm castings,
the vermicompost, it smothers them out and
[SPEAKER_01]: it really wipes out a big majority of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're back down into maintenance mode
instead of a huge eradication effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, don't water
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it dry so that the adults can't
immediately lay eggs in the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can put some sticky traps to start
to kill them while you're smothering the
[SPEAKER_01]: larva below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that works really, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I like to do is do all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the exact same time, once I remove the
mulch layer to get the soil really wet so
[SPEAKER_01]: that I can avoid watering the top for a
day or two, I like to get nematodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: predator nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if they're available in
Australia, but we have a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: insectaries out here and I use
Arbicoorganics and we have a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I order one that's specifically for
fungus gnats and you water it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and they eat all the larva and they
really knock them down within the first
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can also get Hypoapsis Miles
Predator mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those should be coming already in your
worm castings if you're getting them
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can certainly buy them and add
them to your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they should do the one-two punch when
you have the nematodes and the mites and
[SPEAKER_01]: you've removed a lot of the larva and the
mulch layer and you got the sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be pretty much eradicated at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a ton of luck with
diatomaceous earth in organics because we
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the mulch layer so moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And diatomaceous earth is not helpful when
it's wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's also why the fungus gnat like
it because it's wet up there in that mulch
[SPEAKER_01]: layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may want to do some bottom watering
and get the top a little bit drier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also, if you do some research,
there's a product called BTI, Bacillus
[SPEAKER_01]: thuringius israelius.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're in a product called Mosquito
Dunks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a common bacteria that they use
and it definitely helps destroy the larva
[SPEAKER_01]: and stop that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using one or all of these techniques
could really help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also hear about people doing some soil
drenches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would ask around and talk to other
organic farmers and maybe look at other
[SPEAKER_01]: products that exist in your market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are all the steps that we take
that seem to have the biggest effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for anyone listening in Australia,
every one of those things is available and
[SPEAKER_04]: I've used most of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They work pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Creating a barrier is a good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll even notice Nat Nix is a
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a recycled glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just put it on top of your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you could probably just use
perlite, but I would prefer, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: compost and all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a previous episode, we had a guest
recommend that we all check in and look at
[SPEAKER_04]: insect frass, as you mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now insect frass, I believe it's available
in Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should be available almost everywhere,
but it's pretty new to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us a bit of a rundown on the benefits
of insect frass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you look at the manufacturers
and what they're advertising, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: them will key back to a chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And chitin is a material that is in
crustacean shells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the insects and their extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the exoskeleton.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also in the cell walls of fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we've learned is that the
enzyme that digests chitin is really
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful and it stimulates the plant's SAR,
or systemic required resistance,
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of like a booster shot gets them
on the defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And besides that, the chitinase can help,
if it's perpetuated and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: chitinase, it can help be a deterrent to
certain pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we use insect frass,
it comes from insects, and not only does
[SPEAKER_01]: it have a kind of like a worm casting-like
effect as far as fertilization,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the poop of insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: The benefit here is the insects are all
eating plant material, and so it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: really organic process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually it's pretty, I guess I
wouldn't say really affordable,
[SPEAKER_01]: but as things start to scale up,
where we're getting it is from mealworm
[SPEAKER_01]: farms and bug farms that are usually meant
for feeding reptiles and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just like worm farming had this
byproduct called worm castings that became
[SPEAKER_01]: popular in gardening, the bug farms are
having a byproduct, and it's called insect
[SPEAKER_01]: frass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is turning out to have multiple
different benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what we're seeing is in any
ecosystem, bugs are gonna be there,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna be eating, they're gonna be
pooping.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna have worms underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna have compost from all the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're now finally mimicking that,
putting all of it into our organic soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, wow, the whole thing is
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's where that real
extra effect is coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've heard a lot about frass recently
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are starting to use it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome, yeah, I've heard it's a good
sustainable amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very sustainable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just kind of going back to a point you
made a little while ago about the kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: the elitivity that exists around organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you think we get around this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because for me personally, I try to be as
non-elitist about it as I can at times.
[SPEAKER_04]: But sometimes it's even just like,
it's hard to get around it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got some friends who grow
synthetically and I just don't wanna smoke
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetic weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nothing against them.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just my kind of personal stance.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you say to someone, hey man,
I don't wanna smoke your weed because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetic without coming across as super
elitist or just in general, you know what
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's a great way to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you go to a buddy's house and
he's gonna microwave some canned soup and
[SPEAKER_01]: cook you up a frozen burger patty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at you as if it's the best thing
that they've ever made before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not gonna wanna look at him and
say, I'm sorry, man, I don't wanna eat
[SPEAKER_01]: this, it's shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, if you're somebody
who has a very specific diet and cares
[SPEAKER_01]: about what you eat, you know all the
chemicals that are in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what went into the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it doesn't taste as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're thinking, the fuck,
can't you see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: A McDonald's burger might sell a lot of
burgers, but it's not the best burger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make a better one, especially if I
had my own cow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew what I ate, processed it myself,
built the fire and cooked it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think the difference just becomes
really when they don't care at all down to
[SPEAKER_01]: personality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just better not to try and
convince them, better not to have that
[SPEAKER_01]: friction in your relationship and just
appreciate them for who they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they start to open up at some
point, maybe you can share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find the number one way to open them up
is to share some of your herb with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're gonna go, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how does that happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beyond that, I feel like it's just a
losing argument.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of people like to talk a lot of
trash about wood chips in soil mixers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like whenever I see a photo and I can
visibly see wood chips, I just know
[SPEAKER_04]: there's gonna be some comment somewhere
about like, oh, you got wood chips in your
[SPEAKER_04]: soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your thoughts on wood chips?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they really the worst thing ever?
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I really read about them is
that they can kind of dive the pH a
[SPEAKER_04]: little.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, wood chips are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I was to improve a property,
putting a mulch layer down of truckloads
[SPEAKER_01]: of wood chips that were from potentially
downed trees that had to be fallen for
[SPEAKER_01]: certain reasons like beetle infestation,
or they were old and rotting and removed
[SPEAKER_01]: from other people's property, chipped up,
instead of making compost, they went to my
[SPEAKER_01]: property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phenomenal results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so highly fungal, really helps
build soil fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that high lignin turns into good humic
and fulvic as a compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think it's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where the fear comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a, I'm gonna say it wrong,
but there's a process called allelopathy
[SPEAKER_01]: where trees will not want to have other
trees competing in their territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they exude and excrete these
chemicals that will not, it will make it
[SPEAKER_01]: harder for things to grow there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the fear has always been that if
you use these particular wood chips,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially from a green waste yard that
has all the different types of trees
[SPEAKER_01]: blended up, you're going to get some
allelopathic wood and it's going to ruin
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only found that to be an issue when
it's mixed into the soil in a high ratio,
[SPEAKER_01]: as opposed to composted first or just top
dressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's top dressed, I don't see any
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a perfectly fine mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's composted, it's a great
material addition to compost that helps
[SPEAKER_01]: provide a low cost, sustainable source of
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, not deforesting, but using
trees that may have been pulled for
[SPEAKER_01]: various reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I guess I haven't heard
as much about the wood in your soil or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that certain places have talked
about bad about municipal compost
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities that are shredding pallets and
then composting that and calling it
[SPEAKER_01]: compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could see kind of the concern there
for the chemicals in the wood and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: nails and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all in all, if I had to chop a tree
down on my property, I think I'd be really
[SPEAKER_01]: excited to use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the listeners should look up a
process called a hugelkultur.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a permaculture principle and it's
based on bearing, rotting wood trunks and
[SPEAKER_01]: stocks underground to eliminate watering
and to build an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really, really has some power.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it seems like within the organic
movement, there's a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_04]: appeal to nature fallacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this question is going to be a bit
extended, but essentially the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: movement around indigenous microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now in Australia, for example,
we've got a very specific environment
[SPEAKER_04]: where we have extremely low phosphorus in
the soil and the microbes have adapted
[SPEAKER_04]: over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as a result, the native plants really
don't actually like to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: phosphorus in the soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so essentially, whenever I see people
going and trying to populate these
[SPEAKER_04]: indigenous microbes, I just think to
myself, well, you're going to be adding
[SPEAKER_04]: them to a medium which is high phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that those microbes can't
handle high phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're just going to get wiped out by
the trich almost instantly if I thought
[SPEAKER_04]: about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that this indigenous microbes
thing is a bit of an appeal to nature
[SPEAKER_04]: fallacy or there is maybe some truth to it
and just it works out in Australia's case
[SPEAKER_04]: that it's not going to work too well for
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the time will tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know enough at all to tell that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that a lot of people are
wanting to use purchased microbes or
[SPEAKER_01]: indigenous microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the research is showing that those
aren't around months later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they are doing is kind of like a
team of soldiers going in and training the
[SPEAKER_01]: locals how to do their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you get some of them die off
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them stay and persist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nature always has this ability to have
all that diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where its benefit is where we
come and slaughter that by using
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetics is where we start to have to
add back and guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you said, indoors with a soil
recipe that's totally different,
[SPEAKER_01]: high phosphorus, I don't really know the
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're indoors, the indigenous microbes
may not be of any benefit other than the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that you could cultivate them for
free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they were really good at actually
solubizing phosphorus because of what they
[SPEAKER_01]: did for the local plants, you might find
benefit in lowering your phosphorus input,
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so knowing that would be beneficial
and might have some effect where just
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing into a high phosphorus recipe,
like you said, that might actually hurt it
[SPEAKER_01]: may just be a waste of your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so more education, more testing is
going to need to be done to say
[SPEAKER_01]: definitively.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've heard from a number of growers
that are using these phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: solubizing products on a super soil with
high phosphorus, they're having a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: issues where growers that are using a
balanced, low phosphorus soil recipe are
[SPEAKER_01]: experiencing really great effects from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just stuff I'm hearing from people,
but it just shows how much more research
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every one of these questions is great
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that nature finds a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I use the mycorrhizae,
when I try and just create a balanced
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus instead of an excess,
I have great results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know like Michael Lester recommends a
lot more phosphorus in our soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: certain growers will want that,
but I haven't necessarily found the need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find that it shuffles that balance
around to other areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ask me again in a year and I might have
a very different answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_04]: So another one, which kind of seems like
maybe it's, I don't know, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_04]: say a fad, but it kind of seems like
splitting hairs to me when we look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: Korean natural farming or the no till
movements in certain regards, like it
[SPEAKER_04]: seems like there's all these names and all
these kinds of ways to individualize your
[SPEAKER_04]: specific style of farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: When in the end, I think we could just use
like this broad term of natural or organic
[SPEAKER_04]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you agree with that, that we should
stop trying to split organic into these
[SPEAKER_04]: subdivisions or you think, oh,
it's just semantics.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that from just learning about it
at all and teaching it, we should not
[SPEAKER_01]: really categorize into which one's better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But learning about these nuances has been
helpful for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that where it becomes a
problem is whether ego gets inserted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's kind of like, oh, I knew about,
you know, before you did, I knew about Joe
[SPEAKER_01]: before you did and I make my own nutrients
and you don't, therefore I'm better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the different segments to me are like
specialization with an educational field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you go to school, you can
specialize deeper and narrower within a
[SPEAKER_01]: niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like as long as they're all
working, we can maybe mine some valuable
[SPEAKER_01]: information from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is, for instance,
the Korean Natural Farming's latest
[SPEAKER_01]: extension is Jadam Natural Farming,
Cho's son, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we start to look at that and the
difference between Cho is Cho uses a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of molasses, which is imported,
not grown there and is expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas Jadam uses leaf mold harvested
with indigenous microorganisms and is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be fermented on the site where
the plants are grown at that temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to them, it's like, why would we do
this different?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to import a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from the outside in, their favorite
thing to make that's very important to a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of these recipes and foliar is called
the Jadam wetting agent, which involves
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing in potassium hydroxide from
within the farm and making your own soap
[SPEAKER_01]: at a low cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, I'm like, well,
yucca is easier for me to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great wetting agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got saponin as a great fungicide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use that because it's just as
cheap and I don't want to make my own
[SPEAKER_01]: wetting agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can, instead of learn about,
I guess embrace our differences and learn
[SPEAKER_01]: why they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then each person individually figure
out whether that should be applied to them
[SPEAKER_01]: or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the best way, but because we
don't all have unlimited time to research
[SPEAKER_01]: all the methods, we ended up just kind of
asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I think a lot of us get
shut down is, you know, you'll ask,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, is this way better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing this for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all I think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the only way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most people that are honest will say
that they all work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of where you live,
what region, where in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to have a different answer
for a lot of these situations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess kind of another one that might
be a little bit of semantics, but how do
[SPEAKER_04]: you feel about exotic ingredients?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, recently we've seen the rise of,
I hope I say right, the Shilajit.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you feel about these types of
ingredients?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think on the most part,
there's probably something that you can do
[SPEAKER_04]: its job reasonably cheaper, or do you
think some of these kind of exotic
[SPEAKER_04]: ingredients do have a spot in the garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because a lot of us are wanting to
experiment at the highest level with all
[SPEAKER_01]: these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be reading about all these
things that work for human health,
[SPEAKER_01]: like Shilajit, and you're going to be
reading about Ormis and different things
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can make.
[SPEAKER_01]: But without a doubt, I've never found
anything that just doubles my yield or
[SPEAKER_01]: just makes everything so incredibly
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of them, like, you know,
good compost, some kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost tea certainly was one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that really worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a few things that just make
a huge difference, but some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things, I'm just not sure are worth the
cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just purely looking at them,
are they, do they do something?
[SPEAKER_01]: But versus their return on investment,
a lot of times don't pan out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you don't see essential oils
used on big farms because it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd have to grow a billion acres of
plants just to make the essential oils to
[SPEAKER_01]: turn around and put it on all our crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for an indoor garden or essential oils
can work really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess, I guess there's value,
but everybody's going to have to ask,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most value comes when you're
really researching this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find if somebody just gives me something
and I try it, for some reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not the same as me reading,
romancing, learning about every effect
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to have, and then seeing if I
see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something about that law of attraction,
the power of thought, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some products that'll definitely
have that fake, that effect, that placebo
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so weeding that out, I think is
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a number of products will come back on
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a cycle that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, fulvics, a lot of times get
popular and then they go out because so
[SPEAKER_01]: many fake fulvic companies come on the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: People realize it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they go by the wayside and then
the real companies stick around and people
[SPEAKER_01]: start using it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets popular and then it goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's always going to depend on the
quality of these inputs as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of snake oil salesmen will key in on
that later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so just touching on how you said
that one ingredient you had noticed a big
[SPEAKER_04]: improvement from was like quality compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you of the opinion that really high
quality worm castings, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: vermicompost is the best compost or do you
feel that there's another compost which
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe is a bit better?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good for different purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worm castings will have the most nutrient
density typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here's the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thermophilic compost will go to
temperature to make it so that it's viable
[SPEAKER_01]: for use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's done over a really long period
of time, it'll have really good balance of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and pH and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost isn't going to have a lot of
minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so mineralizing that compost is always
going to be important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you mineralize compost,
feed it to worms, add extras like kelp
[SPEAKER_01]: meal and things like that, it's not going
to go to temperature again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worms will work it through bacterial
action and fungal action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to keep a lot of the
secondary benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might be available in these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people that are looking for the
hormones, the metabolites, the secondary,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, properties of compost,
worm castings is where it's at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why everybody uses both.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're learning from a scalability
perspective is that following these
[SPEAKER_01]: recipes is not affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it would make more sense to make
your own castings and use those for side
[SPEAKER_01]: dressing, top dressing and teas,
and then focus on your main soil to be
[SPEAKER_01]: built on other materials like compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I was actually going to ask,
would you recommend, yeah, doing the
[SPEAKER_04]: opposite of what you said, whereby maybe
using a slightly reduced quality compost
[SPEAKER_04]: in the bucket, but top dressing with a
high quality compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause something I'd always heard was that
a huge benefit of top dressing with say
[SPEAKER_04]: vermi compost was, you know, the leaching
of the microbes down into the root ball.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that could kind of improve the
compost down there if it wasn't quite as
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you say you didn't have the money to
buy a lot of worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And worms always do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you go to a local spot,
they may not have the carbon to nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio proper, which means that the off
gassing of methane and nitrogen gases will
[SPEAKER_01]: be high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to have as much nutrients
where when I test castings, it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: really high in nitrogen, really high in
potassium, really high in phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we're seeing those effects,
even if the microbes aren't fully intact
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a little older.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, worm castings are significantly
more potent and that's why their money is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that's why it's more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But contrary to that, they can also be a
little too potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you base it on a lot of our
recipes at 30% compost and you get a
[SPEAKER_01]: really potent vermicompost, you might have
some problems of excess nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: excess potassium, excess phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we ran into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why is about 90% of the,
of the worm castings on the market in the
[SPEAKER_01]: United States, just throwing a number out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotta be upwards of that percentage
are made by UNCO and they're a processor
[SPEAKER_01]: that basically makes a product that's
devoid of nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can grow in a hundred percent
UNCO worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that with homemade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the reasons why is if you start
feeding a sedreed peat in a bucket with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of grain to a worm,
that process, the weight of input material
[SPEAKER_01]: is the weight of castings they get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: With our castings, when we have a regular
farm doing it, they put about eight pounds
[SPEAKER_01]: of feed in to get two pounds of castings
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those other six pounds are for the worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it's just a big difference in
nutrient density.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to use a lot of times
around that 10 to 15% mark to hit that
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, um, I guess the question would
then be is, um, if you are going to make
[SPEAKER_04]: your own worm castings, what would you
recommend is the best way to do it?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've read some stuff which says,
um, you know, you should use, if you want
[SPEAKER_04]: to go for those really nutrient dense
castings, as you spoke about, maybe use a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of manure as your base instead of
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what are your recommendations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you wanted to make a material that,
that, that when composting, composting
[SPEAKER_01]: was, uh, very low CEC, very, you know,
not nutrient rich, that actually might
[SPEAKER_01]: serve a purpose as a base, kind of like
peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it would certainly be high in
bacterial and it would be a good material
[SPEAKER_01]: to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you start thinking about making a
really nutrient dense top dressing and tea
[SPEAKER_01]: quality vermicompost, we're going to,
you know, relate that to the quality of
[SPEAKER_01]: our inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best would be to start with a
thermophilic compost as the starting
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would remove all those seeds and all
the problems that happen from just,
[SPEAKER_01]: just recycling waste, like throwing your
tomatoes right in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have some tomato seeds pop up
because it's not going to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: fully composted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you make a thermophilic compost and you
get the carbons and nitrogens and greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there to make it even
better, a lot of people will focus on
[SPEAKER_01]: using really nutrient rich plants to make
their compost like metal and comfrey and
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the plants that are already revered
in gardening because they are able to draw
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients from deep within the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you use those along with some straw or
whatever browns you find that are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you make a compost that by itself
would be phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you feed that to worms with a few
extra benefits like kelp and things after
[SPEAKER_01]: the compost has gone to temperature and
cooled back down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That to me makes the most nutrient dense
compost or vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the compost that we're, the worm
castings we're currently using are from a
[SPEAKER_01]: facility that does use manure and they are
incredibly nutrient dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so just touching on some cover crops,
like you just mentioned there with the
[SPEAKER_04]: nettle and the comfrey, do you think that
having a cover crop like those or
[SPEAKER_04]: something like clove or just any of these
nitrogen depositing companion plants,
[SPEAKER_04]: do you think that they outweigh the
benefits of say having a nice big top
[SPEAKER_04]: dressing layer of compost and,
you know, like if you had to pick one or
[SPEAKER_04]: the other, which one would you choose
essentially?
[SPEAKER_01]: From indoor perspective, probably just top
dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the there's a number of benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a facility that's multiple tens of
thousands of square feet indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of doing big beds,
they ended up doing I think 20 or 30
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon containers on rolling tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for them, the little bit of clover
that they're growing in there acts as a
[SPEAKER_01]: binder to the soil and keeps the entire
soil mass intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they're hand watering,
it doesn't shift the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for them, that was really
imperative that they had that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they feel like it also is feeding
those exudes to the soil and keeping the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people will tell you that
that's just totally imperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree, but picking one or the other,
I think that you'd have a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient power command on the spot by just
top dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I'll run the top living mulch
and then I'll just top dress right over
[SPEAKER_01]: the top and smother it so you get a little
bit of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the field, when we have time
as our benefit, we can harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can sow cover crop after harvest,
let that grow up and then we can smother
[SPEAKER_01]: that through winter and then we can till
it back under or top dress over it and get
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the benefits from the free nitrogen
that's taken out of the air, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: the top dress where the way most people
are using cover crop indoors, it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: really fixing nitrogen and big nodules and
putting it deep into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more once that cover crop dies and
returns to the soil that it's adding its
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if people could grow one plant maybe
outside or around that's going to help out
[SPEAKER_04]: with the growth of cannabis, what would be
the one plant you recommend they grow
[SPEAKER_04]: alongside it, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, it's aloe vera because it's got
a lot of good purposes in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, aloe vera would probably be the one
I'd recommend because most of the plants I
[SPEAKER_01]: grow have to have some benefit,
whether it's beautiful or whether it
[SPEAKER_01]: produces food or aloe vera just has a ton
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look it up, it has all the amino
acids, it has the salicylic acid for
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting, it has benefits as far as saponin
and wetting agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use it for burns and it's a great
plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy to grow is the other key
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You almost can't mess it up if you get the
right type of aloe and if it's got a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of sun, you can water and lots of
nutrients in the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just almost not water it,
it'll stay alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you practically kill it, you can bring
it back to life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beside that, comfrey is another really
popular one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is comfrey can be invasive and
take over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they found that the bocking four,
bocking 14 are a very popular cutting of
[SPEAKER_01]: comfrey that doesn't develop seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sterile and that one in particular
has a good carbon to nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you cut the leaves off and top
dress with them or make compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: they turn to compost very, very quickly
and they have some secondary benefits that
[SPEAKER_01]: are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good to have on the farm too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nickname for it is knit bone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps heal broken bones and you can
make a poultice with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the soil, it has a lot of potassium and
it'll have a good rounding of other
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those two, the aloe and the comfrey
would be great to grow and very easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, when I found a coots mix and
admittedly it was through your site,
[SPEAKER_04]: it was a pretty big game changer for me in
terms of the results I was getting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, as you've kind of alluded to a
few times, when I went to upscale this,
[SPEAKER_04]: the worm castings became a bit cost
prohibitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you find that there is fairly similar
results from using, because I find that
[SPEAKER_04]: you can get pretty high quality general
compost and it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that from using say a good
quality compost as opposed to the
[SPEAKER_04]: castings, you can get a fairly comparable
result?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, I think so as long as it's good
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've actually switched our recipes to
exclude the vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really keeping us to the point
where we had no profit margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We couldn't get it to a store to resell it
because they couldn't afford to ship it
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the castings was the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's 15 to 20 grand just for a
truckload of castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you start burning through them,
it can cause a really big problem for
[SPEAKER_01]: cashflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the inconsistencies that would
come from having to source that much when
[SPEAKER_01]: people just don't make that much where
compost they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a really good reason for
composting and people are already doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: at scale and they understand it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you find compost facilities that
have really good compost tests and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: learn to interpret those, find the pH,
look at the carbon to nitrogen ratio,
[SPEAKER_01]: look at the salt levels, you can pretty
easily make a great soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, make your own dang
castings for free, put worms right in your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will turn that compost into castings
for you while your plant grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of that, you can take that
worm castings out of your bin and top
[SPEAKER_01]: dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get all the benefits without all the
expense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you really are just starting,
you can buy a small amount of local
[SPEAKER_01]: castings and use those for teas and really
stretch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all in all, I'm starting to get off the
high horse of castings are bust and start
[SPEAKER_01]: to say that, hey, good compost is probably
a lot more important and making your own
[SPEAKER_01]: castings will be the big price difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you were going to recommend to like
say a good friend, a soil mix and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: just starting out, would you give them
coots mix or would you give them maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: something else?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like what would your recommendations for
someone who's just looking to get into
[SPEAKER_04]: organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just coots mix or for instance,
if those ingredients might be hard to find
[SPEAKER_01]: and it would keep them from taking action,
I would say just mix up a recipe of three
[SPEAKER_01]: parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: One part, you know, peat moss or coconut
core or whatever that type of medium that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure it's good and rinsed and it's a
good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: If peat moss over, you know, we're not
going to rinse it, but with cocoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why I say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next part would be your aeration
perlite, pumice, lava rock, something to
[SPEAKER_01]: add some air holding capacity in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the third component would be the
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, you pretty much have a
good soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're using peat moss,
it's a little acidic and the numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't quite right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we add a little bit more calcium to it
via oyster shell flour or gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would still recommend those normal
numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, if you didn't have
like the crustacean meal, the neem and the
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp that is part of the coots mix,
I would say go grab a tomato fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: that's organic you like, follow the
recipe, put it in your soil and use that
[SPEAKER_01]: as your first grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll crush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, you'll experience some
benefits by getting some really high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality amendments and starting to learn
about each of them individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But tomatoes are similar, fast growing
annual or biennial plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of treated as an annual.
[SPEAKER_01]: So similar nutrient requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think most people are aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out here, there's a number of tomato
fertilizers you can buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Problem for me was I'd pick up that box
and I'd read cottonseed meal and realize
[SPEAKER_01]: that's GMO, number one pesticide spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one is there's feather meal,
big chicken farms, all GMO corn fed and
[SPEAKER_01]: hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you find right away that all of the
fertilizers are usually just someone's
[SPEAKER_01]: waste sold at a huge profit margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we end up going to these
specific recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly, if you're already doing
synthetic, going down the street,
[SPEAKER_01]: buying the tomato fertilizer, mixing the
three parts together, I think you'll have
[SPEAKER_01]: good success.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just specifically, I found it almost
impossible to find crustacean meal in
[SPEAKER_04]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for that one amendment, what would
you recommend as like a good
[SPEAKER_04]: interchangeable?
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're mainly after the calcium carbonate
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just a natural source of
calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a oyster shell flour,
great, you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need the crustacean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that it does bring to the
table, though, is a little bit of meat
[SPEAKER_01]: that might have been in there,
so a little nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might also bring to the table the
chitin, which you know we talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: previously that's available in insect
grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even then, if you didn't have it,
I don't think it's totally imperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you could just get away by using a
lime, which is calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have an agricultural lime,
it's going to be mostly calcium and about
[SPEAKER_01]: 4% magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a dolomite, it's going to be
higher magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the kicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: The magnesium is not the water-soluble
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: The calcium is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're mostly going to get calcium
from that anyways until a few years down
[SPEAKER_01]: the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't worry terribly about the
crustacean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of those that's a little more
easily replaceable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would use insect frass as a direct
replacement if that's available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so for people like the Rev,
he often advocates that dolomite lime is
[SPEAKER_04]: quite good in your soil mixes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I remember the first post I ever read
on Builder Soil was essentially a link.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was dissecting through the super
soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was really impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the biggest thing I always remember
about that article is that you were fairly
[SPEAKER_04]: adamant that you don't really need
dolomite in your soil mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just forms these little anaerobic
pockets.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not even really doing what a lot
of people think it's doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you mind maybe explaining this a
little better?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you still stand by that philosophy
of don't really need dolomite?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I still stand by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's as detrimental as I
maybe previously thought when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: getting educated on the subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people that use it, and it's not
ruining their soil by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of those people aren't keeping it
around for years at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may not be hardening up,
but the wicking and the moisture holding
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity may not be as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's certainly been proven on an
agricultural scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I started to do is instead of
making up my own opinion and just going by
[SPEAKER_01]: what I saw 100%, I started researching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And across the board, at the forefront of
soil remineralization and soil testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: application, they're not using dolomite
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is very cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the calcium to magnesium ratio that
we're looking for is not present in
[SPEAKER_01]: dolomite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so over time, it will affect itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you're just liming peat moss,
it's very cheap, it's available,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're keeping our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in an effort to avoid that,
I still hold true that you don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: dolomite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather see magnesium added
separately, calcium added separately,
[SPEAKER_01]: and have more control over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather see oyster shell flour,
which is more natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason why it's fed to every
chicken as a premium source of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of that, I'd also rather
see maybe gypsum that brings the sulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so much more beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that's all you have, looking back on
my previous posts, I don't think that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would maybe beat it up as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly if you're going to be the
one teaching everybody about building soil
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, that's not the go-to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still believe that using an ag lime,
using oyster shell, using gypsum,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of the others is going to be
better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got some people, like the Rev,
who advocate using some of these really
[SPEAKER_04]: long-term amendments, like green sand,
and as you mentioned, just their dolomite.
[SPEAKER_04]: The magnesium can take years to become
available.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that advocating the use of
such long-lasting or slow-release
[SPEAKER_04]: amendments is a good thing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because from my experience,
as much as we all try to reuse our soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: things often happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can't really guarantee that everyone
would have the same soil in three years
[SPEAKER_04]: from now, such that they're really getting
all the uses out of those long-term
[SPEAKER_04]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel the same way?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think, nah, you should just hang
onto your soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think you should hang onto your
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're one that can plant it that
far ahead, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think any of us really can
that accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a number of people that grew up
in Jersey tell me, man, I wouldn't buy
[SPEAKER_01]: anything from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that being said, it's my other point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was a big kick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a fad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a huge market that was
talking about potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And green sand had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that you should use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm of a big believer that some of
these things that might be a long-term
[SPEAKER_01]: breakdown in a very, very active microbial
living soil might actually break down
[SPEAKER_01]: faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we're going to learn more about that
in the future and double back on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't like to get a rock dust that's
just potassium or just one direction and,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you said, is proven to take a number
of years to break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's a bad use of the space
in that container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather add an ingredient that's
going to have more power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's just kind of how I look at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather use basalt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got the paramagnetic energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got all of the micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a number of other ways to get
potassium, for instance, from compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that we need such a slow
release form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely don't believe in green
sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a number of other ingredients
that I'm surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a local buddy of mine that
got basalt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of getting the rock dust,
he got gravel of basalt, a larger chunk of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said after two years, it was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's using a lot of microbes in his
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm thinking maybe it's not about
just the minerals, but maybe the coenzyme
[SPEAKER_01]: factor, the energy effect of just having
those minerals there and the ability for
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes to play off that energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know if there's a Discovery Channel show
you can watch that's about the formulation
[SPEAKER_01]: of the earth, and it talks about basalt
and how the first organic substances were
[SPEAKER_01]: created at really high temperatures and it
was something to do with the energy of the
[SPEAKER_01]: rock and all the minerals there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was this amino black substance
organic lifelike created for the first
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously that's not something they're
teaching in school and it's not like
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly, they're just talking generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's exciting enough to consider that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe there's a possibility green sand
has some of that benefit, but I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: more of it was a marketing ploy based on
the fact that at that time people knew
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium was important and they had a
mine full of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've moved away from that and I
don't see it as popular anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just staying on that topic of basalt,
it's actually one that's a little more
[SPEAKER_04]: tricky to find in Australia, as well as
things like glacial rock dust.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be your recommendation for
alternatives to these ones?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is regular rock dust a good replacement to
glacial rock dust?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have granite or what do you have
out there that might work?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got rock dust, but I've found basalt
is a little harder to find and I've never
[SPEAKER_04]: seen glacial rock dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think rock dust would be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you look at rock dust and all of
a sudden you start to see like aluminum
[SPEAKER_01]: and you think, oh my God, I got to stay
away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of these aluminum silicate,
aluminum iron silicates, they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: locked in this complex where most of the
micronutrients are the coenzymes that's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually having an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you read a book that's free,
it's available on the internet called
[SPEAKER_01]: Bread from Stones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started with granite and had a really
good effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like in the United States,
if you're towards the East coast,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably go granite.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the West coast, probably
volcanic or glacial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so here in Colorado, we're blessed
with the, where I live down the street,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a mesa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the Grand Mesa, one of the
largest flat top mountains in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States, maybe even the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few hundred lakes are on top of it and
it's completely encapsulated by basalt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it's just a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just go right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get basalt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got all the benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being talked about right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got all the energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, if I didn't have it and
granite was right there, I'd probably use
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would look at what's locally
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times you can go down to a gravel
production area and just get some rock
[SPEAKER_01]: dust for free as their waste product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the 400 mesh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the powder they just can't do
anything with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can use that as a rock dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really wanted to, you can send it
off to a lab and get it tested and see if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's anything toxic in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, if you go to
remineralize.org, they really just talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about using whatever rock dust is locally
available and it having a remineralization
[SPEAKER_01]: effect on the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm still trying to learn about
that, but for a while we used the glacial
[SPEAKER_01]: rock dust and now I'm really sticking with
basalt and it makes a great texture in our
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I'm at right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you're looking at just a
general soil or maybe more specifically a
[SPEAKER_04]: compost, do you think that like black is
better?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's the aim for a really nice
humic rich soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be looking to get it nice and
dark or not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in rock dust, a lot of times we
go there as we look at the earth's ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to remineralize itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in volcanic regions where that's
happened through lava, we see a really
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in the nutrient density of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we look at that and from the lava
flow to a high canopy rainforest,
[SPEAKER_01]: we find that there's a lot of microbes
involved in the beginning processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we look at compost,
now we're not looking at minerals,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're looking at organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to get the humics and fulvics,
a lot of premium compost like our Ollie
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain fish compost is broken down with
hard wood and stuff that takes years to
[SPEAKER_01]: make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does turn dark black.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, if you took a manure
compost and it was dark black,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd think that, and it was made in a few
months, I'm guessing it got way too hot
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was full of way too many
thermophiles and it just turned black.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were to take a hundred percent
grass clippings from your front yard,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll turn death black and smell nasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that black is not a premium compost,
but it certainly turned black.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would always be asking you how it was
made.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do you feel about using Bokashi as
a soil amendment?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've seen it come up a lot lately,
but to me it kind of was initially ringing
[SPEAKER_04]: some alarm bells, like the idea of like,
cause Bokashi obviously wants an anaerobic
[SPEAKER_04]: environment, but in your soil you want an
aerobic environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how does that kind of work?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they not working against each other in
a way?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to think that they were working
against each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was scared of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I saw people growing completely
anaerobically with great success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, shit, this nature has more
than one way to do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you look at JDOM farming and
their key tenant is that if it smells,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we need to get over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to throw up shit and blood and
sticky stuff all over our farms and it
[SPEAKER_01]: worked great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you look at other cultures
too, like some of the Asian cultures
[SPEAKER_01]: farming for 10,000 plus years without
having any issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden they adopt Western
philosophies and they got major problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, have you ever heard anyone
who had looked into or toyed with the idea
[SPEAKER_04]: of creating cannabis from humanure?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've even talked to a couple of people
that are in the out back there and they
[SPEAKER_01]: live and they've had composting toilets
and they're more comfortable with the
[SPEAKER_01]: process and their diet is good and they've
been growing their own in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having that as a day to day conversation
with customers and talking about peeing
[SPEAKER_01]: for fertilizer and diluting with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of our diets aren't there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not totally comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a permaculture perspective,
it makes sense to close the loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you could successfully do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the only way I would do that
was making a product that was then used
[SPEAKER_01]: and turned into compost and then it grew
another crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that crop was used to make the
compost that I actually used.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have a couple of layers between me
and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're looking at Bokashi,
there's a couple of different methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, we talked about off
gassing that happens when composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's done properly, there really
shouldn't be a lot, but it does take time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're finding in tests that people can
Bokashi compost significantly faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I try not to say one's better
than the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm Bokashi composting, it could be a
tool where in my kitchen when I used to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it more often, it was because it was
winter, it's snowing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a thermo compost pile going
and I have some food scraps I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: recycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I opened the bucket, I put the Bokashi
in and I use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most people aren't using the Bokashi
compost or the Bokashi product as the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that could go get buried in your
yard or processed through the worms or fed
[SPEAKER_01]: to the compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about using the actual
Bokashi as a fertilizer and it does have a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good NPK, so it can act as a
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The indigenous microbes that are,
or the microbes that are on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Lactobacillus and things,
they're actually facultive anaerobes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't have to have an aerobic
environment to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the lactic acid is certainly being a
good decomposer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So adding that in, depending on who you're
talking to, if they might be making a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: from scratch and you want to out compete,
a lot of times mixing it into a soil could
[SPEAKER_01]: be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've not seen them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A problem from doing it when it's in the
proper proportion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally don't mix it into my soil
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would use it only as a top dressing or I
would use it for my Bokashi compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people are using it for teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if anything, what's exciting is
that people are finding benefit to it and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's working even in the face of the fact
that a few years ago I would have said
[SPEAKER_01]: anaerobic is going to kill it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm just enamored that it's like
the complete opposite of what we said
[SPEAKER_01]: actually still works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm just trying to learn from that
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've found is that fermenting
some of your own fertilizers works pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Bokashi has a place, but it's not like
a make or break must have item in my book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the relationships that I've
created with people that like Bokashi keep
[SPEAKER_01]: me talking about it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, if I absolutely had
to have a few things, it would just be
[SPEAKER_01]: some soil and some compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think Bokashi would be the number
one item on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if someone was looking to get their own
compost pile started, whether it be
[SPEAKER_04]: through Bokashi or other means,
would you recommend that, or not
[SPEAKER_04]: recommend, but do you think that you could
use Bokashi to kind of kickstart a compost
[SPEAKER_04]: pile?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like my friend's got this big compost pile
and it's not that thermophilic,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it is quite anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tell him like, you should consider
throwing some Bokashi in the middle of
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it might really kickstart things.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that's the case or probably
not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it probably would, but I don't
know if it's just gonna be from,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you were to just throw some grain in
the pile, it might be enough extra kick
[SPEAKER_01]: and nitrogen or whatever is required from
the seeds to kickstart that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go buy a product at the store
called compost starter, you'll flip up in
[SPEAKER_01]: the back and realize it's alfalfa meal,
crustacean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just some nitrogen having materials
in it and that helps kickstart the
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they'll have a little bacteria
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's neat is that there is bacteria
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a lot of times what's
considered a starter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it'd be a great place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't work, it's not gonna hurt
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, most of the people that
are doing thermophilic compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not including Bokashi in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're keeping them separate.
[SPEAKER_01]: On my property, I'll dump the Bokashi
right in my thermocompost, but I still
[SPEAKER_01]: consider it a thermocompost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not Bokashi-ing in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're separate from each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if someone did want to say start
their own compost pile, whether it be,
[SPEAKER_04]: quote, cooking their soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just for anyone who's not aware,
I'm pretty sure everyone is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But whenever someone like Subcool says
cooking soil, they really just mean
[SPEAKER_04]: composting.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if someone was to start their own
compost pile and make either the Coots mix
[SPEAKER_04]: or the Super Soil, how long would you
recommend composting it for?
[SPEAKER_04]: And would you recommend turning it
regularly?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mix it and plant directly into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting very small amounts of
inputs, premium compost, where most of our
[SPEAKER_01]: initial nutrients are coming from,
peat moss and aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to cook it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make a Super Soil and you add
tons of nutrients out of proportion that
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be kind of homogenized,
is the word I like to use in the mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes a ton of sense to moisten it and
to let it sit and to turn it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why is the inside of the
pile is going to get hot and the outside
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to stay cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you turn it, it puts the cool part
back into the inside and makes sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all homogenized evenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once it cools back down, you know that
it's not going to go thermal and burn your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there was an excess in some
nutrients that needed to be released by
[SPEAKER_01]: the bacteria, that process has now
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we get above 200 gallons per
container, even in a Coots mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to let it sit at least a week or
two and see what the temperatures look
[SPEAKER_01]: like because even a basic recipe can go
thermal if it's in enough volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why making your own compost at home
is typically a minimum three by three by
[SPEAKER_01]: three pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another reason why Bokashi is popular is
because most people don't have enough
[SPEAKER_01]: waste to make a three by three by three
pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they end up doing cold composting
that takes years or a tumbler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not as good as thermocompost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then they have seed sprouting and
they have flies in it and larva and bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everybody's going to determine
what's most important for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just growing vegetables out in
the field or if you're throwing it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: lawn, it could be cold compost,
it could be Bokashi, it could be anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's going in your prized plant that's
actual medicine for a disease you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to fight in your one indoor grow
that you're paying electricity for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might get a lot more specific about
what's going in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on a question that's maybe a little
left of field, have you ever heard from
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe a customer or just friends that
using certain amendments is able to really
[SPEAKER_04]: alter the properties of the cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, more so than just say like if
it was deficient, then then you give it a
[SPEAKER_04]: suitable environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously it's going to come out
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like the specific example I've been
told of is I know someone and they grow
[SPEAKER_04]: these really skunky strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said that when they use more
sulfur amendments in their soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: it can really make those skunky smells
come out because they're typically
[SPEAKER_04]: characterized by those thiol sulfur
groups.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there's any truth in this or
maybe it's just a bit anecdotal?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think it's totally true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we need to look at is the
building blocks and where we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes, terpenoids that have our
flavors, we're talking carbon and hydrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: or carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you look at what goes into the
building blocks of that and you start to
[SPEAKER_01]: find that sulfur is actually a big part of
that creation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you go, oh, wow, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just that sulfur is aromatic,
but it actually might be a key part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: process of these secondary components that
actually provide that smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've noticed is that that's that
taste to smell translation too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's two components, complex
organics bring that and the sulfur brings
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having both, I think, gives them both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a while in hydro, if you add a
little guano, that's where that smell came
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's just the organic part.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you add the sulfur, the organics and
all of it, you get that taste to smell
[SPEAKER_01]: translation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a big believer in sulfur as a part
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, our soil has about twice the
recommended sulfur amount for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, it keeps the nutrients in flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other one is really because of
that flavor aspect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So another one, which is kind of like
sulfur, where like maybe some people use
[SPEAKER_04]: it, some people don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you feel about biochar?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I've got a friend who swears by
it, but I've got a lot of other friends
[SPEAKER_04]: who don't even know what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in all our soil at five percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found enough benefit through researching
terra preta and biochar and all of that to
[SPEAKER_01]: find a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got our worm casting producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just got a new facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got massive indoor space and they
go, do a really good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things they noticed is that
they were doing a lot of farm trials and
[SPEAKER_01]: they had a number of studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them in particular was this guy
growing elephant grass and it was like 11
[SPEAKER_01]: foot tall grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the seeds or something created
like biofuel and it was popular for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while to use organic feeds or fermented
feeds and stuff like that and create
[SPEAKER_01]: biofuel and you get grants for it,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they hired the worm casting producer to
come out there and talk to them about
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things they were looking at
was nodules on the root zone and each one
[SPEAKER_01]: could be removed and grow another plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no matter what they did, the best they
could come up with with all the synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers and nitrates were about four
to five nodules per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they invited our worm casting guy out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He put 50 percent worm castings that he
made and 50 percent biochar, about the
[SPEAKER_01]: size of a rice hole, that kind of texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he put a cup next to each little
planting site and they were getting 50 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 60 nodules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those plants made significant multiple
hundred or thousand percent increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: With corn, they did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little biochar, little castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were able to get that third or
fourth year of corn that really increased
[SPEAKER_01]: a 33 percent increase yield across that
sweet corn that was taken to market at a
[SPEAKER_01]: high dollar price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the biochar for some reason seemed to
be a key link in adding that organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter that couldn't be instantly added to
the field, that sequestered carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the high nitrogen worm castings
next to it balanced the two out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it was done at planting,
it altered the trajectory enough where by
[SPEAKER_01]: the time it was yielding, there was a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the problem we're facing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our soils are already built, have the
castings, have the compost, the CEC,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the nutrients, and now we're going to
add biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we won't notice as significant as
an impact in a situation like that because
[SPEAKER_01]: it can't impart as much of its luxury on
such a special soil where in a native soil
[SPEAKER_01]: devoid of everything, it acts as a little
sponge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're slowly releasing the benefits to
the plant next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe in biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like squeezing a sponge, if you were
to put that in your soil, it can soak up
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the goodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are pre-charging their biochar with
bacteria, with nitrogen and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the cost of it and the fact that
it has all that carbon, I see no reason
[SPEAKER_01]: not to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't notice it doubled my yield or
anything silly like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will hold five times its weight in
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful if you want to use biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biochar is an aeration amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can act as one, but it can also hold a
lot of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess maybe the rule of thumb is that
the better the soil, the less effect it
[SPEAKER_04]: has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the other thing too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at water filtering and we're
looking at heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at all these different
properties that a soil might take into
[SPEAKER_01]: consideration and alternate uses for these
products like pumice is used in beauty
[SPEAKER_01]: products, is used in water filters,
so is biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So adding these things to our filter that
could potentially filter out heavy metals
[SPEAKER_01]: or be a part of that complex of increased
cation exchange is always a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're going to add a little bit
of clay and a little bit of biochar,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like your soil is going to have a
higher CEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked about in the beginning of
this that having that CEC higher means you
[SPEAKER_01]: can hold more nutrients, which means you
can go longer without having additional
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs, which means that a smaller
container of soil should perform better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So recently we've seen a bit of a movement
to replace perlite with some alternative
[SPEAKER_04]: aeration amendments as we've been talking
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that the buckwheat hull is a
good suitable replacement for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I only say that because I bought
buckwheat hull.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were available locally as a natural
alternative to stuffing pillows with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what they're used for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought some, I mixed it in a soil and I
had the worst nitrogen robbing I've ever
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything was yellow, couldn't get
nitrogen to save my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't know if that was just my
batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just never went back to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't give it a fair shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if it was maybe composted
first, it could have an effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm using rice hulls and those have
been sterilized and they work fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem that the rice hull industry
faced was that on greenhouse and large
[SPEAKER_01]: scale in very small containers,
the rice hull company had too high of a
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of viable rice seed they
germinated, fermented and caused anaerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions and killed entire greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they had to put conditions in place
to make sure they knew that how much seed
[SPEAKER_01]: was viable in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it was clean, if it had
chemicals on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now a lot of testing is done and we
can get great rice hulls where the other
[SPEAKER_01]: hulls we're talking about, the buckwheat,
I don't know if they're gonna rob
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how they're grown and all
that enough to tell you if that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, really gonna be the next go-to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just research and see on small
scale, mix it up and see how it works for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd be adding more nitrogen for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in general, do you want to move away
from the perlite?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never used the perlite since I've
started to build the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use pumice, which looks similar,
but it's actually just mined as is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to have energy required
into expanding it to look that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pumice will actually float in water,
but it's a lot heavier than perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're on a farm, you could buy
some pumice, make a water filter that
[SPEAKER_01]: would be, you know, at least a little bit
better than not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has a lot of benefits and it works
really good in our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like using pumice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a mixture of pumice and the rice
hulls.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rice hulls are really high in silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they take a while to break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the buckwheat hulls would probably
break down a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we use the rice hulls and they
also do add the silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got those available,
I look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I know people that use
pea gravel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure you could replace it with
something, but in a one gallon container,
[SPEAKER_01]: perlite has some very unique properties
that'll really be dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it may not be a one-to-one
replacement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have to relearn how to water your
soil and how to work with it if you find
[SPEAKER_01]: something that isn't as ideal as pumice or
rice hulls.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do you feel about people,
I keep bringing him up, the Rev,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and the reason why I bring the
Rev up a lot is because he was actually
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the people who initially got me
into organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you very much for that,
the Rev.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so one of the things he advocates
really strongly is that you use arode
[SPEAKER_04]: water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now for me, I found this to be like a bit
of a long-term annoyance because you have
[SPEAKER_04]: to then supplement with your calcium
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I found that my tap water is like,
it's got like just the perfect amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: calcium in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But he would say, you know, the chlorine
in the water is going to be detrimental to
[SPEAKER_04]: the micro life.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I've always thought, well,
you know, if I use a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: micronutrient to boost those numbers of my
microbes, it's kind of counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's counterproductive and it's just
really easy to just use tap water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you of the same mindset or do you
think, no, it's really got to be arode?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, I mean, you know, God bless the
Rev.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's very strict on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, he said that, you know,
if you can't get arode water, don't
[SPEAKER_04]: bother.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I thought that was a bit of a,
you know, maybe there's not so much truth
[SPEAKER_04]: to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would never use arode water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up using arode water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And long story short, I ended up getting
involved in this company through a few
[SPEAKER_01]: friends that was a short period of my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really just used the product,
but they had a sales opportunity and they
[SPEAKER_01]: sold a product that made alkaline water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it caused you to do a ton of
research on the properties of water and
[SPEAKER_01]: all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was called a Kangen Enagic Water
Machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like 9.5 pH water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could push a button, make 5.5 pH
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it used electricity and some other
things to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And turns out there's some health benefits
to the actual antioxidant property of some
[SPEAKER_01]: of that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I looked into it, that company
called aro water dead water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said the Japanese referred to it as
dead water, completely mineral devoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put it in your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually going to suck stuff out into
it instead of the other way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not found in nature that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started thinking about it and I
since haven't been using aro water and the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing's true in a garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You find that people have to supplement
sometimes with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can potentially leach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you already were paying for aro
water and it's the only thing you could
[SPEAKER_01]: use, I would consider using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I would never pay for it
because it's a waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's no aro system that
doesn't waste water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're using all of your waste
water and filtering it back again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to go through those expensive
filters fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how aro water works is it takes all
the bad stuff, it puts it in the waste
[SPEAKER_01]: water and you throw that away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other water is the good water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of splitting the good from
the bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather just filter it and keep the
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even above that, if you don't have a
great filter, just like you found,
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorine's never hurt my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used a hose on tons of grows and not
caused a detriment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using the mulch layer, having the organic
matter in that top that actually hits that
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorine and turns it and breaks it apart
and off gases it, you can bubble the water
[SPEAKER_01]: to get the chlorine out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it has chloramine, it's been proven to
bind to organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people use like vitamin C or use a
little worm castings or whatever they have
[SPEAKER_01]: that's affordable to actually bind to that
chloramine and get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't go waste money on a big aro
water thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer to just use tap water if your
water is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's got a ton of chlorine in it
for some reason, you're worried about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could put some organic matter in that
or bubble it for a day and then use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you'll have a great results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So have you ever looked seriously into
aquaponic cannabis and is it something
[SPEAKER_04]: you'd want to pursue more?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't looked seriously in enough
to really talk intelligently about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I probably should do some more
research, but I'm just turned off
[SPEAKER_01]: initially by the fact that I need
electricity and pumps and containers and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to raise fish in this little
pond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to me like it's more of an
idea of how to have more profit on a
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller square foot by raising protein at
the same time as plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that's not my ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: My ideal is to have the best plant,
regardless of what happens secondarily to
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's not my main motive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also speaking with like the local college,
they'll come down and I worked with the
[SPEAKER_01]: college in Gunnison with their
agricultural department, doing some
[SPEAKER_01]: education with some of their students and
they had an aquaponic set up and I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's your favorite part about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, well, the kids love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I didn't have a huge
answer for why it was so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some growers have really found
great ways to even cultivate cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: that method as far as aquaponic,
but I've not seen it done properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually the nutrients that the cannabis
needs are too intense for the fish and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to have biofilters and plants growing
and all these other things to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, it's the ultimate complication
of what could be simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go fish in the lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can grow my food in the ground and I can
go spend the rest of my time having fun
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of tinkering with a hybrid
combination of the both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that there's going to be a
couple of people that'll do some amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: things with aquaponics in areas where the
land is awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no fish to fish and there's going
to be a purpose for it and it'll have a
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it's not the ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we don't live on the moon yet and I
don't need to do it that way.
So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is going to be the one question
that's going to be a little bit biased
[SPEAKER_04]: towards synthetics, but here we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the one thing or maybe even a few
things you would give to synthetics that
[SPEAKER_04]: they have over organics or if maybe you
don't want to concede that, what's the one
[SPEAKER_04]: thing about organics you would change?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, from a permaculture
perspective, one of the things that's
[SPEAKER_01]: unique is we'll come up with like there's
one, I forget the Mettlender, I forget the
[SPEAKER_01]: guy's name.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a method where you just bring the
minerals to your garden and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: produce phenomenal results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their argument is that if,
you know, in times hit a few of these
[SPEAKER_01]: small bags of mine, you know, synthetic
minerals, so to speak, or minerals without
[SPEAKER_01]: the carbon in it, they could be your
fastest way to produce on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they've kind of got that beat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rather than having to constantly,
you know, work the farm, have it always
[SPEAKER_01]: there and working so that if shit hits the
fan, you can go produce some food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have that little bit of like
startup, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: First year, I can just go throw out some
hydroponics, be growing and harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I need to turn an acre of clay soil
into good soil, it might take me a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ultimate benefit is, though,
that the soil is going to be there for you
[SPEAKER_01]: forever and give back and be a lot better
investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then when you look at permaculture
and you start talking about these guys
[SPEAKER_01]: that can dial in nutrition and use the
minerals and it's so much better you start
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at how permaculture can actually
create weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a question of whether the rain
came first or the trees came first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe the trees came first and
they started to attract the clouds through
[SPEAKER_01]: their atmosphere that they create.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that creates the rain that creates
more plants and more of an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so ultimately from permaculture,
organics is going to be the ultimate and
[SPEAKER_01]: will create ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in between there, we're going to have
to use all these other systems to help get
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from managing resources, it's going to
be important to move resources from one
[SPEAKER_01]: area to another to start these farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where some of these synthetic
processes can have an advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at the 35 year farm
trials, the data is there that organic is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that in the long term,
organics will always win.
[SPEAKER_01]: These synthetics have these short term
advantages where I feel like we really got
[SPEAKER_01]: duped.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're aware that they are just
short term and have other plans in place,
[SPEAKER_01]: there might be some leverage there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leverage I'm not really willing to play
with, but I feel like a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly enough, on that 35 year farm
report that Rodale does, the least
[SPEAKER_01]: performing corn crop was actually on the
conventional no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: So incorporating both the synthetic and
the non was the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I mean, staying on that idea of like
how you've got to put the time and the
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of the time investment into organics,
how do you feel about the statements slash
[SPEAKER_04]: would you agree with organic gardening
requires forethought and preparation?
[SPEAKER_04]: However, is multitudes of factor easier,
cheaper and yields a better product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the key pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tends to attract an audience that's a
little bit more mature because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: considering planning, pre-planning,
thinking ahead, how it impacts other
[SPEAKER_01]: things in their lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there hasn't been a very profitable
system to enable a brand new person to
[SPEAKER_01]: start organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I agree with that organics
better, but it just has a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: of forethought pre-planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, the other thing that I
find a bit of fallacy is that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: times people would say not only that,
but if you mess up in organics,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no way you're going to correct it
in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take months to turn it
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found that if your soil is built right
and you have an issue, usually a compost
[SPEAKER_01]: tea or a top dress can turn it around
pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So long as you've been training that plant
properly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's actually one of the questions I
was going to bring up is people often,
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the, I call it one of the hydro
mindsets when you're growing organically
[SPEAKER_04]: is that you see a problem and you want to
fix it straight away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you said, you can fix them fairly
quickly, but it's not like hydro or
[SPEAKER_04]: synthetics where it's just, you know,
like overnight fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, flush it and fix it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that this is, you know,
kind of a fallacy for people to use this
[SPEAKER_04]: as a negative of organics when really
maybe they just need to change their
[SPEAKER_04]: mindset a little to not want this kind of
instant gratification of change,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, their nitrogen deficiency or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's also fear of the
unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have so much control,
the steering wheel is in your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, is that we don't require
that control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remove the ego.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are more intelligent at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can tell what they need and how they
need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our job is to provide all of that in
the necessary proportions and given the
[SPEAKER_01]: right environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of times we're banging our
head against the wall and it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen issue in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that your humidity is too low.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants have been dried and now you're
trying to add nitrogen to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in hydro, the humidity didn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sitting in a bed full of water and
changing it out might actually fix that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some false benefits there and
they can become your worst enemy in hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: because you do the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't fix it, killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics, it's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once you realize that you don't
need to change anything, as long as you
[SPEAKER_01]: build it right, you're never going to have
to interrupt one of these problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by doing a little top dressing,
you can get weeks ahead of any potential
[SPEAKER_01]: issues and by using large volumes of soil,
you eliminate the problem already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just flower a plant that's too small for
its container and it's never going to run
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when we're pushing the boundaries,
growing the maximum yield and the smallest
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of medium that we're always going
to run into problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics is no different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is though is that there's a few
tricks that we can use once you get into
[SPEAKER_01]: organics, whether it be an amino acid or
like a compost tea, a fish fertilizer or a
[SPEAKER_01]: top dress that typically can turn it
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of maybe a couple hours,
it might take two or three days,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the detriment of that negative effect
won't be so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that we can still pull
through pretty well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how prevalent do you think the
propaganda of the hydroponic industry is
[SPEAKER_04]: in our kind of community?
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess when I look at it, the thing that
I think of is every breeder that we've
[SPEAKER_04]: ever spoken to, they've expressed a
preference for organic cannabis over
[SPEAKER_04]: hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're in this situation where the tops
of our industry, or I shouldn't say
[SPEAKER_04]: industry, our field promote and endorse
organic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yet the tops of the industry,
the hydroponic industry, obviously do not.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you think we've gotten to this
point where we've got the leaders saying
[SPEAKER_04]: one thing and the masses doing the
opposite?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're trying to appeal to the
masses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were to set a demand for a
product that doesn't exist, you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: fulfill the need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so talking about organics being the
best and not having any organic to share
[SPEAKER_01]: with anybody does anybody, nobody good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the money being spent on marketing is
going to be for what they can sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be for the
hydroponics, the synthetics and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've got a number of synthetic
customers that call me that run
[SPEAKER_01]: unbelievable warehouses with phenomenal
results that are duplicatable,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are crushing it, that are at the peak
of their game.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're implementing organics into their
hydro recipes to get that best of both
[SPEAKER_01]: worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still, even then they're saying it's
not 100% on point and they still would
[SPEAKER_01]: prefer for their ad stash organic soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that's like a really big compliment
because these are people that have seen
[SPEAKER_01]: all of it, seen the big yields,
the small yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know all the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what's a lie, what's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've grown all the different genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you're seeing at the pinnacle of
it, they're still saying there's some sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of genus aqueous, some preference that is
there and they don't know exactly why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the mainstream is
starting to understand that and hear about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the first time I'm hearing in hip
hop and in music growing in organic and it
[SPEAKER_01]: better be that organic as opposed to that
hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yes, this is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's starting to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we get that tipping point where,
for instance, when I was in college,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just weed and I had no clue you
could spray stuff on it and get chemicals
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in it and have powdery mildew and
bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I probably smoked more pesticides and
all that when I was growing up than I care
[SPEAKER_01]: to admit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm now burdened with that new
knowledge and I realize, holy shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you really can take just a plant that I
thought was a plant that was called weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really ruin it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, but now there's a
million flavors and cultivars and
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it just gets more and more
exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how long will it be till we see a Build
a Soil OG being wrapped about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so funny you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a friend that is in the hip hop
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's done a song with some big names like
Snoop Dogg and he's got a charity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of his friends were lost to
overdoses and drugs and just living that
[SPEAKER_01]: fast lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's since come to appreciate
everybody and has just a huge heart,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of love, and he gives away CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grows for the medicinal aspects of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we donate to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also sent a whole bunch of soil to
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've also got Nickatee, who's a
famous hash maker out here and in the hip
[SPEAKER_01]: hop world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just sent a pallet of soil to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there will be some hip hop joke
about it at some point, but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly not the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal is to get more people learning
about organics, experiencing the benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: from it and realizing they don't have to
spend a lot of money or time to get their
[SPEAKER_01]: own grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they want to spend a lot of money
and time, they can certainly geek out on
[SPEAKER_01]: it just as hard as hydro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so have you ever considered maybe
doing something like an online web series,
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of showing people how to do all the
things we're talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just runs into time and problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got one going right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I posted the first post maybe two months
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm about to update it with all that's
happened since then and training the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and picking sexy the seedlings and
doing the transplanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll be finally documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year I tried to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My house got burglarized and the plants
ripped a few weeks into flower because I
[SPEAKER_01]: had some plants outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these are problems that are real
that happened to growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought it couldn't happen to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my doors are unlocked half the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't have any security system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now everything's different in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got really scared and I didn't
want to post the rest of the videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some of those grows the few months
after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now I'm kind of doubling down,
circling back and around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like Build A Soil has been from
the beginning, it's been, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're scared to talk about this
with everybody in your family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you don't want to just go be public
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll do that and we'll bear some of
that burden in hopes that it can help us
[SPEAKER_01]: all learn a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it would be very rewarding to have
those videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll be working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you guys do something like that,
that'd be cool too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope more people share their methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So something that's kind of come up as a
new craze is the whole fermented plant
[SPEAKER_04]: juice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that these products,
I mean, obviously the fermented plant
[SPEAKER_04]: juice to me seems like a really cheap
alternative to some other products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can just make it at home really
easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on the actual benefit level,
put aside costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it outweighs say using some
coconut water and Bokashi?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'm a firm believer that coconut
water is the bee's knees.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I actually think there's some benefit
there greater than I thought when I
[SPEAKER_01]: initially got into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at fermentation, you're using
very small parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Botanical teas, you can use 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, you know, bubbling some
kelp and alfalfa, you could just use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to ferment, you're going to
use, you know, a couple of drops per
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that we're finding
benefit from now, this is anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the evidence in front of me,
but I tend to trust these resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the unique positions I get
put in and build a soil is to talk to a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people that are on the ground doing
this every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not online.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not sharing with anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're sharing with me some of their
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've found that people that have
access to massive amounts of testing
[SPEAKER_01]: because they are at a dispensary or
whatever and they're getting everything
[SPEAKER_01]: tested, even for turpenoids, we're finding
increases by using some of these fermented
[SPEAKER_01]: plant juices of the fruits like papaya and
mango and some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're actually finding some benefit
and taste translation to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there's not a downside from it
unless you overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen that effect though,
where I see a grower use just peat moss or
[SPEAKER_01]: pro mix and they make their own nutrient
line from fermented extracts actually have
[SPEAKER_01]: success.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems to me that it's not balanced
enough and it's more of an addition to a
[SPEAKER_01]: balanced system for some extra added
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it would be to completely be your
nutritional source.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing there is the sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a huge believer in like adding
sugar to the soil, but coconut water is a
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Molasses is a mineral source that has
sugar with it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the right amounts, we're finding that
there is some benefit to taste and flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: to having some of these complex sugars
that realistically the plant shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's doing something else there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously it's not like putting
Kool-Aid in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get that joke, put purple
Kool-Aid in my hydro and it tastes better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, that's not how it freaking
works.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But something about that sugar,
something about the carbs that are there,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of microbe food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe that's what the fermented
plant extract is also bringing you to the
[SPEAKER_01]: table.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in Cho, when he talks about it in
Korean natural farming, he says like a
[SPEAKER_01]: pregnant woman starts to crave fermented
foods that are high in phosphorus and go
[SPEAKER_01]: that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're starting to flower,
some of these fermented plant extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: might be able to hit the nail on the head
with what we needed in that transitional
[SPEAKER_01]: period, because we're not in this big bed
of soil that has everything to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are limited by being indoors with
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't know what the benefit is,
but what I'm hearing is that there is some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of, even on testing data,
they're finding increased terpene counts
[SPEAKER_01]: by using some of these FPJs or FPEs as
you'll call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So time will tell, but I think there's
going to be some benefit there for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do you think is one of the current
techniques or methods or products that
[SPEAKER_04]: people are using that you don't think is
going to stand the test of time?
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe five years from now, we won't really
see a lot of it being used.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see a million probiotic
companies come and go selling some new
[SPEAKER_01]: blend of microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the latest and
greatest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like there'll be a few at the
top that are working with major
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture that are really doing research
and finding benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple non-sulfur bacteria was that
magical one that you see come around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still important, but it's like
everybody was talking about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: like every other word for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you just kind of hear the
background as normal knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's weird when you first start
talking to growers that are brand new,
[SPEAKER_01]: they all start using super thrive for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those vitamin B ones and some of those
fads that kind of happen that come and go,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like they're going to revisit us
from time to time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know, I guess I don't have a
really good answer for that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no worries.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the Builder Soil site, you've got a
little kit to kind of revitalize your
[SPEAKER_04]: soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my question is, if someone says to me,
oh, my soil is depleted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that most of the time they
need that kit or there's just something
[SPEAKER_04]: they need to fix and then they'll realize
it's all actually still there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've just maybe got some lockout or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if they know they've grown in
the soil a lot, watered a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's possibly got leached.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that kit would probably do really
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the kit derived from me not having a
succinct enough answer from my customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kept on saying, well, you just have
something I can buy and put it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, fuck, if it only worked that
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll do my best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my best was looking at a lot of soil
tests where they were in smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: containers and they did grow a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is not looking at really no till
in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like no till should maybe be some
less inputs and some worms and a little
[SPEAKER_01]: compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not exactly the kit, because that's
more for reamending and dumping and
[SPEAKER_01]: tilling and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we found is that nitrogen was a
little low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium was a little low.
[SPEAKER_01]: P and K were mostly fine, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our reamend kit was adding the gypsum
that brought that calcium with the sulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: that would help shuffle the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It added back the crustacean in the kelp,
because normally in a no till,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're advised to put a half cup or a cup
of those materials back in anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: since we're harvesting a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the time, the grain size of
the nutrients we're using are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: for instance, the kelp meal that's pretty
common is like a number 14 grind,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it lasts like five to six months in
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's really microbial active,
it might grow a little faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of that we just add back,
kind of guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we can't guess at, what we
benefit from soil tests that I'm hoping to
[SPEAKER_01]: start to add to our customers in our soil
is boron, iron, manganese, copper,
[SPEAKER_01]: zinc, things that may not show themselves
as important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they are, but may not be as
drastically important in an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you plant full season 10 pound plant
outdoors, we're starting to see some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the weaknesses in our soil recipes for the
first time where boron is just too little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copper is so low that we're getting
powdery mildew in some areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as I learn about this, I want to
teach others where maybe just buying that
[SPEAKER_01]: reamend kit is not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should do a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should add back all of those things so
we have the best chance of success.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most often, just adding the reamend
kit top dressing with compost is more than
[SPEAKER_01]: enough for, you know, almost every grower
unless they're really pushing the
[SPEAKER_01]: extremes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how would you characterize the
difference between say, high bricks soil
[SPEAKER_04]: versus say like the coots mix?
[SPEAKER_04]: Would you just say that the high bricks,
which has been around for quite a while,
[SPEAKER_04]: is more comparable to say super soil
mixture, or you think maybe it's somewhere
[SPEAKER_04]: in between the two of super soil and coots
that is?
[SPEAKER_01]: High bricks soil, are you regarding to
that, you know, gardening philosophy of
[SPEAKER_01]: bricks testing and growing for the bricks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just making sure you weren't talking
about a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: High bricks methodology is typically going
to be lower in potassium, lower in
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus and more on the trace mineral
balancing and not really heavily reliant
[SPEAKER_01]: on compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: They find that compost brings way too much
potassium and that causes an imbalance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just adamant that you can't
have high bricks while involving that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't find that to be the case
with these fast growing annual plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not found bricks testing to be
something that was super informative as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as, you know, making decisions in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm fully willing to change my opinion
on that as I do more research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly higher bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times it does correlate to,
you know, more nutritional products when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to like apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a higher bricks apple or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about the sugar content.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes around to high bricks
gardening practices, though, I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: the compost is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard for me to focus on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I want to look at is not only
having the compost, but all also having
[SPEAKER_01]: the mineral balancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think bringing the best of both
worlds is going to be important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've found with premium compost,
it doesn't have to be so imbalanced that
[SPEAKER_01]: the potassium is out of whack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we're finding, there's little
jewels in each one of these different
[SPEAKER_01]: methodologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I find when you get to the extremist
crowd of any of these groups, I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: little rub, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the most wasteful thing that you
see organic growers do?
[SPEAKER_04]: That you would like them to improve?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say there's two particular,
I guess it depends on the crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times throwing all their soil
away, starting from scratch is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: wasteful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any suggestions on what you
think might be a wasteful practice?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics is typically about not being
wasteful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I've got a friend and he's of the
belief that because cannabis is like a top
[SPEAKER_04]: feeder, that the top soil gets much more
depleted than the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he always throws out the top bit where
all the feeder roots have been,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like by the end of the grow,
it's kind of all locked with roots.
[SPEAKER_04]: He gets rid of that and recycles the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our container is all top soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, we're not in nature
where you have that different sub level
[SPEAKER_01]: layers of minerals and clays, and then
finally the organic matter on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all high organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our whole potting soil is the top soil and
it's all feeder roots in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a deep tap root.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would argue that if he were to test
the top and bottom, they'd be pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: identical, except for in my soil where I'm
top dressing a lot and it would be richer
[SPEAKER_01]: on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I certainly wouldn't want to throw that
portion away.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in general, would you kind of advise
top dressing over using juice like
[SPEAKER_04]: ferments?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, you can improve that
both the humic and the nutritional content
[SPEAKER_04]: of the soil through the top dressing long
term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also get the benefit where you're
giving additional material for the roots
[SPEAKER_01]: to dig into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find that roots at their tip where
they're sloughing off and where they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting that actual absorption and
exchanging cations, that tip is where the
[SPEAKER_01]: magic happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you top dress, you get fresh
new feeder roots digging into that,
[SPEAKER_01]: adding an explosion of growth along with
the nutritional benefits of that top
[SPEAKER_01]: dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the bottom stays where it's a
more balanced, not so nutrient rich,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it can get water and moisture and it
can have those two zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you do that, you're constantly
training these feeder roots, where if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a guy that does no mulch,
no top dress, and all of a sudden you
[SPEAKER_01]: notice a deficiency and you go,
I got a top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might as well just grab a tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've been top dressing and
mulching the whole time, the second you
[SPEAKER_01]: put that top dress down, there's feeder
roots just digging into it the next day or
[SPEAKER_01]: two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really has a much faster effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, I think that's kind of the
difference there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for these next little parts,
we'll just go through some nutrients and
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe you could just fire off some answers
to where people might be able to source
[SPEAKER_04]: them from.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So obvious ones, nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one a lot of us drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that any green material,
any fast growing weed on your property,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can chop down and harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have some nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could top dress with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could feed it to the worm bins,
get nitrogen that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think nitrogen would be pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the number one limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any country that's farming is going to
have access to some sort of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned you use the blood meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's the only source, you might want
to consider continuing to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unfortunately for me, I don't know
really what your resources out there are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to need some guidance from
you on that, but nitrogen should be easy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a lot of nitrogen options,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an interesting one for Australia
because I mentioned earlier, we don't have
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I didn't mention is that the
Australian government has actually limited
[SPEAKER_04]: the amount of phosphorus you can have in
certain products.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it was about a year ago now,
Kana had to redesign their whole liquid
[SPEAKER_04]: product because it was deemed to have too
high of a phosphorus level.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that kind of caused a bit of issues
because a lot of people had to change
[SPEAKER_04]: their whole feeding regiments and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess at the heart of the question
is, yeah, we don't have a lot of available
[SPEAKER_04]: sources of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even guano, as much as you're against
it, is not readily available.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what would be kind of the lesser known
ways to get it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, we use fish bone meal,
which is a 420 zero NPK kind of thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means that it has some nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot of phosphorus though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bone is what's congruent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the bone meal that you're using
may not, it's probably bovine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But either way, if you can get some bones,
that would be a good source of phosphorus.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out there, you may have some more
grass-fed cattle sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may have other ways of getting that
that's better than what I'm currently
[SPEAKER_01]: getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be a great way for you to
get your phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, chicken manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good for phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alfalfa growers out here, number one
limiting factor is phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they'll use chicken manure,
and it's excellent for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is it can be a little hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you compost that chicken manure,
it might be a really, really good source
[SPEAKER_01]: of phosphorus that's at least in a
proportion that probably wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: illegal since it's all natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing to consider is
using phosphorus, solubizing microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's what we had, we had that talk
about indigenous microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing they're really good at
solubizing phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a low phosphorus soil where you're
having trouble buying those amendments,
[SPEAKER_01]: these indigenous microbes might be
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so looking at, you know, Guild Karen
Dang's website, the unconventional farmer,
[SPEAKER_01]: or looking at Dr., you know, looking at
Cho's natural farming, using some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those, the rice boxes to culture your
microbes might be a worthwhile venture
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phosphorus is pretty immobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of it's microbial-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mycorrhizae is going to be another great
addition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that'll really kind of allow it to get
moved into the plant, you reckon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what about the other big one,
potassium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow a comfrey plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have plenty of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you guys have comfrey available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be potassium kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would be good for potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll find potassium sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is what I want to impart more
than just talking about the ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone can have enough comfort
researching amendments based on what
[SPEAKER_01]: plants contain, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for instance, the guy I read about
making world record tomatoes, thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds of tomatoes on one plant growing in
a cage system vertically where he has to
[SPEAKER_01]: get on huge ladders to harvest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did so making his own compost,
and his compost source for nitrogen was
[SPEAKER_01]: the kudzu vine, which was a very fast
growing vine that grew there that was
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like taking over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grew across a road, and it was a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he'd chop it up and use it for his
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you guys can locally find
products and just be comfortable using
[SPEAKER_01]: them for the nitrogen, potassium,
or phosphorus, I think you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be comfrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you find a fast growing weed
that's on your property that's known to
[SPEAKER_01]: have potassium, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, do you feel like in some
ways we're going through a bit of a
[SPEAKER_04]: renaissance in that, go back five years,
there weren't that many people who knew
[SPEAKER_04]: that comfrey was a good potassium and
nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that as we learn more about
these kind of ways to get the nutrients
[SPEAKER_04]: from just the plants around us that will
slowly phase out things like bone meal,
[SPEAKER_04]: and eventually one day you'll be making
your soil mix from just a mixture of
[SPEAKER_04]: plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always going to be economies of
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always going to be that invisible
guiding hand of profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at people that are
telling me, hey, man, I got 300 yards of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I'm going to afford is bone
meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still going to have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so until it becomes more affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the way this happened is,
for instance, I was thinking about this
[SPEAKER_01]: the other day, computers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be so expensive to buy the
first computer ever at that market price.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was those early adopters willing to
invest money and tinkering with stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't very easy to use that just for some
reason they got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It added value to their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were willing to spend all the money
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now, decades later, all of us who
just want to watch Netflix are benefiting
[SPEAKER_01]: from all of their struggle to spend the
money on all this stuff and bring it down
[SPEAKER_01]: to a level where it was produced at a low
cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the biomass that Comfrey can
produce on a property is so unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're finally finding people that are
starting to grow it for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm buying it for way too high of a
price and selling it for way too high of a
[SPEAKER_01]: price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not really ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once we get multiple acreage plots and
hundreds of acres and people are
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting lots of biomass and we can get
the cost down, certainly it'll be a very
[SPEAKER_01]: good, it'll really give a run for bone
meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, a lot of these products
we're buying as fertilizer, you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: remember, they're a waste product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you beat free?
[SPEAKER_01]: They already have a business that is
slaughtering cattle and they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: making extra money selling us the blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to go create a business who has to
profit by selling the Comfrey and growing
[SPEAKER_01]: it and buying the land and all that,
they're going to be up against it
[SPEAKER_01]: competing with trash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're up against the big companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the nutrients that I've found
are a little more harder to find in
[SPEAKER_04]: organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your trace elements and things maybe that
aren't trace elements like silica are
[SPEAKER_04]: often hard to come across in the organic
setting for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you recommend people get their
trace minerals from or things like silica?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, silica covers most of the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though it's not a necessary
nutrient for plant growth, as far as they
[SPEAKER_01]: say, it's in almost all the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They find a way to get it, even though we
shouldn't be able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that just some rock dust will
be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond that, there's other products that
are out there like the potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: silicates, but those are only approved for
organic use as a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've been moving away from those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other products will have silica like the
rice holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can start to find out what in
your area might have a silica content and
[SPEAKER_01]: then ferment that or feed it to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it breaks down, it adds silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to trace minerals,
anything from the ocean is going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why adding fish to the old pile
with the corn and the beans and the Native
[SPEAKER_01]: American principles, it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And adding kelp meal works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has all the trace minerals organically
chelated and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kelp grows in a high salt environment,
so it doesn't take salt into itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not super, super salty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will have some to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, rock dust will have all
your trace minerals too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it needn't be that it's too hard to
find.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was probably hard to find is a
specific like manganese sulfate or copper
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that being said, a lot of the organic
gardeners aren't really using those right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still scared by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm wanting to create a soil that
has some of those in it that's fully
[SPEAKER_01]: minerally balanced for our larger scale
customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably still keep two soils,
one with those in it, one without.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just kind of spurred on this
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Often, whenever someone looks up a kind of
a deficiency diagnostic chart,
[SPEAKER_04]: there will be all these different photos
of, you know, this is a boron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is an iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have, for the life of me, never seen any
of those deficiencies in an organic grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that getting something like,
you know, a zinc deficiency is fairly
[SPEAKER_04]: exclusive to a hydroponic grow and that
organic growing tends to just work those
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of finer nutrients out themselves?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought so.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when we're seeing full
season plants growing 10, 15 pounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: people are experiencing some of these
similar results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're really pushing the
boundaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at an agricultural scale,
micronutrient balancing is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're aware of the downfalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the way I look at it is,
yeah, you can build a house with wood and
[SPEAKER_01]: you need a ton of wood to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those little tiny nails hold it all
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those would be the boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're a building block and a
boron is necessary to make something,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have it, it's going to be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, nature can diversify.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't put all its eggs in one basket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has more than one way of doing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're certainly going to put stress
on the system once you get past that,
[SPEAKER_01]: once you get to that limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I mentioned earlier, some of our
growers, in fact, there's a thread on
[SPEAKER_01]: ICMAG that I'm involved in right now and
the Advancing Ego Agriculture thread where
[SPEAKER_01]: I just posted some of our soil test
results under my moniker, Mile High Guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not used it in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why is some of the people
growing full season were having problems
[SPEAKER_01]: with our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other people are having really good
success with our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're trying to improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to find out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like the boron, it looks like
the copper and some of these things are
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming really, really important when it
comes to full season plants and balancing
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the calcium is there,
but the water has tons of carbonates and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's locking some of the calcium out and
boron might help that or whatever the case
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm just kind of talking out of
my ass now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it can be important and I really
feel like every detail will be important
[SPEAKER_01]: when we get to that level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking into all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly, hydroponics has you in
control where you have to add all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: at exact proportions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think we're intelligent enough
to know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as we get it to the point where
it's into soil and it's above the limiting
[SPEAKER_01]: factor, I feel like organics is not going
to have those issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to sort it out on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to do significantly better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in hydro, it's very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have a boron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow in nature, we're able to overcome
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some boron there and it's going to
do a little bit, but it's much more
[SPEAKER_01]: apparent in hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what those photos come from.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's talk about some mistakes that
converted growers make when they're
[SPEAKER_04]: transitioning to organics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll talk about some likely reasons
as to why they're running into problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just give you some topics and you
can just let us know what you think.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if someone's got bugs and they've just
converted to organic, we're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: fungus, gnats, annoying bugs, not spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think their problem is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's tough to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ecosystem is not fully developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in a no-till system that's been
going a long time, you'll pull back the
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch and you'll find so much diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what's more challenging in that
system is for any one thing to get out of
[SPEAKER_01]: proportion and scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we have a fresh soil that's
really wet on top, we're trying to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: the mulch and top dress and do all these
fantastic things we learn about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're breeding the perfect habitat for
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're implemented and the
ecosystem isn't so developed and things
[SPEAKER_01]: that eat fungus gnats, because they
haven't been there, we're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like I said, outdoors, it may not
be an issue to have fungus gnats indoors
[SPEAKER_01]: in a tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get in your fan and your light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get in the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now all of a sudden, we can't wait
for these predators to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to sort of create that
ecosystem on our own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd say a brand new grower,
number one mistake they're making is
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially maybe a little overwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's just up against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they had fungus gnats larvae in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing they can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so from there, having a bigger soil,
having a fuller ecosystem, having the
[SPEAKER_01]: predator mites, having all of those
different variables is really going to
[SPEAKER_01]: help that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's tough to say exactly what they're
doing wrong.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so let's just say someone did have
some fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be the new convert to organic?
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be your recommendations for how
they handle the pest management?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like the IPM, because this is
something I get asked a lot because I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: always trying to convert people over and
they usually get fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my usual answer is get some neem
or some predator nematodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: What would be your recommendation as like
a first port of call?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they've noticed it's because the
top is wet and they are mulching and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: overwatered.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I previously mentioned, just scraping
that entire mulch layer off, putting it in
[SPEAKER_01]: a trash bag, getting it out of the house,
going and sprinkling down, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the frass or the neem cake or whatever
you've got, that's going to help as a
[SPEAKER_01]: preventative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then covering that with a premium
barrier, like a compost or vermicompost
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not infested with larva.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that should almost wipe it
out because it removes most of the larva
[SPEAKER_01]: and it covers it with a drier layer of a
material that has a lot of bacteria and
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it should be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's where it adds insult to injury.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell somebody that and they take compost
full of fungus gnats larva and pile it on
[SPEAKER_01]: and problems just get worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had people that have gotten all
the nematodes, all the mites and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything and still had a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's only one of their areas and one
of their grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they cannot figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if one thing's proven for sure,
it's that farmers are never going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: it a hundred percent easy street.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to earn a little bit
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in nature, when we have, you know,
a hundred acres, there's a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of crop loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a given.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doors with two plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to allow for any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of those things where we're
not going to win every single battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes having to start over and
scrap it and build new soil may be what
[SPEAKER_01]: has to happen to artificially create this
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're going to have some of these
issues that are a byproduct of our own
[SPEAKER_01]: creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Masanobo Fukuoka says,
as soon as you prune the first branch on
[SPEAKER_01]: the tree, well, you're in control of it
from now on out.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as we put the container indoors
and throw the light up, well, we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have some of these issues to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it becomes more in building your
confidence and how little it might affect
[SPEAKER_01]: you or how able you are to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, that's really
the main difference maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had powdery mildew on an outdoor plant
this year in only one area.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the others had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I tested a Tweetment, which is a
product we carry with peppermint,
[SPEAKER_01]: boron, and some enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's totally harmless, but I was worried
it would taste like peppermint on the
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talking to the manufacturer,
they didn't feel like it was a high enough
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be too volatile and would off
gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I sprayed the whole plant down three
times and the powdery mildew is completely
[SPEAKER_01]: gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was willing to gamble a little
bit to learn that lesson.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I have a problem again next year,
I guarantee you I'll whip out that same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and it'll work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But preventatively, we talked about hydro
versus organic before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times the difference is like
Western medicine treats symptoms by
[SPEAKER_01]: covering them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times hydro methods will do the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organically, we're trying to get back to
what's causing that problem and fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be, like I said,
maybe the copper was why the plant got
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't pretend to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know that I'm learning more about
that, you know, every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what would be your advice to the new
convert on how to approach
[SPEAKER_04]: troubleshooting?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because this is something I find is the
biggest issue is the way they try to solve
[SPEAKER_04]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start to think about the soil,
you say, OK, the soil was recently made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I followed a proven recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely, it's not a lack of nutrients,
but more a lockout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, what I'm going to look at
is the overwater, the underwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do I verify that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, keeping track of the weight of the
container and how heavy it feels at its
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimate moisture content should tell you
if it's heavier than that, you've
[SPEAKER_01]: overwatered.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's much lighter, you're
underwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then from there, what affects the moisture
uptake is going to be the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things that a lot of
growers don't look at, which can be very
[SPEAKER_01]: important with energy efficient lights in
organic soil, is the VPD or vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: deficit, which is the relationship of
humidity and temperature in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you've got way too high of a
humidity, it creates this pressure where
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants can't drink and they just slow
down and they're not growing, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: the light bacon and even though the
nutrients are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have the opposite,
where you have a 40% grow room humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's at 80 degrees because you're not
wanting mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certain cultivars are not going to be
able to transpire.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will shut down three hours into that
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the nutrients are there, but they're
not going to take it up because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not photosynthesizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And photosynthesis is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we have to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the nutrients are in there,
we know we made the soil, then it's
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at environment, looking at
watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go through those every time,
oh, my God, I got a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really old soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might actually be a lack of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then I want you to consider that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at top dressing or foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go, oh, my God, what's gone?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yellowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you just start to think,
is it new soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it shouldn't be nutrients then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, how's my environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, shit, my environment's off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Problem solved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my environment's dialed.
[SPEAKER_01]: My soil's fresh and that's dialed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What could this possibly be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm going to look at moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it too heavy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it overwatered?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it underwatered?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm positive that I'm across the board,
perfect, the watering is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The environment's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I made the soil and I followed all
the protocol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if it's every single plant in the
grow room, I'm going to go, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: holy shit, maybe that compost wasn't as
good as I thought it was or look at some
[SPEAKER_01]: of those variable inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's only one or two plants,
I'm going to say, okay, is this a
[SPEAKER_01]: different genetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it's not a different genetic,
is it potentially in the corner of the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room where the fan is hitting it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it right under the light in the hottest
area?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so after I've ruled out all of those
basic variables, I'm going to get a friend
[SPEAKER_01]: involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be like, what the hell am I
not seeing that you might be able to see
[SPEAKER_01]: here?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like proofreading your own
report in school.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just sometimes you just skim over the
same exact mistakes over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoot, maybe it's your first time
experiencing a really bad russet mite
[SPEAKER_01]: problem and you think it's a nutrient
uptake issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So adding in professional help at some
point, even if it's just a friend,
[SPEAKER_01]: can be a big time help.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main things, environment,
watering, how old or how new the soil is.
[SPEAKER_01]: When was the last time I teed your top
dress?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you answer all those honestly,
you'll know if it's a lockout or a
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency and how to go forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's kind of funny that you
mentioned that russet mite thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: because anyone who watches a really cool
grower on YouTube called MediCropper,
[SPEAKER_04]: he had a very similar thing happen to him.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it took like months before he realized
what happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, it was really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't that where he even had like new
lights and he thought it was the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it turns out it wasn't that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He thought it was the nutrients at first.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he thought it was the lights and
then he thought it was blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_04]: blah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, and he couldn't, he was just
visually looking for the russet mites and
[SPEAKER_04]: he couldn't see them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously they're a lot smaller than
the spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And up until that point, everything that
was a problem you could see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is the first time you have to
scope every week as a part of your IPM to
[SPEAKER_01]: look for things you can't even see as a
potential problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's where it becomes crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have people outdoor that get
wilt, some sort of fungus or Fusarium
[SPEAKER_01]: problem that is just horrific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we look at micronutrients as
potentially the cause of that excess
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus, not enough micronutrients
causing these little festering problems
[SPEAKER_01]: that can become really good homes for
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's probably why
Australia is monitoring the phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_01]: how it affects the water and how it
affects the plants and all these things,
[SPEAKER_01]: is they're aware of the larger ecosystem
impact that we're starting to learn about
[SPEAKER_01]: when we grow in these methods.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I would love to think the
government has that kind of forethought,
[SPEAKER_04]: but based on other issues, I'm not quite
so sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, so last one.
[SPEAKER_04]: For this section, reusing soil,
what would be your advice to the new?
[SPEAKER_04]: So someone's just finished their first
organic grow and they've been hearing
[SPEAKER_04]: about reusing their soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: How should they actually do it for their
first time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I take the plant and I would let's say I
just harvested and I brought it out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm left with one container.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a stock sticking out of it and
I'm ready to go for ease.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just pretend this is a 15 gallon
because that's kind of what we recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: as a minimum size for starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll take that, you'll cut the plant
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, there's a couple of
different questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a no-till, in a big bed, one might just
plant a clone a foot to the right of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in a 15 gallon, a foot to the right
means you're not in the container anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're probably going to dig out that
stock and that root ball and put your
[SPEAKER_01]: clone right back in that hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I do that, I'm going to sprinkle
mycorrhizae in the hole, put the clone in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's in there, I will sprinkle back
some nutrients that I know are never going
[SPEAKER_01]: to hurt, but could be lacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be whatever I have,
kelp, crustacean, neem, anything
[SPEAKER_01]: well-rounded, the blend of all three.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I just had neem, I would do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty good NPK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well-rounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would top dress that and then cover
that with a little compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really wanted to, you could like
put some gypsum in and a few other things
[SPEAKER_01]: and really start thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, if that plant,
when harvested, wasn't completely just
[SPEAKER_01]: drained, wasn't like 10 times the size
that it should have been in that little
[SPEAKER_01]: container, and it wasn't just completely
flushed, meaning it was just a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: transition, good size plant, probably
still had some more nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just harvest it, immediately plant
another one in there, sprinkle some
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients on top, cover it with compost,
and I'm ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do that all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, you know, we have a re-amend kit and
some people will use that, but if they've
[SPEAKER_01]: got their own organic nutrients at home,
a lot of times we'll just talk them into
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for a 15 gallon container,
we know that that's about two cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And normally our recommendation when
building soil is about, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: one and a half to three cups of nutrients
at the very most per cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a top dress, I would probably never
put more than three cups of nutrients on
[SPEAKER_01]: top.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could probably realistically do six
without hurting anything, but I would just
[SPEAKER_01]: put a cup of this, cup of that,
up to three cups, cover it with compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's how you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll experience some really good
results doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to take it to the next
level, you could send some of that soil
[SPEAKER_01]: off for a sample at the soil lab,
get a report back and analyze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guarantee you, you're going to be
surprised at how little that report is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have you add back.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only caveat there is if you grew a
really big plant and you really did water
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot, it might be really low in nitrogen
and calcium and stuff once you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly even those few cups of
amendments and compost would probably be
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to get you going on that next
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before flour, you could judge again if
you wanted a top dress again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on that same note, the nutrients
potentially needing a replacement if
[SPEAKER_04]: they've been leached out, do you find that
it's necessary slash advisable for people
[SPEAKER_04]: to water until there is that 10% runoff
like what people advise in hydroponics or
[SPEAKER_04]: not necessarily?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I do no runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why is we don't have salts
that we need to exchange and get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not replacing what nutrients are
in there with a new balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water is more of just the carrying
medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just keeping it moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't do any runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anything, I will notice a little runoff
and I'll stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not like, I'm worried about it,
but I like in cocoa, you have to have an
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to push all the old out,
get all the new in, and you need a large
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of runoff to do that properly,
which is wasteful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the main problem we have is
probably the opposite when you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting runoff and you're in a big
container, making sure that you don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: that bottom of the container just totally
soaking wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will alternate between a little light
watering on top to a deeper watering,
[SPEAKER_01]: but definitely not to run off.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, have you ever run a wicking
style grow system and how did it go?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the earth boxes that I currently
use and recommend a lot of newer growers
[SPEAKER_01]: to use has a wicking system in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sub irrigated planter holds about a
cubic foot and a half a soil on a tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And below there is two and a half gallons
of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The corners of the plastic rectification
rectangular grow box are impressed down
[SPEAKER_01]: into the water and you pack that soil
tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that acts as a sponge that wicks the
water up to the rest of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unbelievable results with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a clone in there, put the soil in,
and then maybe the benefit is you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: top watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually mound compost and
nutrients well above the sides of the
[SPEAKER_01]: container and put the plastic cover back
on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that keeps the moisture all inside the
container constantly wicking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've found that you can take that
earth box that's only about 10 gallons of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and it'll mimic very closely what a
20, 30 gallon container of soil can do in
[SPEAKER_01]: a geopod.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then from there, outdoors,
I found it better to just use the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: or large volumes of soil, not to build a
swimming pool to do a sub irrigated
[SPEAKER_01]: planter in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm finding that each one of these
is a tool to be used in a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also seeing permaculture people
doing these big wicking beds and sub
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation was a big part of nature with
underground currents and water and
[SPEAKER_01]: underground aquifers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there's definitely benefit to
both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a huger culture also uses some sub
irrigation in the rotting wood.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for this final part of the interview,
we're just going to go over some questions
[SPEAKER_04]: we had sent in by our listeners.
[SPEAKER_04]: The very first one, this is the only one
I'm going to read in the terminology they
[SPEAKER_04]: sent it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why you know more ship to Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mad bro?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because it's been a big
challenge and we were flying under the
[SPEAKER_01]: radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are actively working on switching our
Canadian shipping so that we can be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had to turn it off the other day
because we started just losing hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why is that a number of our
orders were just flying through the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in order to avoid the taxes and
tariffs and fees that come with importing
[SPEAKER_01]: to Canada, the best way is to use the USPS
and the reason why is they have a standing
[SPEAKER_01]: reciprocating agreement between the United
States to work with each other where FedEx
[SPEAKER_01]: and UPS is going to charge us a lot of
money and charge you a lot of money
[SPEAKER_01]: without telling us how much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to involve like a specialist
and we have to guess at the fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only way is USPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we don't have international tariff
codes on all of our items because we
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacture them and don't know what the
hell an international tariff code even is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of a sudden in customs,
this product that should be charged no
[SPEAKER_01]: taxes is just held up and said,
hey, you don't have international tariff
[SPEAKER_01]: code and we're holding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our customers would order items
they needed and they'd get turned around,
[SPEAKER_01]: held in customs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't get their money back for 30
to 45 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd ship a more product at an extremely
high expense and then it would just fail
[SPEAKER_01]: and we would just be left apologizing to
the customer and holding the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so right now we're going through with
a team and getting every single
[SPEAKER_01]: international tariff code.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're in Canada and you want to
order right now, email the order to
[SPEAKER_01]: support at Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us the items you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll look up the tariff codes and we'll
use your order as a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll probably even give you a discount to
do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on it right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure the fan who sent that in will be
very happy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So next question.
[SPEAKER_04]: On your IPM mixture on the site,
we've got a listener who wants to use it
[SPEAKER_04]: in late flower, but they were wondering,
does this render the parts of the plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: specifically the leaves, unusable?
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, if they wanted to say use
it a few weeks before harvest and then
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe juice those leaves after harvest,
are they still good to go or you think
[SPEAKER_04]: those leaves are probably no longer
edible?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're probably totally fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the only caveat to that is just like
produce, I'd have to wash the leaves and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I had something that was totally
natural sprayed on there and I could
[SPEAKER_01]: actually put it in a salad spinner and
soak them and wash them and yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: great, juice them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a big deal, but you know,
the flowers are where the oil comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where it becomes a little
bit more of a sticky situation and people
[SPEAKER_01]: are really scared about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other reason is, you know,
juicing, we have our liver, we have our
[SPEAKER_01]: stomach, we have our kidneys, all these
things that help us process when we light
[SPEAKER_01]: it on fire, it's going right into the
blood, it's bypassing all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it becomes very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in considering some of that,
the products that I felt the most safe
[SPEAKER_01]: with are the Big Time Exterminator and the
Tweetment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are both enzyme-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also got the owner of Taraganics,
EM1 says that you could spray EM1 mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: with yucca extract up until, you know,
the last week of harvest or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then wash after and not have any
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a great fungicide and a great way
to out-compete powdery mildew and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure what your exact problem
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only answer I can give you that's the
number one recommended is never ever spray
[SPEAKER_01]: your flowers with anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: From personal experience, that's not
always the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's for personal use and you're
willing to test it out, I tried that
[SPEAKER_01]: Tweetment product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm guessing you might be able to get it
international.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but it's an enzyme-based
cleaning product that's got really nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: in it, but enzymes, water, the peppermint
oil and the borax or the borate,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it works phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't had any issues also the
big-time exterminator.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a number of people do testing
and enter contests and never fail due to
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the nature of these tests is they only
test for what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the purists will say that spraying
on your flowers could potentially lead to
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's inhaled and we just don't
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the only guaranteed way is don't
spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I think there's a number
of things that you can do, including
[SPEAKER_01]: essential oils in a small amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we'll volatilize and not be part
of the final product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our next listener says, I don't live in
the USA, but I wanted to make my own fish
[SPEAKER_04]: compost after seeing your video.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I'm scared of composting meat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any tips?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never done fish compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guys that do the fish compost have
a pretty good process for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got huge piles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put the whole fish in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got hardwood and all this other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it sounds pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put the fish in there and have at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you and I both know that certain
issues can arise that you didn't expect or
[SPEAKER_01]: plan for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would maybe look at making your
own fish hydrolysate and you can make your
[SPEAKER_01]: own lactobacillus serum, grind the fish
up, blend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time it has no odor and is back
to a stable pH, you have your own fish
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has no stabilizing agent in it and it
should work really, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I mean, people have
buried whole fish right in their planting
[SPEAKER_01]: hole for corn and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to imagine making compost with it
wouldn't be too different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just put it in the pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would Google and I would look up maybe
some loose percentages on what percent of
[SPEAKER_01]: fish to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, it's going to be a
part of your carbon to nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So worst case, if there's no help,
I would look up the nitrogen content of
[SPEAKER_01]: average fish per pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would balance that against the
standard carbon to nitrogen ratio of
[SPEAKER_01]: compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bet you it worked just fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just as a bit of a side question,
I've read a lot of stuff lately saying
[SPEAKER_04]: that you should opt for just in general,
I know that you just said it and I'm going
[SPEAKER_04]: to pronounce it wrong, but hydrocylates
over emulsions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that that's true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And emulsion is a chemical extraction and
hydrolysate is blended in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of times a hydrolysate is
still going to have a stabilizing agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why is these fish
hydrolysates.
[SPEAKER_01]: The product that we're currently
purchasing, they're fishing a very deep
[SPEAKER_01]: water fish that's very fatty and bony.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's low and heavy metal and it's
very well tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why they buy it is they're
making a glucosamine chondroitin product
[SPEAKER_01]: for the health market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they need a bony fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a bony fatty fish is also great for
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they have a good secondary market
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they use citric, I'm sorry,
they use phosphoric acid and it's the kind
[SPEAKER_01]: that like makes soda pop, like Coca-Cola
has phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use that kind and it stabilize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a number of growers are like,
hey, phosphoric acid, what the hell,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want it in my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the amount they use is very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as you dilute it, it becomes a
non-issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like how honey is antibacterial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you dilute honey, it immediately
grows mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a non-issue once it's diluted.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is though, it's not the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the reason they use it is it makes
the P number on their NPK label a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: higher using phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is a P source.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the company we're working with,
they have a Asian market that once a year
[SPEAKER_01]: gets a citric acid stabilized version.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're gonna try and get that in the
next batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And beyond that, I'm hoping one day in the
future they make a lactobacillus version.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then fish hydrolysate would be
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a waste product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to do something with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And either composting it or turning it
into fertilizer makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, there's a subset of
people that will say any fertilizer like
[SPEAKER_01]: that liquid is feeding the plant,
not feeding the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on an agricultural level, they'll say
it actually does feed the soil and they
[SPEAKER_01]: can prove it by measuring how much
nitrogen is left over after these
[SPEAKER_01]: feedings, even after the crops are
harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to be true, but the main
source we see for selling right now is the
[SPEAKER_01]: Ingham crowd and a lot of the compost tea
brewers that are using fish hydrolysate as
[SPEAKER_01]: a food source for the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're using such a small amount that
by the time the tea is brewed,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no fish hydrolysate even left.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just fed the microbes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to clarify, when you say I'm
potentially adding some lactobacillus,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's the same stuff that's in kombucha,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The drink?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know kombucha would be a whole bunch of
other different consortium.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kombucha, the material that makes it
is called a scoby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a symbiotic colony of bacteria and
yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of research on what
specifics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do use kombucha because it's
got a very low pH and they can use that
[SPEAKER_01]: for powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the lactobacillus is actually,
a lot of people will be lactose intolerant
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's a sugar that's a milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the lactobacillus is a serum that's
made from taking a rice wash water,
[SPEAKER_01]: high in carbohydrate, and getting all of
the indigenous lactobacillus that's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air in there, and then putting that milk
to stifle all the other bacteria and just
[SPEAKER_01]: feed the lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll turn to whey and curd.
[SPEAKER_01]: The curd is the cheese, the whey is the
clear liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the lactobacillus serum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically a whey protein powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: The liquid version, while it's still
alive, it's high in amino acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: high in protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the farming world, feeding animals
with high protein, turning over to
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture means high nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you use that lactobacillus,
it's a great decomposer.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, it can break down that
fish, remove the odor and keep it stable
[SPEAKER_01]: and lower that pH down to about 3.5 so you
don't have to add the phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that is actually really interesting
you mention that because anyone,
[SPEAKER_04]: if they want to check out my Instagram
page, they'll see that I'm a bit of an
[SPEAKER_04]: avid cheese maker fan.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, yeah, I didn't realize until right
now I've actually got lactobacillus
[SPEAKER_04]: hanging around all the time when I
separate my whey off the top of the curd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indigenous cheese making, a lot of
times, for instance, everybody's heard of
[SPEAKER_01]: San Francisco sourdough bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's called that because the San
Francisco bacteria that's in the area is
[SPEAKER_01]: only native to that region and it imparts
a certain flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can send me your culinarily chef
prepared sourdough starter from San
[SPEAKER_01]: Francisco, but if I make it at my house by
about the second time, it's totally
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where the indigenous
microorganisms come to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where, when we're talking about
lactobacillus, it's crazy, but all the
[SPEAKER_01]: protein powders on the market here in the
United States, fat-free became a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when cheese became popular
because fat-free milk was being sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to take all the fat off and all
of a sudden you had grated cheese,
[SPEAKER_01]: cheese slices, government cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there you have the next
waste product, all of the whey from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cheese making that they end up using for
the protein powders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we find the premium protein
companies use grass-fed cattle and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at home, if you've got your own goats
or if you've got some raw, all-natural
[SPEAKER_01]: milk, that would be the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly any milk I think would work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's kind of an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're probably going down a bit of a
rabbit hole here, but that's a bit of an
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting one.
[SPEAKER_04]: The quality of protein, because yeah,
I read some studies and they say that the
[SPEAKER_04]: cheaper the quality of protein you find,
the higher the glycine content in it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And glycine is kind of the least useful of
all the amino acids.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's interesting that it does translate
the way it does, especially when you
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned the grass-fed cattle and then
how that translates into protein powder
[SPEAKER_04]: being better quality.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many crossovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always tell people cannabis is a
gateway, a gateway to a healthier
[SPEAKER_01]: lifestyle and realizing that there's a lot
more going on than I knew before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our next question, it's a little bit
extended.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the cheapest way to start an
organic cannabis grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: So this person has said, is it possible
for me to veg a plant in a bag of potting
[SPEAKER_04]: mix, just some regular potting mix,
and then transplant it into a big pot?
[SPEAKER_04]: The bottom half is compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: The top half is just the same potting mix.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that work essentially with just
water only?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess what their question is,
is can you grow a nice plant with just a
[SPEAKER_04]: bag of compost and a bag of potting soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I've been challenged before.
[SPEAKER_01]: People said, oh, you love nature so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you just throw a seed outside?
[SPEAKER_01]: See what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, shit, I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of the best grows I've ever
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, each soil is going to be
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then happened to be an old chicken
coop and the soil was pretty good in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge I would have to him is the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll put the compost on top of the
potting soil underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how nature works.
[SPEAKER_01]: The compost isn't just underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where all the minerals are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would do the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I had a challenge with the
super soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hot part was on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get it because the roots are
eventually going to hit that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they don't talk about is that the
first thing a plant does is search for the
[SPEAKER_01]: walls of its container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within the first couple of days,
it's sending roots everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So putting it up top would be more where
it can balance what to do with those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly just growing with some
compost and everything, the number one
[SPEAKER_01]: limiting factor, meaning if your compost
isn't balanced, it would be better to have
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of it so that it could just eat the
portion that it needs as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: reaching that imbalance sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we lack in quality, we can make up
for in quantity, at least a little bit in
[SPEAKER_01]: organics in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how cheap it can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, the cheapest way as far as
following all these recipes would be to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the cocoa core, get your own compost,
get some sort of aeration, mix it together
[SPEAKER_01]: and plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the cheapest way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've even seen people make 50-50 their own
homemade compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just use that and aerate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they plant into it and their plants do
great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the final question for this interview,
I think we've already kind of answered it,
[SPEAKER_04]: but obviously the person didn't know that,
submitting it beforehand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can organic growing consistently yield as
much as hydro on a small commercial scale
[SPEAKER_04]: with the same or less amount of input?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm assuming this person, they're from
the States, I'm assuming that they're
[SPEAKER_04]: wanting to switch over their little home
grow that they probably sell for a little
[SPEAKER_04]: living.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it can consistently yield as
much with the same or less effort slash
[SPEAKER_04]: input?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the question though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll always have hydro growers that are
going to tell me they can do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll always have organic growers that
can tell me they can do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I pay attention to in particular
is the growers that have done both at the
[SPEAKER_01]: pinnacle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they always say that there's always
room for improvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ways to get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly I think one of the benefits
is you probably could force a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: yield out of hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to be the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the factor is, at that point where you
push it beyond, almost like steroid usage,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it really healthy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it tasteless as good, or are we pushing
it beyond the balance?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would say that with a quality and
perspective, yes, you can hit those yields
[SPEAKER_01]: every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we look at that actual farm trial
of agriculture, not horticulture,
[SPEAKER_01]: but large scale, for sure, if you go look
at the Rodale farm study, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: see that every year, year in, year out,
and over the whole 30 years, organics not
[SPEAKER_01]: only did just as good, but won.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is definitely interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, kind of like I mentioned
steroids before, you're going to see a
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatic result in the beginning,
but down the road, if you're not keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else perfect, you're going to
see that it's artificial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't translate to as much real
strength and that it could be detrimental
[SPEAKER_01]: to your health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with using synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: A number of countries that adopted
synthetic practices are worse off than
[SPEAKER_01]: they were before and are having superweeds
and all sorts of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're doubling down and going back
to their old practices and the
[SPEAKER_01]: government's right there behind them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So indoors on a facility, the main
limiting factor is going to be that
[SPEAKER_01]: grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes for hydro, that goes for
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the other thing to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phantom yield is what I call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can get 10 pounds hydro or 10 pounds
organic, there's apples to apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what if I only get eight in the
organic and 10 in the hydro, but I made
[SPEAKER_01]: twice as much money off the eight than I
did the 10?
[SPEAKER_01]: That phantom yield is going to be more
important to me and that's what real
[SPEAKER_01]: investors are looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that's done in, let's say,
commercial real estate is it's called the
[SPEAKER_01]: cap rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it might be a billion dollar
building, but if you only make a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: bucks a month, why would you spend so much
money?
[SPEAKER_01]: Contrary to an area where you could buy a
cheaper building and make a lot more money
[SPEAKER_01]: per month.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're looking at growing organic
versus hydro, keeping quality in
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, the profits can be there or
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, that's what we're talking about
when we're talking yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I can go spend a whole bunch of
money and get a lot of yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean it was efficient.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like to use the, again, the revs
analogy of synthetics being like,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, you're force feeding it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like sure you can get it bigger than it
wants to be, but is it the right thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the right thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess, you know, you can get a
strawberry in the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the size of a golf, bigger,
you know, maybe the size of a tennis ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to have as much flavor as
that one you find on the forest floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the size of a quarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're hoping to do is find a limit at
which we can get between there and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, can you imagine the translation if
we were able to really do this on scale
[SPEAKER_01]: and then take maybe let's say a product
like wine that has to historically have a
[SPEAKER_01]: drought to have any flavor and actually be
able to produce it a higher quantity and
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that could be pretty cool,
but there's that limiting factor,
[SPEAKER_01]: yield versus that relationship of that
flavor and taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no way to have all of it at
the very top because the biggest producing
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics a lot of times aren't even the
ones that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now taking the same genetic with all
the flavor and getting the most yield out
[SPEAKER_01]: of that, I think is really the question.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess my personal little final
question is, do you believe personally
[SPEAKER_04]: that with the cannabis plant, it is kind
of that invisible seesaw of, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like the yield on the one end or the
flavor and potency on the other?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or do you think like, no, you can find a
happy medium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, certainly you can find a happy medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's crazy is when you get too
narrow in any niche like yield and
[SPEAKER_01]: specific plants, there's going to be
people wanting more yield, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at a certain point, you have to
ask, is there enough flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is my yield good?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be genetic based.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, for instance, squash,
right now, you know, if you grow one
[SPEAKER_01]: squash plant, you can feed five families
off the damn thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have a hundred of them every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you go talk to the squash breeders
and what are they trying to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Give more freaking yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I don't need more yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a better tasting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where we start looking at
heirloom seeds and stuff that's whole
[SPEAKER_01]: focus wasn't yield, but flavor and color
and beauty and reasons why individual home
[SPEAKER_01]: gardeners kept these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we're seeing certain
cultivars that don't produce very well
[SPEAKER_01]: being popular in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they command a better price because
those flavors, tastes and appearance are
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll find a happy medium, but it's
going to be based on genetics and grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room and environment and really just
getting better every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think that brings us to the end of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was there any comments or shout outs you
wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I guess just keep an open mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned, get out of that
minefield of being on the high horse of
[SPEAKER_01]: organics and even learn from all the
synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that you'll be a well,
more well-rounded grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but I really do want to leave people
that are on the fence considering
[SPEAKER_01]: organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to have all these potential
problems and you can get yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if you're going down to
the shop and the only opportunity you have
[SPEAKER_01]: is hydro, maybe start that way,
but reach out, follow the podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: find some of these resources that are
going to be becoming more available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Australia and look at what we're doing
over here and take a little time and
[SPEAKER_01]: duplicate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'll be well worth your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to be really excited to
share the results with your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, Hey man, look what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at how amazing this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's, you know,
like you mentioned, asking your friends
[SPEAKER_01]: how to convert and it's, there's nothing
you can say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to show them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks so much to Jeremy from
Builderslow for taking the time to sit
[SPEAKER_03]: down with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge thank you to Jeremy from Builderslow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go check out builderslow.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks again, 420 Australia.
Forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: La la la la la la.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
