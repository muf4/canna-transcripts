two of our chat with Chimera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to jump back to some of the stuff
about David slash Sam, because we have had
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years a plethora of pretty
interesting questions asked about him,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we've never really been able to have
answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess one of the ones I was personally
interested in is that a lot of the stories
[SPEAKER_00]: around the strains that have come out
through David have sometimes portrayed him
[SPEAKER_00]: as not really the active breeder,
but more of like a steward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that regard, I mean, like if you
look at Skunk, there was often a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: credit given to Sacred Seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at Hayes, you know,
obviously his neighbors kind of developed
[SPEAKER_00]: that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see him in the picture of
like, do you view him as the creator of
[SPEAKER_00]: those strains or more of just someone who
brought them to the world?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he bred Skunk one from scratch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody that says different just doesn't
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Dave assembled that from scratch.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hayes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was these two dudes that were known as
the Hayes brothers.
[SPEAKER_03]: He tried to introduce me to them actually
one time in California, and there's three
[SPEAKER_03]: circumstances of the meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't work out, but they created the
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mel Frank created or collected the Afghani
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he also gave him the turban
poison, which came from Ed Rosenthal,
[SPEAKER_03]: which Ed Rosenthal actually didn't collect
in South Africa, which is the common
[SPEAKER_03]: belief of the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ed got them out of some flowers at a
coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the truth about where Durbin
poison came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was out of seeds at a coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: The California orange, David also brought
that one to California, or sorry,
[SPEAKER_03]: to Holland, but he collected that one from
a grower at a harvest festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, you know, Dave is a member of the,
you know, the Seed Savers Club of America.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he is an insane collector of plant
seeds, not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what he, the story he told me is that
he met this grower up at a harvest
[SPEAKER_03]: festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had the California orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then seeds, there was no seed
business and they just didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but because David was an insane
collector, he said, Hey, do you mind if I
[SPEAKER_03]: get some of those seeds and can I work
with them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I breed them out and, and,
and play with them?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy gave them to him freely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he brought all those things over to,
to Holland, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's how the whole Sam, the skunk
band thing kind of started over in
[SPEAKER_03]: Holland, but everybody, I mean,
you look at Dutch passion, sense the,
[SPEAKER_03]: all their seed catalogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's pretty clear that David was
the person that brought all those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of them he created and some of
them he just ushered in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, he made a lot of hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I helped him catalog his entire
seed collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is to my knowledge, the largest
cannabis term pleasant collection on the
[SPEAKER_03]: planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I don't know anybody that has a
larger one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff in there that the
world doesn't even know about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just weird land races and weird plants,
you know, just with strange traits that
[SPEAKER_03]: people don't even think about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all, it's all there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I, I, I give credit all the
David for that, you know, and he's,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's more than willing to, you know,
he'll, he'll tell you straight up,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, these ones came from, from Al Frank.
[SPEAKER_03]: These ones came from so-and-so,
the Hayes brothers, the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Hayes isn't even, you know,
everybody says, oh, Hayes is if it's one
[SPEAKER_03]: thing, Hayes isn't one thing, it's many
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a series of plants that were created
over multiple generations being hybridized
[SPEAKER_03]: with one another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every year they would add in a new
cross into the mix, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So Hayes is really a family of siblings
and half siblings and cousins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's many, many different types of
the Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the purple Hayes, you know,
obviously the purple Hayes, there's all
[SPEAKER_03]: these red and green Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one that was called Christmas
Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was New Year's Hayes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They were super long flowering ones that
weren't ready until the new year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they all are different variations of
hybrids between Mexican, Thai,
[SPEAKER_03]: South Indian, and a little bit of Afghani
at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so many different avenues again,
to go into the most pertinent question to
[SPEAKER_00]: me is, did you ever get to try what some
might call the real Hayes, even though you
[SPEAKER_00]: just explained there is no one real Hayes,
but, you know, often people reminisce
[SPEAKER_00]: about Hayes, but can't exactly vouch that
they've been able to try verified real
[SPEAKER_00]: deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was your experience if so?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've tried a bunch of different
things from being over there, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and usually they're hybrids of plants that
were David shared with people that were
[SPEAKER_03]: over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, everybody's heard of
Neville's Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were, those were David's
non-preferred Hayes plants that he gave to
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville with the promise that Neville
wouldn't reproduce them pure, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, he said, take these things and
make hybrids of them fine, but please just
[SPEAKER_03]: don't make them pure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I'm selling them pure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as people are wanting to do,
they don't like to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll tell you anything to get it in
their hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once they've got it, it's a whole
different thing when they can make money
[SPEAKER_03]: off of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, they're, it's just a family of
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really what we know now is the Hayes
is are mostly like, you know, the amnesia
[SPEAKER_03]: Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what you find over in
Holland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are turpinoline plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're turpinoline dominant plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of in the same family as
train wreck or I think the DNA guys sell
[SPEAKER_03]: it as what do they call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like citrus skunk or lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's lemon skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But lemon skunk actually, everybody
thinks, oh, it's high in limonene.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, it's high in turpinoline,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And turpinoline to some people has a
little bit of a fresh lemon scent,
[SPEAKER_03]: even though it's, to me, it's more piney.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the, the pining plants,
which are a little more rare and the
[SPEAKER_03]: limonene pining plants as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they all kind of fall into that
Hayes-y family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like again, what I call equatorials,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you kind of just quickly alluded
to Neville in the mix there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been interested by the fact
that he was Don the moniker of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: king of Hayes is despite the fact he got
them from David.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like that was sort of like a
misnomer?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact he got that title and as a bit of
a follow-up, do you feel like NL5 Hayes is
[SPEAKER_00]: like a really good poster child for Hayes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think a lot of people suggest
that, you know, like the NL tames the
[SPEAKER_00]: Hayes to the point where it's like,
you can do it indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like there was actually a lot
better, but it just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it didn't really see the light of day sort
of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It made it more accessible for people to
grow, but I wouldn't call the NL5 Hayes
[SPEAKER_03]: like on its own Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you inbred it, you can pull out Hayes
like plants from it, but the NL5 Hayes is
[SPEAKER_03]: way too big for a Hayes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just got way too much biomass and
that's the influence of the Afganica in
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's, the Hayes are very,
like I said, they're very equatorial.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, they're very long flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very thin leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very low yield, small resin
glands.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have a ton of scent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they'd probably fail the 1% chirp
test.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least the old ones where they'd need to
be improved.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they did have a nice head space,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They did provide that nice clear kind of
effect and, and you know, what people call
[SPEAKER_03]: the ceiling where you could, or ceiling
lists where you can keep consuming them
[SPEAKER_03]: and getting higher and higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think again, it's like, because they
weren't 25% THC and you could smoke them
[SPEAKER_03]: without burning out, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: THC is by, it's got a biphasic effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at small doses it's invigorating,
but at large doses it's, it makes you
[SPEAKER_03]: lethargic and kind of feel like,
I don't know, I don't know if there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: better word for it than thud.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it just kind of like,
it just kind of like takes it out of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you've ever done large doses of
edibles, I mean, it's kind of a similar
[SPEAKER_03]: feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we see that not only in humans,
but also in rats.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you look at the neuroscience
of cannabinoids and administration,
[SPEAKER_03]: at a certain point in time, people,
you know, you get energetic on a curve and
[SPEAKER_03]: you get to a point where it plateaus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the more you consume,
you're actually going down, not getting up
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, how do you feel the comparison
between Neville and David is given that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think a lot of the time, and I'm probably
guilty of this myself, people hold Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: in a bit higher regard or maybe feel he
may be contributing more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like that's maybe inaccurate
and what's your thoughts on Neville in
[SPEAKER_00]: general?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I say, don't speak ill of the dead?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville is a controversial person in the
cannabis world, let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he took some risks that David wouldn't
risk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you remember David's American,
Neville's Australian.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when David moved to Holland,
you know, he knew that the United States
[SPEAKER_03]: was a machine, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that there were all these systems in
the United States that were part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that if you wanted to stick,
if you wanted to throw a stick in the
[SPEAKER_03]: wrenches of the operation of the American
machine, that they're going to come for
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so David never did any business and
once he left, he didn't, he wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in doing business in the States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville did, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville set up someone in the States and I
was actually doing distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mind saying this now that he's
passed, but you know, he actually set up
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were shipping them over from Holland
in like think soup containers,
[SPEAKER_03]: labeled soup cans, and they had someone
that was actually distributing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the money would come from the States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville would collect the money and then
the seeds would be shipped back out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why the DEA went after Neville
because something happened and the plot
[SPEAKER_03]: became known and they went for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was a smart guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I actually didn't know him too well
personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to interact with him a couple of
times and he was, let's say he wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: receptive to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But same with, you know, same with Scott.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have a really great relationship
with Scott.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a lot of respect for the work that
Scott has done, Shanty Baba, I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: for Mr. Nice Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for some reason, people want to be
divisive in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like they kind of put themselves
either in the Scott camp or the Neville
[SPEAKER_03]: camp or the David camp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're in one camp, then you can't
be friends with everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I, you know, I try to be friends with
everybody in the space because it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: they're all, they've all got interesting
histories and they've all got lessons to
[SPEAKER_03]: teach.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to understand the plant
from their perspective because I mean,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're our elders, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so George Cervantes actually
introduced me to Scott.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Scott was kind of apprehensive
of me at first because he was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, you're that Chimera guy and you know,
you're in the other camp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, we got past that pretty
quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: He came to realize that I, you know,
I wasn't any threat to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't, I had no malice towards him at
all.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I respected him for the works
that he had done.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we developed a kind of a mutual
respect thing, but he had really been
[SPEAKER_03]: poisoned by Neville, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause Neville had said it had told him all
these awful stories about, about David
[SPEAKER_03]: that just weren't true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he, and he used to tell me,
oh yeah, but he works in the DEA and he
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't look like Scott, dude,
that's just not, that's not the way it is,
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, so I think that,
you know, and, and truthfully,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you probably know Mr. Nice seed
company, which at one point in time was
[SPEAKER_03]: Neville and Scott that, that kind of went,
you know, Neville towards the end,
[SPEAKER_03]: he wasn't involved with it anymore,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, they had parted ways a bit too,
because, well, just because of stuff that
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to get into, but I think
that the internet with the internet,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially, you know, the cannabis
community for a period of time existed
[SPEAKER_03]: only on the internet, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We couldn't interact with each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: One-to-one on person and the internet,
the internet and overgrow and all these
[SPEAKER_03]: other websites that we use to use,
you know, cannabis roll, all that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They provided an opportunity for people to
reach out and connect with each other in a
[SPEAKER_03]: way that we couldn't do before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it just, those technologies didn't
exist and it was a really great thing for
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the really bad thing about it was that
there's just, there's become all this
[SPEAKER_03]: nonsense stories that people have made and
promulgated.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can go to Wikipedia and read
about a whole bunch of nonsense about
[SPEAKER_03]: David on the Wikipedia stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's somehow fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for whatever reason, those things have
really resonated in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: community, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, we're so, as a whole,
we're so anti-science.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're so anti-big pharma.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're against the man, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, we've been kicked in the
teeth by the police and the justice system
[SPEAKER_03]: for 50, 60 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's natural that we have all those,
those fears, but I think in, on the
[SPEAKER_03]: internet forums, they really fester into
this, like, psychotic, untrusting place of
[SPEAKER_03]: like, really what just becomes mostly
lies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I read stuff on the internet
that I know for a fact didn't go down that
[SPEAKER_03]: way because I was there, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm reading it on the internet as if
it's fact by some guy posting it as if
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like gospel from God's mouth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a way, while the internet really
helped us get the seeds out and spread the
[SPEAKER_03]: message and teach people how to grow and
even teaching people how to breathe and
[SPEAKER_03]: some more advanced stuff about cannabis,
there's been a lot of negativity that's
[SPEAKER_03]: come out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, you know, I think frustrates,
I know it frustrates a lot of the old
[SPEAKER_03]: timers and myself included.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it gets to the point where it's just
like, you don't even want to do it
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you don't want to post and share the
information because all you're met with is
[SPEAKER_03]: people telling you that you're a liar and
that you work with the DEA or that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's just all this nonsense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really, it's kind of a shame
because it's done a disservice to the
[SPEAKER_03]: history of cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've, I've always, when I've been
over in Europe and I've tried to meet all
[SPEAKER_03]: these different folks in the industry,
I really just want to meet them all and
[SPEAKER_03]: understand, but what their perspectives
are for cannabis, because I'm interested
[SPEAKER_03]: in the history.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I guess kind of like we're doing
with this talk now, but I'm interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: the history and the reasons why people
were doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the motivations and how they got their
start.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been in the cannabis industry,
a lot of smoke and mirrors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really hope that that goes away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're going to see the next
generation of people that are,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're able to be open and honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're able to show their work.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're able to teach the next generation
how to do it better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I really do feel like quite hopeful
for cannabis and positive for cannabis in
[SPEAKER_03]: the next 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really look forward to, you know,
I was talking to a friend from England the
[SPEAKER_03]: other day and Guernsey, one of the little
islands off in the South sea or Southern,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever it's called the, what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bay of the Bay of Biscay.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all, you know, they're talking
about legalizing a full adult use model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just off the coast of England,
they're a British colony or protectorate
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever it is, but I'd love to see
them legalize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to see Australia and you know,
New Zealand legalize.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really have to see the whole
Commonwealth just legalized straight off
[SPEAKER_03]: the bat.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be a nice quick start.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the rest of the world will
eventually catch on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that's going to be great
for so many reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll probably lessen the impact that
alcohol, the negative impacts that alcohol
[SPEAKER_03]: bar have on society.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's just so many benefits that can
come with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know all about the medical
aspects and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm not going to sit here and
preach to the converted, but it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, cannabis can do a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of benefit for society.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've seen this with the,
you know, the British soccer hooligans
[SPEAKER_03]: that used to go, you know, they'd go to
different countries and there'd always be
[SPEAKER_03]: these brawls and fights with everybody
getting drunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they'd play Amsterdam or they'd
play Holland in Amsterdam, that wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: happen because everybody was stoned,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of good that can come
from cannabis and societies using
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would be great to see a lot of
Neville's work being grown down in
[SPEAKER_03]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Australia has got a great climate
for these equatorial plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a shame that it's, you know,
they're still throwing people in jail
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many points resonating with what you
just said, but I feel like it is such a
[SPEAKER_00]: shame that we do still have this kind of
culture in the scene of like being
[SPEAKER_00]: attached to one camp and you can't just
kind of try to be okay with everyone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because as you've alluded to,
that's through being able to kind of float
[SPEAKER_00]: in between the rifts, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's how the truth can come
out and you can avoid these sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned with Scott thinking
that Dave was a part of the DEA and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of sad that the three,
arguably the three big pillars in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: like Scott, Neville and Dave weren't able
to kind of keep it all together because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of this fragmentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of thing you alluded to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to jump back to Dave for one
moment, something which has been asked
[SPEAKER_00]: probably more so than any other question
about him, which I would love to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective on, is did he ever talk to you
about his thoughts and whether he
[SPEAKER_00]: intentionally ever changed Skunk from what
people would say was like the stinky early
[SPEAKER_00]: version to the suite?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, what's your overall perspective
on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he loved the suite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's just what he loved.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the end of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first few generations, it had some
stanky plants in there, but those weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: the ones that he preferred.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like all breeders do, they select
towards the type that they like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta keep in mind the context of the
years too that was going on, like late
[SPEAKER_03]: 70s, early 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: We call it mid to late 70s, early 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grow Skunkweed back then, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to jail, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you're stinking out the whole
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he selected away from that and that
was just part of his choice because he
[SPEAKER_03]: liked the resins from these other plants
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: They made what he considered a finer hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: David, since many, many, many years ago,
is not a cannabis flower consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a hash and concentrate consumer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he used to have the finest hash in the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: What everybody called the 50, and it was
like 50% plus THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would turn to liquid as soon as you put
a flame to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the first dabble concentrate
extract that I'd ever seen before dabs
[SPEAKER_03]: were even a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had that level of quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, he selected the plants that he
liked for that purpose and that's what he
[SPEAKER_03]: did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why Skunk is the way it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody talks about the turps in Skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually not a turpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's rare volatiles that the plant
produces that have to do with smell or
[SPEAKER_03]: they influence smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so turpenes, everybody thinks that
turpenes is the whole story but they're
[SPEAKER_03]: actually not.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're one of the major factors in the
scent but there are a few other chemicals
[SPEAKER_03]: that when they get mixed in with these
turpenes, they're kind of like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I call them scent or flavor modifiers,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they actually use some of these
compounds in the perfume industry to
[SPEAKER_03]: change the flavors of, or sorry,
to change the sense of different perfumes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the community at the moment,
there's this really kind of popular drive
[SPEAKER_00]: to find the road kill Skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: My thoughts are that it's most likely
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And touching on a point you just made,
some of the smells around this sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: quote roadkill Skunk, I've got to believe
that they're kind of more thiol-based,
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur-based compounds and maybe not even
technically falling under the strict
[SPEAKER_00]: definition of a turpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's the case or do you
think that the other point of view might
[SPEAKER_00]: have some credence to it where it's that
there's a bit of like rose shade glasses
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe it wasn't really like a Skunk
dead down the road sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you sit on that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll tell you a story that might
tell you, I've got a plant that is very,
[SPEAKER_03]: very roadkill-like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a few of them actually,
but one of them is a turpinoline dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's actually of the same flavor
profile or what we call the flavor class.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a flavor class is like, they have a
general turpene profile arrangement that
[SPEAKER_03]: is kind of a fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's like all these different
plants that kind of fall into that
[SPEAKER_03]: grouping.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this particular plant is a
turpinoline plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so up close and it's right in your
nose, it's got that lemon skunk kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like, we have a product here called Mr.
Clean Pine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you have that in
Australia, but it's a concentrated liquid
[SPEAKER_03]: cleaner that you add to water to wash the
floors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's got this, that's a turpinoline
kind of smell to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you have the flowers and they're
up close and you're breaking it up,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's what you smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I remember harvesting a couple of
rooms of this stuff and I was moving it
[SPEAKER_03]: across town in my bed in my knapsack and
there was something going on with my car
[SPEAKER_03]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I decided I was going to get on the
bus and go across town with these bags of
[SPEAKER_03]: dope in my knapsack all sealed up really
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got on the front of the bus and
walked to the back, halfway to the back of
[SPEAKER_03]: the bus, essentially got to the backs of
the doors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember someone just saying,
do you smell that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It reeks like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just promptly got off the bus and
walked home across town rather than taking
[SPEAKER_03]: the bus.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the point of the story is that the
smell that you smell when it's right up
[SPEAKER_03]: close is different than the smell that you
smell when it's in the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, you'd come into a room and you'd
open it up and it would be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it smells like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does have a reminiscent nose of a
skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you actually get it out and you
grind it up, it doesn't, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I know there's going to be a
hundred people online telling me that I
[SPEAKER_03]: have no idea what I'm talking about and
that know the stuff that they had.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was those skunk right down to the end
of the joint and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it was, maybe it was just tiring
these compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that, you know, I know for a
fact in having had access to these
[SPEAKER_03]: chemicals to make terpene standards and
things, when you have a molecule at one
[SPEAKER_03]: drop versus, you know, one, like for
example, say you've got one molecule or
[SPEAKER_03]: one microliter of a substance and you put
it on a piece of paper and you take the
[SPEAKER_03]: same substance and you put 10 times as
much on a different piece of paper,
[SPEAKER_03]: they smell different, same substance,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's something to do with like,
like maybe like with that, with THC and
[SPEAKER_03]: the biphasic response that we also have
these responses in our nose, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That like, you know, one molecule of a
smelly compound is enough to trigger a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain effect in your nose and more,
it might elicit a different response.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, knowing that each of us have
different neurochemistry and smell is also
[SPEAKER_03]: based on neurochemistry, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a chemical signal that's being
transferred to your brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so yeah, I think it's, it's,
it's partly something to do with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know what the true answer is,
but there's something in that whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's always something to,
you know, nostalgia, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The weed that you had that one time when
you were with your best friend at the
[SPEAKER_03]: lake, it's like those things all influence
your perception of the experience,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hugely, hugely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And looking back on it, it's pretty easy
to say, no, no, that was skunk weed,
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not like a skunk,
but I bet you if you were able to
[SPEAKER_03]: transport someone back in time and make
them smell the same thing that they
[SPEAKER_03]: wouldn't smell the same thing again,
like, you know, I don't know if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: interested, if you like beer or anything,
but I know when I was a kid, beer used to
[SPEAKER_03]: me, it used to smell like skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't smell like skunk to me now,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because that I've learned to
appreciate the different notes that exist
[SPEAKER_03]: within the context.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same with weed, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like part of, part of smelling things is
like knowing how to break apart the
[SPEAKER_03]: effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, you're not smelling one
chemical, you're smelling a symphony of
[SPEAKER_03]: chemicals, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the total of those, it like a symphony
of musical notes, like the totality of the
[SPEAKER_03]: orchestra is what makes the sound.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not listening to the flute,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the oboe, for example, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the totality of the whole thing
together that you hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And being able to train your ear,
you know, in the context of a symphony,
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to train your ear to pick out
the oboe or the bass guitar or whatever it
[SPEAKER_03]: is, like that takes a little bit of a
skill and training and time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the same thing with your nose and
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when we smell cannabis, we're
smelling this orchestra of molecules that
[SPEAKER_03]: come together, that come together to
create what we perceive as an experience,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you, when you have the individual
chemicals at your disposal and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: smell limonene on its own or osamine on
its own or beta-karyophyllene or rock and
[SPEAKER_03]: list, you know, any one of the really 30
major terms that are in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: then we have a language that we can agree
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for example, you know, if we're
sitting in a park and we look up at the
[SPEAKER_03]: sky, you and I can both point at the sky
and say, okay, that's blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we agree?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: The clouds are white.
[SPEAKER_03]: The leaves on the grass or the leaves,
you know, in the grass or on the trees are
[SPEAKER_03]: green.
[SPEAKER_03]: That flower is yellow, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can have a shared experience
because we're both looking at the same
[SPEAKER_03]: thing and then we're applying a label to
that thing that we're looking at,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have that ability with terpenes
or with scents without having the
[SPEAKER_03]: individual chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why people say stuff like,
oh, it smells incency or it smells like
[SPEAKER_03]: roses or it smells like, you know,
X, Y, or Z, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The rose actually smells like geraniol,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the lavender smells like linalool,
but we don't know what those individual
[SPEAKER_03]: components smell like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's hard for us to have that consensus
where we point to one thing and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And only when you actually get the
individual terpenes or the individual
[SPEAKER_03]: notes on their own, can you then,
we can then both share the same vial and
[SPEAKER_03]: smell it, you know, in a socially
distancing manner.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can both share it and say, okay,
this is linalool.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is limonene.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is osamine or whatever
terpene you want to choose.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people are always blown away
when I show them pure limonene.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, it doesn't smell like
lemons.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it doesn't smell like lemons.
[SPEAKER_03]: It smells like orange peels.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everybody assumes it smells like
lemons, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bottle of limonene in my fridge
and I do the same little thing to people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's great because then,
and what's that that's about is building a
[SPEAKER_03]: consensus of the words that we use to
describe these things, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Rather than trying to describe them by
referring to some other thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which again, is it's on itself like it's
like, oh, it smells like roses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, roses are also a symphony of smell,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a symphony of notes that make up
the overall scent that we perceive as one
[SPEAKER_03]: thing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so until you have the ability to learn
the individual components of that smell,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really hard to communicate on things
because we just we don't have a common
[SPEAKER_03]: language like that, like we do for colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, just a point you touched
on, which I really struggled to try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through to people at times is how like
chemicals at different concentrations have
[SPEAKER_00]: different smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I try to make it simple to
understand by talking about like ozone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the smell after rain,
Petrure, like it's sweet in low
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you get a big jar of ozone,
it smells horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I guess it is a bit of a concept
to wrap your head around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to jump into some more kind of
technical breeding stuff at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think that's an area you're
going to be able to provide a really great
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of insight into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I've always wondered about is I
think it might have been a forum post,
[SPEAKER_00]: but somewhere along the line, Dave wrote
an article about how he reversed some
[SPEAKER_00]: males and got female seeds out of got
seeds out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 25% of those seeds were females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you ever consider doing this sort of
project if, say, you only had one male and
[SPEAKER_00]: you wanted to lie and breed it out and get
some females out of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it's just too much of an
effort?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not too much of an effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually not that hard to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no harder than or no different,
really, than making feminized seeds with
[SPEAKER_03]: STS.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some there's some challenges in
working with the populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you got to understand about the
plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: To be perfectly frank, they need to bring
it all to cut around the whole discussion
[SPEAKER_03]: and go right to the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, and this might be controversial
to some people, I think that male cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: plants in the drug breeding world are
probably on their way out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you make all female seeds or gynosia
seeds, I don't like to use the word
[SPEAKER_03]: feminized, but if you use gynosia seeds
right and you make them right,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're every bit as good as regular
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, they're better than regular
seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a couple of reasons, the obvious
reason that in your next generation you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have to worry about dealing with a
bunch of males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truthfully, if you're growing out 1,000
plants and 500 of them are males,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a big waste of time and space.
[SPEAKER_03]: The resources to pull them out,
even if you're using genetic sequencing or
[SPEAKER_03]: PCR-based method to identify the males at
the beginning, that's a cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not free to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs money to plant them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs time to plant them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs money in terms of nutrients and
soil and space in your grow room and all
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, males are a big hassle to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I work with male populations,
but if I do, I typically don't do
[SPEAKER_03]: one-to-one breedings with males unless the
plant has some incredible unique trait
[SPEAKER_03]: that I can't do it another way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually what I'll do is I'll combine the
pollen from a percentage of the
[SPEAKER_03]: population, call it 10 to 15%,
of the plants that I determine or I
[SPEAKER_03]: believe are the most suitable for whatever
that population is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'll mix the pollen or use those
plants all together in the same room.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really the natural way that
cannabis breeds in a natural stand.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you call it 30,000 years ago,
if you're walking through the Tibetan
[SPEAKER_03]: Plateau and you find a stand of cannabis,
you're not going to find one female
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to find a group of plants
many males and many females, and the males
[SPEAKER_03]: are pollinating all the females.
[SPEAKER_03]: That natural state of breeding is what we
call out-crossing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually called an obligate
out-crosser.
[SPEAKER_03]: An obligate out-crosser is a plant that
needs another individual from a different
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic type, maybe a brother or sister,
but maybe another plant far away,
[SPEAKER_03]: to cross, to hybridize, to make off.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a consequence of having a dioecious
population where you have males and
[SPEAKER_03]: females.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot more akin to the way that
humans breed, where humans also need to
[SPEAKER_03]: have sex with another individual to be
able to leave offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't clone yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't just have kids willy-nilly
unless you're the Virgin Mary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody else has to breed together to
make offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a genetic consequence to that,
meaning that the child is actually a
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid of two different parental types.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got a mother and a father.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've got brothers and
sisters, but if you look at your family,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't look like your mother or your
father.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't look like your father.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a sister, she doesn't look
exactly like your mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have some traits of both the parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't look like your siblings unless
you're twins.
[SPEAKER_03]: That state of breeding is really much more
similar to cannabis than, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're growing an heirloom tomato
variety, you can plant a seed,
[SPEAKER_03]: grow it into a plant, harvest the fruit,
take the seeds out of the fruit,
[SPEAKER_03]: plant those again the next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fruit from that subsequent year are
going to look like the year before and the
[SPEAKER_03]: year before.
[SPEAKER_03]: For 10, 20 generations down into the
future, the tomato is going to keep coming
[SPEAKER_03]: out looking the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis isn't like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason it's not like that is because
when you constantly breed to another type,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're constantly introducing new genetic
material into the mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're losing some genetic material every
time, but you're also gaining new stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have this uniformity that starts
to develop in plants like tomato that are
[SPEAKER_03]: what we call self-crossers or
self-species, selfing species or
[SPEAKER_03]: inbreeding species.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those types of species get to be more
homogeneous and more uniform over time
[SPEAKER_03]: because their breeding system actually
purges genetic variation rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: increases the genetic variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: From a breeding perspective, it's actually
a lot more work with cannabis to make
[SPEAKER_03]: things uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: Through some of the work that I've done
down in the States, especially having
[SPEAKER_03]: access to the chemical to the laboratory
where we would grow hundreds of plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: every single plant would go to the
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would get back not only the phenotypic
data that we would collect during the
[SPEAKER_03]: grow, you'd also get the chemical data
from the laboratory.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would be able to take two plants that
had a very similar character or an
[SPEAKER_03]: identical terpene profile and we'd cross
those together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas if you took plants with divergent
terpene profiles and you cross them
[SPEAKER_03]: together, you wouldn't have the same level
of uniformity in the offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because male cannabis plants don't produce
the traits of interest or even of import
[SPEAKER_03]: to drug cannabis growers, you don't use
male plants in growing drug cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You only use them for making seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use this expression and some people
don't like when I use it but I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: use it anyway because I don't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're breeding humans for breast size,
it's pretty easy to select the female
[SPEAKER_03]: humans that have big breasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you select a male individual for
big breasts?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have that characteristic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what we call a sex-linked trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only one gender really shows those
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were running a human breeding
program, which we can't do because of
[SPEAKER_03]: ethics, but if you were running a human
breeding program, you would probably look
[SPEAKER_03]: at male plants that had sisters with large
breasts or mothers with large breasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: That increases the probability that
they'll have the genes for large breasts
[SPEAKER_03]: but it doesn't guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas when you're selecting two females
and you can find a way to cross two
[SPEAKER_03]: females together like we have done with
creating feminized seeds, you can do what
[SPEAKER_03]: I call positive selection for the traits
of interest on both sides of the cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you can do that, trust me because
I've done it in the laboratory many times,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you bring two types together that are
almost identical, the chances of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants being more uniform are way,
way higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I've noticed is that you make more
genetic progress in a generation when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also have the added benefit of not
having to remove males from your
[SPEAKER_03]: subsequent population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, if you've got hundreds or
even thousands of plants, having to go
[SPEAKER_03]: through and rogue out half your crop or
kill half your crop, that really is a
[SPEAKER_03]: pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real, real inconvenience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, gosh, so many avenues to go
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something just to kind of follow on with
that is there's long been a discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: within the community about whether there's
any realistic significance between,
[SPEAKER_00]: say, a feminized seed produced from
intentional STS application versus one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just purely a result of maybe a
stressed environment, some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite genetic event.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that there is some sort of
difference or that they're fundamentally
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's both.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't tell you it's the same one or the
other, but it's actually both.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me put it this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to think of how to put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a basic tenet as a breeders,
but it applies to plants, but it also
[SPEAKER_03]: applies to animal breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that tenet is like begets like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all that means is the plants that you
you select as parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's very likely that the traits that
you selected for in those parents are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to reoccur in the next generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, and so if you're using a plant that
that goes intersex again, hermaphrodite is
[SPEAKER_03]: not a it's not technically a real world
word for plants, because a hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_03]: flower would be a man would be a one
single flower that had male parts and
[SPEAKER_03]: female parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not what happens with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have flower clusters that have male and
single female flowers together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's really called intersex,
not hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hermaphrodite would be if it was half a
male flower and half a female flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So intersex is the proper term for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so intersex plants, they have,
like you said, some either genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: predisposition to have both sexes on the
same plant or.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the case that you mentioned,
under a specific grow room stress or
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental stress, they produce male
flowers, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you use those plants that produce
male flowers under that given stress,
[SPEAKER_03]: like begets like the next generation are
going to be more likely to be predisposed
[SPEAKER_03]: to making male flowers given that stress
appears.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so by using plants like you said,
that are maybe like late flowering this
[SPEAKER_03]: way, Dutch Passion used to do it and Soma
kind of does it this way as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call it rotalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you use these plants, these plants
that are producing intersex flowers either
[SPEAKER_03]: late in the cycle or due to a pH
fluctuation or light cycle fluctuation or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever it is that throws off the
hormonal balance in the plant that makes
[SPEAKER_03]: it produce male flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you select, if you positively select
those traits, those traits are going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: more likely to be present in the next
generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all that says is intersex plants
are going to have a higher likelihood of
[SPEAKER_03]: making intersex offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas if you select plants that don't
have those intersex characteristics and
[SPEAKER_03]: then you create, you use, you know,
STS or silver thiosolvate, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: to force those plants to produce male
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next generation of plants are going to
be less likely.
[SPEAKER_03]: To produce intersex flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so everybody will typically the
cannabis community, you know, whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: look for the short easy explanations and
it's like the explanation everybody comes
[SPEAKER_03]: to is, oh, we sprayed this chemical on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next generation had intersex
offspring.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the chemical that's doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a wrong conclusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, it's the thing is, is that they
selected a plant that has a higher
[SPEAKER_03]: likelihood to go intersex and that trait
is amplified in the next generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, so yeah, they are very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to use plants that are
likely to produce intersex flowers as
[SPEAKER_03]: parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, because again, like begets like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those, the progeny from those,
those parents are going to be more likely
[SPEAKER_03]: to be intersex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that I've long
suspected and tried to explain to people
[SPEAKER_00]: that like fundamentally at its core,
cannabis is a plant which doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: discrete sexes, you know, it's it's
actually both at the same time and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: just bred it from like this menaceous sort
of plant to try to be more diecious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my question is, do you think
we'll ever get to a point where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: bred cannabis selectively enough that we
more or less don't see any expression of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other sex in the in the say a female
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it's it's almost
genetically impossible?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not genetically impossible in
any given plant because we have lots of
[SPEAKER_03]: plants that don't go intersex.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's it's like it's it's a
continuum, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at one end of the spectrum,
there's plants that don't go intersex at
[SPEAKER_03]: all.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the other end of spectrum, there's
plants that are completely like you said,
[SPEAKER_03]: menacious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would disagree with you in saying that
they don't that there are discrete genders
[SPEAKER_03]: in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's discrete genders and then there's
females that are intersex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can have a female plant that is
female but intersex and you can have a
[SPEAKER_03]: female plant that is female but not
intersex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do understand the the genetic basis now
of of gender in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's yeah, it's almost it's it's
almost 100 percent sure that we're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the plant world, you know,
you know what it's like in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's exceptions to every rule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's there's human children that
are born intersex, right, that they have
[SPEAKER_03]: some gender from each the X and the Y
chromosome they undergo crossing over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's genetic material exchange
between the male and the female.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can have males that don't have the
you're going to have genetically male
[SPEAKER_03]: people with Y chromosomes that have female
reproductive parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have female people with two X
chromosomes and no Y chromosome and they
[SPEAKER_03]: have male reproductive parts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's always going to be exceptions
to every rule when it comes to biology.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that, yeah, as a whole in
the species, we'll never get rid of
[SPEAKER_03]: intersexuality because it's part of the
the thing that's coded into the species.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want to grow one of the easiest
easy ways to do it is to grow plants and
[SPEAKER_03]: select clones that don't go intersex and
then use those plants for your production.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think over time and a proper breeding
program, and now that we're starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: get access to genomics, genomic companies
that can support cannabis breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: programs, that we will be able to identify
genetic markers related to intersexuality
[SPEAKER_03]: and we'll be able to select against those
markers and create populations that are
[SPEAKER_03]: much more resistant to intersexuality.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's part of our process and part of
our our learning experience that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to have to go through over the next,
you know, like I said, however long,
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Funnily enough, all female breeding is
probably going to be the way that we will
[SPEAKER_03]: do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, again, when you're selecting
males, unless you have genetic markers,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's very difficult to tell whether that
plant has will be intersex.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, again, the males don't show that
characteristic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you select for or against the
characteristic in males that you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: see?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in fact, using two female plants that
are highly resistant to intersexuality,
[SPEAKER_03]: that might be how we breed out the
intersexuality.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is maybe seems counterintuitive to
some people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that, you know, there's a lot of
people, again, it's kind of a trait in our
[SPEAKER_03]: community that it's like everybody wants
it to be as natural as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not the way that cannabis evolved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, truthfully, the cannabis that you're
smoking today is nothing like the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: that humans first encountered.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the cannabis that humans first
encountered was a tall, the short little
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that probably produced very little
flower and a few seeds and no discernible
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid content or terpene content.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly not what is comparable to
today's modern hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you want to be, if you're like
kind of hippie minded and anti-science and
[SPEAKER_03]: you want everything to be natural,
organic, you know, the way Mother Nature
[SPEAKER_03]: intended, you're probably not going to be
supportive of female female breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that if you're serious about
breeding cannabis for its chemistry,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is what we do as drug cannabis
breeders, that it's really kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: undeniable that the effects that you can
get, sorry, the progress that you can make
[SPEAKER_03]: using female plants or only female
populations, it's pretty significant if
[SPEAKER_03]: you actually use a lab and screen the
samples, you know, from male female
[SPEAKER_03]: crosses and female female crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think most people would be surprised of
the differences in the amount of genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: gain that you can make in a generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truthfully, some female female crosses
don't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of females, they contain
intersex genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you self them or when you cross
them to other female plants, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: you get a lot of, um, intersexuality in
some lines, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not everywhere, but it does happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you just, you either do your best
to pull those intersexuality traits out or
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't use that line.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I said this last week on,
on a couple of weeks ago on Shango's
[SPEAKER_03]: podcast, but you don't, you know,
in the plant breeding world, not every up,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't step up to bat every time and
hit a home run, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of fail failures.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might fail 90% of the time,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's okay because breeding plants is
about taking the best of the best of the
[SPEAKER_03]: best, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're taking the cream from the crop,
um, and using those to for the next
[SPEAKER_03]: generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so it's okay if things don't work
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just means that you don't work those
lines, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you work them a different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you, you focus on the ones that do
work, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another, another one of David's
quotes.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I love killing plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I love killing cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, that's how you, that's how
you make them better.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to get rid of all the junk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 150% on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people are sometimes a bit too
attached to plants to realize when maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not worth keeping around just to
extend on a kind of idea you touched on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember one of the ideas DJ mentioned
when we had a chat with him was that he
[SPEAKER_00]: always had this sneaking suspicion that
males, which showed intersex traits might
[SPEAKER_00]: be of more value than just what you would
call a male that doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any sort of speculation on
maybe where that might come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if there's any maybe validity to that,
if you've seen that or toyed with intersex
[SPEAKER_00]: males at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So David and David also has talked a lot
about this with Hayes and apparently Hayes
[SPEAKER_03]: is, you know, throws like easy,
he claims up to 75% of the population are
[SPEAKER_03]: females.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a much higher ratio, sex ratio,
which is bizarre because it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_03]: fit our scientific understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: What DJ is talking about, I think there's
probably a scientific basis for what he's
[SPEAKER_03]: noticed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if you've looked into how
the silver silver thiosulfate chemical
[SPEAKER_03]: that we use for, for creating male flowers
on female plants, what it does is it
[SPEAKER_03]: blocks a receptor in the plant called the
ethylene receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ethylene is one of five major plant
hormones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, in, in humans we have, you know,
you'd probably know more than I,
[SPEAKER_03]: but with your background, but there's,
we have lots and lots of, um, of hormones,
[SPEAKER_03]: many hormones that do many different
things in the plant world.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really five major ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and one of those is ethylene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people might heard of this trick
with either avocados or bananas.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you, if you had a green banana and you
take it and you put it in a paper bag and
[SPEAKER_03]: cinch the top of the paper bag,
the banana will go ripe yellow more
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly than say one open sitting on the
counter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason is, is that when bananas
mature, they give off this gas called
[SPEAKER_03]: ethylene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ethylene causes the banana ripen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also causes plants to, to, uh,
it also causes plant flowers to open and
[SPEAKER_03]: bloom.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you're able to block that
receptor, the ethylene can't do its job.
[SPEAKER_03]: So think of it like Narcan or naloxone,
the anti-opioid drug, the drug that all
[SPEAKER_03]: the police carry now to give to heroin
people that are overdosing from heroin,
[SPEAKER_03]: that molecule blocks the heroin receptor
or the opioid receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And therefore the fentanyl can't bind to
the receptor and cause all the downstream
[SPEAKER_03]: problems that it does shortness of breath
and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so when we do that with the silver
thiosulfate or silver nitrate,
[SPEAKER_03]: the silver molecule actually blocks the
ethylene receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we shut down that biological
pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were turning off the effect of that,
um, of that hormone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we do that in cannabis,
the plant produces male flowers rather
[SPEAKER_03]: than female flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a simple one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, one hormone receptor pathway,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Conversely, if you take a male plant and
you spray it with a chemical called
[SPEAKER_03]: ethyphon, ethyphon is a chemical that is
absorbed by the plant and it breaks down
[SPEAKER_03]: into ethylene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you spray a female plant with this
ethyphon chemical, you're introducing more
[SPEAKER_03]: ethylene into the plant and the male plant
will produce female flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what you were talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you asked about David making,
um, selfs or, or hybrids or reversing
[SPEAKER_03]: males, as you call it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so really it's about playing with this
one pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Coincidentally, I mean, we were talking
about flowers opening and maturing and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, really there's this arc in
ethylene production over the flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis probably goes through that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think anybody's really
measured that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually quite hard to measure
ethylene because it's a, it occurs in such
[SPEAKER_03]: minute quantities in the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, like ethylene probably
cycles the levels of the plant of the,
[SPEAKER_03]: of that hormone probably cycle throughout
the hormones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that actually could be very well be
why we have a males or some plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: are predisposed to throw male flowers at
the end of the cycle, because there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: change in the ethylene expression in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, it's just interesting to know that
that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and it's likely that what you're
talking about with DJ is that like humans
[SPEAKER_03]: and like cannabis does and all these other
traits, there's variation in the levels of
[SPEAKER_03]: these chemicals that the plant produces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some plant, some genetic backgrounds might
have low levels of ethylene, but some
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, maybe they produce a lot of
ethylene, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if a plant produced a lot of ethylene,
you might have a male plant that would
[SPEAKER_03]: show a female flower because it again,
excess ethylene to the plant changes the
[SPEAKER_03]: phenotype a little bit and makes it
produce female flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that could very well be what DJ is
talking about is that he's actually
[SPEAKER_03]: unconsciously selecting plants that have a
really high ethylene load.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as such, they're more feminine males.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a brilliant answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you, you also answered my next
question, which was going to be about
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders claiming that their seeds have a
higher proportion of females and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perfectly answered that the following
question was going to be, I've always kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of thought that this idea that I'm about
to talk about was kind of incorrect,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you would hear some breeders talk
about how, you know, germinating seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: hot environments will give you more males,
things like that seems counterintuitive to
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea that the sex of the plant is
largely genetically based.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, although there could be some sort
of like epigenetic genetic change,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on like after the
seeds been produced factors, which could
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to the ratio of sex upon
germination or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's just put the sex conversation
just to the side for a quick moment and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and have a conversation about population
sizes and statistics, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a population of a hundred
people, call it label them one to a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: On any given trait, say that they're tall,
small, the smallest guy is one,
[SPEAKER_03]: the largest guy is a hundred and there's
one of each.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's literally, you know,
one, two, three, four, five, all the way
[SPEAKER_03]: up to a hundred.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you then go into that popular,
you put them all on a paper bag and you
[SPEAKER_03]: reach your hand and you pull out three at
random.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might get like, say, say, say
whatever, you don't shake up the bag very
[SPEAKER_03]: well and you put your hand in after and
you, you, you pull out numbers 96,
[SPEAKER_03]: 97 and 95, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you add the three up and you take the
average and you decide, okay, 96 is the
[SPEAKER_03]: average of this population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're going to be wrong,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the small subset of the plants
that you've looked at doesn't match the
[SPEAKER_03]: overall population.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something in statistics we call
sampling error.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people can Google that if they want,
but there's a whole field of math about
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of the results that we
see in the cannabis world is that people
[SPEAKER_03]: are actually not doing proper sampling or
they're not growing large enough
[SPEAKER_03]: populations upon which to make the
conclusions that they're making.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when we do this kind of stuff,
when you talk about, um, males and
[SPEAKER_03]: females, there's a really basic science
thing, um, that we use and it's called the
[SPEAKER_03]: Chi squares test is it's spelled C H I
dash square.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can, you can look that up,
but the Chi square test essentially is
[SPEAKER_03]: your observed result minus your expected
result.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over your expected results.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, that gives you a number that you
can look up on a table and you can base on
[SPEAKER_03]: the number of plants that you're growing
and seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for example, you know, we would
expect that 10 regular seeds, five of them
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to be male and five are going to
be female.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you grew out a population of a
hundred, you'd probably end up seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: like, Oh look, there's 47 males and 53
females or vice versa or something close
[SPEAKER_03]: to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the larger the population you grow,
the more close to 50 50 you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you grow three plants, each it's
like flipping a coin three times,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You might get, you might get heads three
times by flipping a coin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, does that mean that every time you
flip that coin, it's going to be heads?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It, it just means that like you didn't
flip enough time to get an accurate sample
[SPEAKER_03]: of, of the population.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you grow, if you buy 10 seeds and
you only grow three of them and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: all males, you might conclude,
well, this, all this, all the seeds in the
[SPEAKER_03]: seed line are males, but that wouldn't be
a correct population.
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be an error that you're making in
your conclusion because you didn't grow
[SPEAKER_03]: enough plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so I would argue that most
cannabis breeders, again, working in small
[SPEAKER_03]: spaces and closets and not working in
fields and not keeping proper records that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're making these conclusions based of
observations that they've made,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the observations that they've made
have been on too small of a population to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually say it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you hear a breeder say,
yeah, well the plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: this population produces 70% males.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you grew 10 plants and seven of them
were males, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's, that's not a statistically
significant conclusion, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and plant breeding happens to be
potentially heavily stats based.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot about math and numbers,
um, and measuring traits and looking for
[SPEAKER_03]: population means and outliers and all that
kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really boring and not exciting to
talk about when you just want to get high
[SPEAKER_03]: and smoke a bunch of weed and talk about
turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, there's a science that goes on
behind all of the dance.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, there's a genetic dance.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a biological dance that goes on
under the sea, under the scenes of,
[SPEAKER_03]: of plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you really have to understand that
science, um, and apply those scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: methods to be making conclusions that
we're making.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I'm not trying to talk bad
about anybody else in the scene for not
[SPEAKER_03]: having that set of knowledge, but you got
to understand that people just need to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand that, um, you can't make
conclusions like that off of small
[SPEAKER_03]: populations because it's many,
many times with small populations you end
[SPEAKER_03]: up having this, this, um, artifact called,
um, sampling error, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A perfect, perfect description of that
sort of situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember when I was having a
discussion with James being the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the owner of seeds here now,
he mentioned to me that, uh, someone
[SPEAKER_00]: contacted him and was like, I got 10 miles
in a regular packet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this person is obviously pretty upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And James was like, congrats, but you won
the lottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, like, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can happen, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You flip a coin 10 times.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get 10 miles.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rare, but you can't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I just, when, when you have
that kind of stuff with people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you just give them more seeds,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like why people freaking out, they're just
seeds, you know, give some, hook somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody has a problem with your seeds,
why are you trying to drag it out?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, sure, there's people that take
advantage.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens, but you know what,
what does it cost you to give a customer
[SPEAKER_03]: another 10 seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was his, his resolution
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he also even made the point of saying,
you know, you should feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's probably, you know,
a bit of a, like an assumption,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, there's probably someone out
there who got a 10 female pack because of
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything has to balance out in the end,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about probabilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for every it's, you know,
these things are all graphed on what we
[SPEAKER_03]: call a normal distribution or a bell
curve.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for every one person, that's what
one end of the bell, there's also somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: that's at the other end of the bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something I've always been really
personally interested in is many moons ago
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was a wee lad, I remember reading
your article on a forum about how cubing
[SPEAKER_00]: is a myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this blew my mind because I,
up until that point, I was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: very devout to the idea of the cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the question that I always
wondered when I learned a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: about genetics was I might be
misunderstanding maybe some of the points
[SPEAKER_00]: you wrote about in that little article,
but essentially what I took away was that
[SPEAKER_00]: you could get to where you want to be in
like a BX1 more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that be a fair kind of statement to
say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so, so a first back cross
generation, you can get as far as you can
[SPEAKER_03]: in a third back cross generation,
but there's other plants in that
[SPEAKER_03]: generation are still going to be the
equivalent to the F1 hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the point that Sol was making,
and you've got to remember Sol was a,
[SPEAKER_03]: is or was, I don't know if he still is,
but he's an engineer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not a biologist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't understand how biology
works and how meiosis works specifically,
[SPEAKER_03]: meiosis is the way that cells divide to
produce germline cells or sex cells that
[SPEAKER_03]: become, you know, female eggs or male
sperm or male pollen or female ovules on a
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't understand that, it's kind of
hard to, you know, if you're making
[SPEAKER_03]: conclusions as an engineer on biological
processes, then you don't understand those
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're probably going to make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so, yeah, in the third back cross
generation, or even in the first back
[SPEAKER_03]: cross generation, yes, you're going to
find plants that are like 99% like the
[SPEAKER_03]: mother plant, say that the mother is the
recurrent parent in the back cross
[SPEAKER_03]: generation or in the back cross scheme.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: The truth is, is that you're going to find
another plant in that same generation that
[SPEAKER_03]: is, it still has 50% of the genetics from
the male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a whole in the population,
yes, the population as a whole only has
[SPEAKER_03]: 25% of the genetics from any, from the
male and 75% of the genetics from the
[SPEAKER_03]: female.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that doesn't mean that every
individual in that population is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you're using a male,
if you're selecting, again, if you,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you do this poor kind of breeding
practice and candidates where you use one
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and that you select from your your
first back cross generation, you might
[SPEAKER_03]: choose the plant that is still 50% of the
male genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you cross it back again.
[SPEAKER_03]: You actually haven't gained any genetic
progress over time, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: To move it over time, you have to do that
back cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're essentially trying to drag the
entire population towards the female,
[SPEAKER_03]: the genetics of the female.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now look, that female of hers in and of
herself might be a hybrid plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if that female was an F1 plant back
crossing, and I think I was talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: grapefruit and the sweet tooth,
you know, in context of this or the
[SPEAKER_03]: grapefruit blueberry hybrid, when you,
when you start crossing back to a hybrid,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't actually ever get towards a
hundred percent like the parent because
[SPEAKER_03]: the parent is already a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already segregating every generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, you might get to a point
where all of the genetics came from that
[SPEAKER_03]: one plant, but they're just, the
population is still segregated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still segregating for all the traits
that are in that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you don't actually get close to a
true breeding nature, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in the real plant breeding world,
you don't use back crossing in the way
[SPEAKER_03]: that we use it or that people have
traditionally used it that have professed
[SPEAKER_03]: cubing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't, you don't do it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you do is you use a line that is
already true breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the reason that you would back
cross to a line is you cross it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you take that true breeding line or true
to type line where all the plants look the
[SPEAKER_03]: same and they come up the same with the
same smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you might want to add, call it auto
flowering to that trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you cross it to an auto flowering
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You grow up the offspring and you back
cross it to the, your, what we call the
[SPEAKER_03]: recurrent parents or, you know,
in this case, call it grapefruit or
[SPEAKER_03]: princess or whatever the plant that they
were doing chasing in C99.
[SPEAKER_03]: You only want that one trait, the auto
trait from your pollen dose donor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to take the rest of that plant's
genome and throw it away, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that is something that you can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that's the way they do it in the real
plant breeding world.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, it's called trait
introgression.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wrote a little about it in,
um, in Jorge Cervantes, the marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: horticulture book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think it's the medical Bible is what
they call it, but I wrote the breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: chapter in there and I kind of explained
that breeding program on how to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so trade introgression, through back
crossing is something that you want to do
[SPEAKER_03]: with an already true breeding population,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you took like an OG Kush, which is a
little bit of a hybrid plant anyway on its
[SPEAKER_03]: own and you kept back crossing to it,
you're not going to get a true breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: plant from it because again, that plant's
a hybrid and those, those traits are going
[SPEAKER_03]: to keep segregating over time until you
are able to actually find the true
[SPEAKER_03]: homozygous parents and cross them
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So this idea that you can cross back to a
plant three times and all of a sudden all
[SPEAKER_03]: the offspring are going to look like the
mother plant is wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If the plant is a hybrid plant and it has
heterozygosity or a lot of genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity in its own genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the plants that come from that plant
might have the collection of traits from
[SPEAKER_03]: the genome, but they're not all going to
look the same and they're not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: breed true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the, the one question above maybe
what you'd already answered that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of wondering was that given that
there are so many different genes and
[SPEAKER_00]: alleles and chromosomes within plants,
is it fair to say in your mind that by
[SPEAKER_00]: doing additional back crosses,
you could potentially lock in additional
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that were maybe in the original
mother in the princess, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, cause maybe in the first back
cross, you locked down like 70% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: traits you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get what you're saying where like
you could find one with like 99,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if I'm understanding this correct,
you'd have to run more seeds to find that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas would you like agree that if you
did more back crosses, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretically lock down more of the traits
so that they're going to express more
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently or have I misunderstood that?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you can't because again, the condition
that the parent has is it already like,
[SPEAKER_03]: so your recurrent parent, let's call it,
let's just use C99 and we'll use princess
[SPEAKER_03]: as the recurrent parent.
[SPEAKER_03]: So princess herself was a hybrid plant.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you were to self, if you were to
cross princess to itself, forget the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the, the outcross to a new type to back
cross for a second, let's just self
[SPEAKER_03]: princess.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you self princess, she comes out
looking like an F2 more or less,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, she's a hybrid for almost
all the traits that are in the,
[SPEAKER_03]: in the plant in her genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got heterozygosity across her
chromosomes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, let me simplify this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe for your listeners a little bit,
like in every, let's, let's, let's
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody think in terms of their own,
their self and their family.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have half of the chrome in your
genetic compliment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heavenly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got half of your chromosomes from
your mom and half from your dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got 22 from mom or you got 22 and
an X from mom and you got 22 and a Y from
[SPEAKER_03]: dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in your mind, let's make mom's blue and
dad's red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you cross those two types
together, like if you were able to somehow
[SPEAKER_03]: breed with only yourself, there's going to
be three possibilities for every
[SPEAKER_03]: chromosome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can either have two red ones,
you can have two blue ones, or you can
[SPEAKER_03]: have one red and one blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now let's add in the, the, the parent that
we're going to introgress and we'll do a
[SPEAKER_03]: back cross path.
[SPEAKER_03]: Population.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we're putting in pollen from,
let's assume in the best case scenario,
[SPEAKER_03]: a completely hundred percent true breeding
plant and let's label all the chromosomes
[SPEAKER_03]: in our mind as black.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you cross the black to the,
to the possibilities of either red and
[SPEAKER_03]: blue or red and blue, you got two
possibilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have black and blue or black and
red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when you back cross the,
either of those types to the red and blue,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, now we've just got a mess of three
different types all segregating together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to make it uniform and true breeding,
you have to have two of one type.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you want to have blue and blue or red
and red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's maybe that's a terrible way of
explaining it, but the point is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that we all have chromosomes from our
mom and our dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so somehow we were able to back cross
to ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a 50 50 shot, whether you get
the, the chromosome from mom or the
[SPEAKER_03]: chromosome from dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't matter how many times you
back cross to yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the, if you've got one of each type of
chromosome, you're never going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way that you can get there is if
the plant that you're back crossing to is
[SPEAKER_03]: either red, red or blue, blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if it, if it is over time,
you'll eventually get to all blue or all
[SPEAKER_03]: red.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as long as that initial plant that
you're using as your recurrent parent has
[SPEAKER_03]: what we call heterozygosity or as a hybrid
plant, it has different chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, every, every plant has your
cannabis plant has 10 chromosomes,
[SPEAKER_03]: nine what we call autosomes and one pair
of sex chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If those plants have different
chromosomes, it doesn't matter how many
[SPEAKER_03]: times you back cross it, you're never
going to get any closer to your goal.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so cubing with the idea that,
yeah, after three generations,
[SPEAKER_03]: the offspring look exactly like mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: After three generations, the vast majority
of the population has genetics only from
[SPEAKER_03]: mom, but that doesn't mean that those
plants are going to breed true in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for clearing that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That does make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I suggest the listeners,
if you, if you got lost at any point,
[SPEAKER_00]: feel free to go back and listen to it a
few more times, but hopefully you will be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to mention, we're obviously
so lucky to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to chat about some of your
personal breedings that you'd done before
[SPEAKER_00]: we jump into maybe some of the sort of
intellectual property and patent work
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been involved in, which is very,
very interesting to a lot of our
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I first just wanted to give you a
quick kudos.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy, Green and Gold Farms,
when I was at his house on the weekend,
[SPEAKER_00]: I told him I was going to be interviewing
you and he pulled out a jar of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: your sour diesel cross to sweet skunk that
he grew probably about five years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he said, but he's really good at
curing and storing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's been the inspiration for a
lot of these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was writing them, I was puffing
away on that one from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell you what, it's a phenomenal
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like piffy in a way,
like very up, like more uplifting than you
[SPEAKER_00]: would have expected either of the parents
to kind of be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's probably kudos to him as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all we can do is put the genes
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the grower that brings it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other plants like sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, there's one over here
called it's a Seedsman.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a plant that came out of the Seedsman
Hayes, which Seedsman were just seeds that
[SPEAKER_03]: they were buying in bulk from David.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you grow the and so they I don't
know whether it was they were this this
[SPEAKER_03]: seed came from ones that they had bought
directly from David or they had bought
[SPEAKER_03]: from David and repopulated them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then this seed came from those.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll tell you, this plant came to me
as a clone and I had them in the grow room
[SPEAKER_03]: and they would continually get mixed up
one for the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from veg, clone, flower, bud,
you had to have a really trained eye to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to tell the two of them apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with the grapefruit and the soul
shine.
[SPEAKER_03]: They both have like their their set of
traits are so similar that you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: know the plant intimately and be like,
oh, this one has a slightly wider leaf and
[SPEAKER_03]: a different curl to the, you know,
the the serration and the leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: That one is this one and this one is the
other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, you can't tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my friends used to grow the
grapefruit and the soul shine in
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouses and they would mix the bud and
nobody ever knew that the bud was mixed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so there's so that's when I when I talk
about a flavor class, that's an example of
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where, you know, we're not going to push
this in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll use the kind of more crass
analogy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, it's kind of like
saying, well, all all Asian kids look the
[SPEAKER_03]: same.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a variation in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might find two kids that almost look
identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just you're not familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't see the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But within any family, there's groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the you know, and that's one of the
things we we learned again when we did
[SPEAKER_03]: these large populations grows with all the
chemical analysis that you can identify
[SPEAKER_03]: these unique types and that it's not every
plant is not while it might be a unique
[SPEAKER_03]: individual, it's not necessarily a unique
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the buzz you couldn't tell apart from
between them.
So.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they got sweet, sweet skunk in the
in the Seedman's Haze or pure or the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, again, we can talk about
that later with Napro.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, we learned that these terpene
profiles, their characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a trait that gets inherited.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so while the plant might not be
identical to the parent, oftentimes the
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene profile is right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can end up with plants that smell
exactly like the mom or the dad.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when when Steve found this sweet
skunk plant or his friend that found it,
[SPEAKER_03]: found it, whatever the story is and who
cares.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he found a plant that was neat,
but he just found a plant that was a
[SPEAKER_03]: subtype of this terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really a unique plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sweet skunk kind of fits the description
of what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it really is a kind of piffy
equatorial plant that has that really what
[SPEAKER_03]: we would, you know, classically use.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to use the word I hate using
sativa, but it's it's it's got that
[SPEAKER_03]: profile and it's got, like you said,
the fox tails and the the the kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: staggered calyxes or the staggered bracts
on the flower structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a big, beefy plant, which is kind
of odd because the mother was right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like sour diesel is not huge, but it does
have quite dense, modern looking flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Highly resinous, very, very fuely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in in a lot of individuals from that
family, they kind of got stomped on by the
[SPEAKER_03]: the sweet skunk side, which really was not
expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it might have added a
little more intensity to the high.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like that hybrid.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some really great plants in that
in that family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I look, I'm certainly keen to try
some others based on this experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a viewer ask a question of,
are you releasing seeds that they would be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to purchase?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, like where can someone pick up
some of your work?
[SPEAKER_03]: So Breeders Retail is really the main bank
that's over in the UK because I'm working
[SPEAKER_03]: in Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mainly the work that I'm doing in the
regulated market can only be sold through
[SPEAKER_03]: the regulated market in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things about the legal aspects
in Canada is that we've created this legal
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in order to respect international drug
law, of which we're still beholden to the
[SPEAKER_03]: EU, we don't export recreational products.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can only export medical or scientific
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of the work that I'm actually
doing right now won't actually be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: leave the Canadian system until we can
start exporting it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the old work is still available.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually pulled everything off the
market a couple of years ago when there
[SPEAKER_03]: was this big PubCo frenzy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just reopening Breeders Retail,
which is a site that will be up soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an old friend in the UK that's gonna
do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the stock is produced over there
in Europe many years ago anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it can be sold internationally from
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There probably will be a way at some point
in time for some other work to be done in
[SPEAKER_03]: Europe legally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then those seeds can be sold onto the
international market through that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not a current thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now we're kind of trying to get this
new iteration of the business within the
[SPEAKER_03]: Canadian market to be able to supply
clones and improve genetics to all the new
[SPEAKER_03]: licensed growers that are coming online.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got many now in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it started with just a few,
but we have well over a couple of hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: licensed growers and some new small craft
growers that they're calling micro
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses that are allowed to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's 250 square meters,
which is good because it's enough for a
[SPEAKER_03]: family to a family run business for people
to make enough money to make a living and
[SPEAKER_03]: probably make a good living.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it also allows them to focus on a
smaller footprint.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a higher quality product than
what was coming out of these very large
[SPEAKER_03]: grows that are producing hundreds of
thousands of square feet worth of flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you start producing cannabis on
that scale, it's actually quite difficult
[SPEAKER_03]: to maintain the level of quality that
people have come to expect from the high
[SPEAKER_03]: quality cannabis that you can find on any
given market around the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: really.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, so our new our new project
is really bringing in the genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got the ability to legally import
genetics from other countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've been bringing in a lot of work
that was done in Europe under license over
[SPEAKER_03]: there, bringing it into Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to be rescreening large
populations of all the old goodies and
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing them to life and making them
available in the new system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to specifically ask I want to
talk about some of your older strains in
[SPEAKER_00]: just a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we do, I've noticed that some
of the more newer ones and by new,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, relative term, you you're
working with sweet skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously you had involvement with
sweet skunk in the past and Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be the simple answer to the
question that it was just like proximity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But were there any specific
characteristics about the sweet skunk that
[SPEAKER_00]: you really liked, which kind of made you
want to work with it a little more?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one of the reasons is it reverses
easily.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, when you're doing a seed
crop that's going to be sold, you want it
[SPEAKER_03]: to produce as many seeds as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was one of the drivers behind it
as an initial feminized release.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also a great plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a it's a really hazy, piffy type,
as you were saying earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It leaves this beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say in like sweet, perfumey
incency.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nose in the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's kind of bizarre.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those things that I've had
with other other types as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, if you're lighting the joint,
you don't smell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you, you know, if you like the
joint, you smoke a little bit and then you
[SPEAKER_03]: pass it to somebody and you leave the room
for a few minutes and then come back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're immediately hit by this very sweet,
incency, kind of unique, exotic smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hard to it's hard to describe
again because we don't have a common set
[SPEAKER_03]: of knowledge or a common set of words to
describe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really quite intriguing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so so from that perspective,
yeah, I just wanted to see how she came
[SPEAKER_03]: together and interplayed with some of the
other plants that I had in the collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a part of a breeding program.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are not finished breeding programs
by any means.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I kind of like to release,
release small batches out of those so that
[SPEAKER_03]: other people have the same genetics that
I'm working with and they can create
[SPEAKER_03]: parallel lines or backcross them to for
example.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that would be a great candidate,
for example, to backcross to sour diesel
[SPEAKER_03]: or to sweet skunk, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can kind of start different breeding
programs with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was really one of the reasons
that I did that with the blueberry lines
[SPEAKER_03]: as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, blueberry is a great population.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really interesting plant with the
colors and some of the shapes and things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also has some weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you're using a population like
that, sometimes you want to we were
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about backcrossing earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes you might want to take one of
those traits from the hybrid plant and use
[SPEAKER_03]: that to intergress or incorporate into the
blueberry line, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of these things are part of
projects that are ongoing that I kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: just share along the way so that they
don't get lost if, you know, something
[SPEAKER_03]: happens to me, they end up in other
people's hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's part of responsible plant
breeding is to share things with people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, which is kind of funny given the
conversation that we're going to have in
[SPEAKER_03]: the future about intellectual property and
cannabis development.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, those are fantastic plants and I
really like those populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the proof's in the pudding,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just touched on my next question
perfectly for me where I was going to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about how you had some notable experience
working with some of the earlier versions
[SPEAKER_00]: of blueberry and notably in your fighting
Buddha cross, you use like an F2
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the part which struck my
curiosity the most was that this was back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the generations where people often
regarded blueberry as like more blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you often hear comments about the
blueberry muffin or the blueberry syrup
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes that the earlier generations had,
which are often said to not quite be
[SPEAKER_00]: present anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that your experience that there was
those sort of expressions?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your thoughts on blueberry now?
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so one little correction.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the blueberry that we actually
used was an F4.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were seeds from DJ.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe it hasn't publicly been known,
but I don't think it's terrible to say
[SPEAKER_03]: that those seeds, they came to Canada from
someone arrived them here, whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: with DJ or without him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I saw them, they all came and
they were in a container or they were in a
[SPEAKER_03]: one piece of corrugated plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's all these different lines in
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: My understanding was that those were seeds
that had come back from Dutch Passion
[SPEAKER_03]: after DJ's experience with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these seeds were returned to him and
they were the pure seeds that he had
[SPEAKER_03]: originally brought over from which Dutch
Passion started their programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they came back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they came back, I think that
they'd been a little bit mixed up to a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain degree.
[SPEAKER_03]: But from from DJ's notes and information
that we had, and he was there at the time
[SPEAKER_03]: as well, I believe they were actually an
F4.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant that we selected was from the F4
generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that work that was done in Canada
was done at a Friends Grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't a huge grow, but it was,
you know, I think 12 or 15 lights or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that enough to grow a bunch
of really small plants and screen them
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we think grew like or the grower grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of went over and helped with the
selections and babysat them a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it wasn't my grow, to be clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the grower there, you know,
grew all these plants and then our friend
[SPEAKER_03]: read from legends and DJ would come up and
we would go through the plants and look
[SPEAKER_03]: for different candidates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was part of the the group that
did that got to do all the selections on
[SPEAKER_03]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we looked at, you know, like a few
hundred of each type, the flow,
[SPEAKER_03]: what was supposed to be the blue
moonshine, the blueberry, and they all got
[SPEAKER_03]: relayed, renamed, you know, F the F number
13 or flow number 13 became F13.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a plant called.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was B25.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was in the blueberry line and
that plant became the mother of great
[SPEAKER_03]: crush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it actually was a plant like you're
talking about, like she was in the
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry muffin side of the cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's also a lot of stuff on the
other side, which is more of like I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: mean spicy and like a hot exotic way,
just like kind of a dry kind of a roasty
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor and with a lot of chocolate
influence to it, like a lot of chocolatey
[SPEAKER_03]: notes to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is really, really prevalent in
both the flow and the blueberry lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think at this point in time,
well, this was an F4.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was earlier than the most
generations that have been on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even they were a bit blue or a bit
more chocolatey than the blueberry flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had previously grown quite small
populations because, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: getting DJ seeds in Canada was pretty
expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't afford to grow 500 of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we grew, you know,
150 of them or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I found a couple of plants that were
quite.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that blueberry syrup, sweet character,
sweet side of the cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ's plants are they've been like I said,
they've been bred for multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: generations, usually using one plant as
the parent of each generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they in my opinion, they suffer a
little bit from inbreeding depression,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is corrected when you hybridize them
to another plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's something that's present in the
line if you're trying to grow up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's also this characteristic that
I call the crinkle or the leaf that some
[SPEAKER_03]: people call it the twisted leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a it's a or variegation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really a form of variegation,
but it's a genetic anomaly that the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: has where the leaf kind of grows like
really weird shaped.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't look like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it looks like cannabis,
but they're all kind of gnarled and
[SPEAKER_03]: twisted rather than having these long,
beautiful, straight lamina like the,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the fingers of the of the
typical cannibal cannabis leaf that
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from a breeding perspective,
you can grow a lot of those and throw them
[SPEAKER_03]: away.
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ like to think that he had an idea that
maybe those plants were the more desirable
[SPEAKER_03]: ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that he selected for that
trait a little bit in past generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why, again, we see it
reoccurring in future generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, again, like begets like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you select those plants in past
generations, there's a higher probability
[SPEAKER_03]: that those plants are going to be seen in
the in the future generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I try actually personally,
I tried to stick away from those plants
[SPEAKER_03]: because I saw them as a negative
characteristic in the population.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, from a growers point of view,
I actually worked in a seed shop,
[SPEAKER_03]: a head shop when I was in university.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember a guy coming in,
he had spent 250 bucks on 10 of the DJ
[SPEAKER_03]: blueberry and he came back in with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, this was back in the day
when it was like, if you brought a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: into a public store, you were pretty much
crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this dude walks in the store with
these plants and they're all twisted.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got this really ugly variegated
leaf and they just didn't grow very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were growing very fast and they
were suffering from inbreeding depression.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was demanding his money back
because, you know, he had paid so much
[SPEAKER_03]: money that he shouldn't be gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, dude, that's what the seeds
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, we're not making the
seeds here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of get what you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we gave him another pack and
sent him on his way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you do, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: As you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but but so I really like DJ's
population.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's for the most part, you know,
when he was doing all that work in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's that he never crossed it like the one
thing that he did that was so cool is that
[SPEAKER_03]: he never just crossed it to to everything
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's kind of this weird thing
in the in the cannabis community where,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the way that people breed weed
is they breed cannabis was the last at
[SPEAKER_03]: least 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you take you grow out last
year's Cannabis Cup winner and you find a
[SPEAKER_03]: new plant and then somebody would win the
Cannabis Cup the next year and you'd get
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds from that and you'd cross that to
your old plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the next year, somebody has
another plant that wins the Cannabis Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you just go and cross it again to
the next plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nobody really took the time to start
stabilizing or trying to to to stabilize
[SPEAKER_03]: and make anything uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was always about just crossing it to
the next best thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And DJ didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he made his initial crosses and then
he didn't go outside for germplasm.
[SPEAKER_03]: He only worked within the families that he
had that he had created.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to me, Flo and Blueberry and,
you know, after teen and Grapecrush and
[SPEAKER_03]: all these ones to me, I look at those as
like they're really all one family,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're like cousins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they're or they're what we call half
siblings or half brothers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They share a mother or they share a
father.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to me, it's really all one family
rather than a bunch of different types.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, there are different phenotypes
and genotypes within the family.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, the blue moonshine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, stocky.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's got its shorter stature.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got wide leaves and frosty buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the great the Blueberry story is
a little bit taller.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the F-13 has its own thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've all got kind of their own
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all like a little bit different
flower structure, scent, all that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they all they all also do have all
these characteristics that are quite
[SPEAKER_03]: shared amongst the DJ family, like the
really purple leaf stems and the really
[SPEAKER_03]: purple striped leaves or sorry,
stems, the main stocks of the underside of
[SPEAKER_03]: the leaves of that kind of purple color.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, so that the fact that he had all
that stuff and bred it in line and kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: kept it isolated from the rest of the drug
pool, it really makes it interesting for
[SPEAKER_03]: actually using as a hybridization tool to
cross back to other parts of the drug
[SPEAKER_03]: pool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I think that we've seen
such an incredible spread of those those
[SPEAKER_03]: genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we see it on all sorts of lines from
like Bubbleberry to Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's like over, you know,
15, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not many breeders that have had
that kind of influence.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, we got to, you know,
you got to love DJ.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also just a great guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a really, really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wholeheartedly agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always been very, very lovely to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Big Ups DJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess there's a follow on question
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite DJ short cross or
cultivar that you've come across?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess there's a little follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you currently follow his more recent
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he's actually digging into some of
his really old stock, trying to pull some
[SPEAKER_00]: cool, unique stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought maybe that might be interesting
to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we kind of lost touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he was when we were working
together and doing all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: he was living in Canada and he was
actually trying to move here during the or
[SPEAKER_03]: he went through a period of trying to move
here during the Bush years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it didn't work out in the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he eventually moved back down to to to
wherever he is in Oregon and California.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when he was in Vancouver, I had just
moved to Vancouver, you know, very like
[SPEAKER_03]: right before then.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he coincidentally lived like three
blocks from my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we used to go over to DJ's house.
[SPEAKER_03]: He and the lady he was with at the time,
Carla, she was just a super lovely lady as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'd have these epic parties there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They took over an apartment in in that
area of town that another friend of ours
[SPEAKER_03]: used to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like the place must have been
like a 1970s cocaine palace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was all this big, big shag carpet
and mirrors all over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the place and they were on the top
floor and there was an elevator that you
[SPEAKER_03]: would you'd get in and it would go up to
the top floor and nobody else could get
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd have to buzz you up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the elevator would open and there'd be
this big mirror bar like right in front of
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was kind of like a great entrance
place to have these parties.
[SPEAKER_03]: A really nice balcony overlooking downtown
Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_03]: So during that process, that was when I
really got to explore DJ stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: because, like I said, we were growing all
these seed lines for a selection of what
[SPEAKER_03]: became True Blueberry, F13, Grape Crush
and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I got to see the plants that he
liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to see the flowers that he liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I spent probably, he was actually at
the time we were doing the grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: he was actually still down in the States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I spent a fair amount of time in the
garden kind of just looking over it and
[SPEAKER_03]: learning about his lines and watering
plants and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was really, I really got to see a
large, because I've honestly, I've never
[SPEAKER_03]: grown large populations of DJ stuff aside
from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, we did some smaller grows,
but nothing on any kind of scale delving
[SPEAKER_03]: into the entire genetic diversity,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the things that I didn't like about
those plants were again, the curl.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that that was a really trait
that it was not, it wasn't a great thing
[SPEAKER_03]: for growers, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of a pain in the butt to deal
with if you were a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants with the curl, they were very
sensitive to nutrients and you couldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: push them very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't yield a ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: They kind of grew a little bit slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we were doing the hybrids,
I kind of shied away from those plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really went more towards plants that
were better growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from that perspective, from the better
grower plants, my favorite plant from that
[SPEAKER_03]: whole family was B133, which became the
old time moonshine.
[SPEAKER_03]: An old time moonshine is a great plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't have the curl.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grew really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had all the rest of the stuff that
you'd expect from a DJ line, like the
[SPEAKER_03]: purple underside of the leaves and the
purple stems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had a really nice flowers,
like a good commercial dense flower
[SPEAKER_03]: structure and scent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had that blueberry kind of flavor
scent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, we went to make the seeds
from those crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all shared the same parental plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really we selected the winners,
cloned them up, and then they went in a
[SPEAKER_03]: room kind of in a multi-grid section with
many copies of the same male plant that DJ
[SPEAKER_03]: had selected.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all the plants set an incredible
amount of seed except for the old time
[SPEAKER_03]: moonshine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the grower was really choked because
they thought they were getting paid based
[SPEAKER_03]: on the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one section of the room that was
like 15% of the room or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: it barely set seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the one plant, one plant would make
maybe, I don't know, 50 seeds at the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas a plant that size would normally
produce well over 1,000 seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was almost insomnia.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was something about, there's
something called self-incompatibility in
[SPEAKER_03]: plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that just means when you breed plants
that are out crossers too closely
[SPEAKER_03]: together, they don't make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for whatever reason, whether it was
self-incompatibility or it was just
[SPEAKER_03]: something to do with this plant,
this plant was almost sterile,
[SPEAKER_03]: not quite, but almost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in a bud, you might have one seed
rather than 30.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of buds that had no seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so from a seed making point of view,
it kind of sucked because you had this
[SPEAKER_03]: great plant that it wanted to make seeds
from, but for whatever reason genetically,
[SPEAKER_03]: it just, it didn't make seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those things became really rare on the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was why the old time moonshine
kind of disappeared more quickly than any
[SPEAKER_03]: of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just didn't make enough seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've got a bunch of those in the
library.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also took that plant and I reversed it
and had it produce male plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pollen and it produced copious
quantities of pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was one of the ones that I
used when I did my work with DJ.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used the same males that he was using
and I took a few of my favorite of his
[SPEAKER_03]: female plants and I reversed those as well
and threw them in the pollen mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably, I don't know, I want to say up
to 30%, but that's probably being
[SPEAKER_03]: generous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was probably closer to like 10 to 15%
of the plants came from the female pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: and the rest of it came from the males.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's born out.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the, the sex ratios and the
offspring that they are pretty close to
[SPEAKER_03]: regular seeds, you grow a hundred,
you're going to have only slightly more
[SPEAKER_03]: females than males.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really liked that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked the F13 for the nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a bit of a quirky grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, she's got that curl.
[SPEAKER_03]: The grape crush was really interesting
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had this kind of neat trait where it
had kind of a rounded top cola and all the
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf, the subtending leaflets,
the little leaves that stick out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rather than being triangles, they were
rounded at the tips and they had a nice
[SPEAKER_03]: little purple stripe that kind of ripped,
that kind of went around the edge of that
[SPEAKER_03]: subtending leaflet as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, they were pretty plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they were pretty, they were pretty
nice looking plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of my favorites were the cross,
the mental frost, floss cross with that
[SPEAKER_03]: B133 plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just, they really came out quite
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, yeah, those are, those are my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't love the B, the true blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was neat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the most part, it was a little bit
too leaning towards the chocolatey side
[SPEAKER_03]: for me, not the blueberry, you know,
and, and having said that, I've met a
[SPEAKER_03]: grower in the last year and a half here in
Canada and he bought those seeds from,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the group that made them back in
2005, I guess it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I met him a year and a half ago,
maybe two years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he showed me his blueberry and it's
everything that you'd want in a blueberry
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's completely blueberry
muffin smelling.
[SPEAKER_03]: It, it grows really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it came from that kind of inbred mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it, it might just be that
those blueberry muffin phenotypes that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're talking about are still in the
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, they're a little more rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have, you'll have to grow a bunch of
them to make a bunch of them find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy actually only grew a 10 pack and
he found this really nice plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you can hit it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, but again, like with any plant
breeding thing, it's, it's numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're growing three seeds,
you're going to have a hard time finding
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're growing 10, 20, you'll probably
have a better shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got that one in a million.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask you about how you had done
a grapefruit cross to blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a cross which has been done in
many forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost a bit of a redux of sweet
tooth, but also, you know, BCGA did their
[SPEAKER_00]: own version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my question is, do you feel like
there were components of maybe sweet tooth
[SPEAKER_00]: or the BCGA cross that you thought could
be improved?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I ask is because in a
lot of your work, there's like progeny of
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet tooth being like sweet skunk and
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously you like the line,
I guess, but did you feel like there were
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of it that could be improved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you do that cross for other
reasons?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I did the cross for other reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be perfectly frank, those were done
really out of a goodwill gesture to Steve
[SPEAKER_03]: and Spice Life when he left Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was in a pretty rough shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had been busted by the cops and things
weren't really going his way.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had moved back to Canada and was trying
to get into the wine business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had contracted this room to be
produced for those crosses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, you know what, they had made a
very small batch of the sweet tooth 1.1,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the same cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: I label it great for blueberry because I
don't want the drama.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's, you know, they were produced for
Steve, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They were supposed to be sold on the Spice
Life seed catalog.
[SPEAKER_03]: And through life circumstances that they
stopped being sold to Steve.
[SPEAKER_03]: He kind of just, I don't know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: He stopped selling seeds for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just put it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I put them under my catalog and
just called them what they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the deal behind the Grapefruit
Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were never intended for my catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you ever get a chance to try the
BCGA version?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, did you have any thoughts on
that one?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's more or less the same,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Vic High gave me the Grapefruit
clone, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy from the BCGA, you know,
rest his soul, gave me the parent.
[SPEAKER_03]: He brought it to me one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met him in Montreal for a meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had gone down to meet his seed supplier
down there and I was not far down the
[SPEAKER_03]: road, a couple of hour drive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to go meet him because he was
a pretty smart guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he was a, you know,
he was contentious, like, like we all can
[SPEAKER_03]: be at times.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, when I showed up, he was like,
I brought you a gift and he tossed me a
[SPEAKER_03]: Tupperware container and it had that clone
and it had the AE-77 California Orange
[SPEAKER_03]: clone, which I don't know if you know that
one, but that was a big thing back on
[SPEAKER_03]: those old boards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wanted it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The funny thing that nobody realized about
it was when Vic gave it to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: he said, okay, here's, here's the
Grapefruit, you know, cause you want that
[SPEAKER_03]: for flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the California Orange.
[SPEAKER_03]: This plant is a five on 10 on every trait,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, it's a five on potency.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a five on flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a unique flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It had that orangey turpiness and that's
where really a lot of the orange stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're descendants from that one,
but you know, Subcool used it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A whole bunch of people used it for
different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vic used it for the Orange Crush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but the re the real reason that he
gave it to me, he said, this one's a five
[SPEAKER_03]: on 10 on everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we have a scale that we can use to
compare things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can compare notes from across the
country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I was living on the East,
the, the more Eastern end of Canada and he
[SPEAKER_03]: was on the West coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was his way of kind of calibrating
the scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was, he was, he was saying this
five on 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you got something that's a five on
town on everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when we talk about stuff,
you know, if this is a five, then you can
[SPEAKER_03]: now assign whatever values to any other
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was kind of a nice thing to him
to do because it was, it was, it was just
[SPEAKER_03]: a very genuine gift.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, at that point in time,
Steve was over in Switzerland and when he
[SPEAKER_03]: came back, I returned the great fruit to
him, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Along with the sweet skunk as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's actually quite full circle
there, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: What goes, what goes around comes around,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of one of those things with
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's really poor form.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, if you find a plant or select a plant
or a plant comes to you and then you lose
[SPEAKER_03]: it, but you've given it to somebody else,
it's kind of lame if they won't give it
[SPEAKER_03]: back to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, it's completely lame.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but people do that kind of stuff
with cannabis because they think that they
[SPEAKER_03]: have something that's unique and it gives
them a commercial advantage.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the truth is when it comes to plants,
especially in a prohibition market,
[SPEAKER_03]: the only way to keep it is to give it
away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you get a bad bug or,
you know, a bad police visitor or someone,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you can lose things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And stuff happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants just die in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like things go wrong.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the watering systems fail or your
backup plan or a plant gets like Pythium
[SPEAKER_03]: or something like stuff dies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really the only way for it to really
survive is if you pass it around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and if you pass it around and it
survives in everybody's garden,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's probably a good plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you pass it around and nobody keeps it,
that's probably not a good plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a good way to get like
external validation on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look, this is a perfect segue because
I had a question I wanted to ask and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering how I was going to slot it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in relation to you mentioned the,
uh, the Cali Orange, the A77, that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting one because I remember one
time I was at Bodie's house and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: telling me, you know, it's such an old
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was dotted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was the first time I heard that
term dotted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then more recently we've had the news
come out that like the virus responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: for that has been categorized as the
hoplite and hemp virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've probably heard about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, A, what are your thoughts
on that virus?
[SPEAKER_00]: And B, do you think we might ever see a
virus emerge, which actually has a
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial effect kind of in the way that
Pinot Noir came out of Pinot Gris sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think that that's too hard to
predict?
[SPEAKER_03]: So Pinot Gris and Blanc came from Pinot
Noir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pinot Noir was the original archetype.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other ones were, the other ones
were somatic mutations of those.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that that was a virus induced
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, plants, when, when cells
divide, you gotta remember it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like your, your, the, the terrible
analogy is like if you're photocopying
[SPEAKER_03]: DNA, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the DNA copies itself and it's got a
whole, um, set of genes that are simply
[SPEAKER_03]: required, that are simply their whole
purpose is to, to make sure that when the
[SPEAKER_03]: DNA is copied, it's copied robustly and
reliably and accurately.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the truth is, is that like every set
of biological machines, they make mistakes
[SPEAKER_03]: and mutations do happen over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so there's something called a sport
and a sport is a, excuse me, it's a shoot
[SPEAKER_03]: on a plant, like a new branch that comes
out, but it's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you might have, we can use the,
the Pinot Gris or Pinot Blanc analogy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The original grape was purple or Pinot
Noir.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dark skinned grape and the farther
south you grow, it really produces a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of, um, a lot of pigments, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially like down in California,
they call Pinot Noirs from down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They call them fruit bombs because
they're, they're so dark and intensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You hold them up to the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can barely see through the,
the, the wine glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas if you take that same clone Pinot
Noir and you grow it, say in Canada or in
[SPEAKER_03]: France, which is at a higher latitude that
they're, they're what we call a claret or
[SPEAKER_03]: you can actually see through the,
the, it's not as opaque, put it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more translucent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so Pinot, one, somebody noticed,
Hey, there's a branch on this Pinot Noir
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, but the grapes are more gray
colored.
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone else in another part of the
world found one that they were white
[SPEAKER_03]: colored.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happened was the gene that was
responsible for the pigment color
[SPEAKER_03]: accumulated a mutation and that mutation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they did is they caught off the
branch, um, and they rooted it and they
[SPEAKER_03]: created it into a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they took a whole bunch of
cuttings as a mother plant and they
[SPEAKER_03]: started planting out sections of this new
grape.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can actually get, um, so that
branch would have been called it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: sport.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a sport of the Pinot, um,
Noir plant, but you can take a cutting of
[SPEAKER_03]: a sport.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's different phenotypically from
the plant that it came from, as you can
[SPEAKER_03]: tell in this case, we're talking about the
skin pigment, you can actually take that
[SPEAKER_03]: plant and go to the plant breeders rights
people and say, Hey, I found a new
[SPEAKER_03]: variation of Pinot Pinot Noir and I want
to get, you know, this arose under
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation in my vineyard.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to claim intellectual property
rights for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and you can actually get the
commercial rights for a new variety by
[SPEAKER_03]: cloning a sport from an old plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, because it's changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the same plant anymore,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: When we describe Pinot Noir part of the
thing of having a cultivar variety
[SPEAKER_03]: registered is you have to do a full
description of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you get protection on that plant,
it means that you get the protection on
[SPEAKER_03]: that whole set of characteristics taken
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one of the major characteristics,
like the fruit color changes, it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: different plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can actually register it as a new
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Pinot Gris and Pinot Noir or sorry,
Pinot Gris and Pinot Blanc are both
[SPEAKER_03]: versions of, uh, um, you know,
they're, they're, they're mute mutant
[SPEAKER_03]: versions of the Pinot Noir grape variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts on the hoplite
and virus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the COVID of the plant world,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's decimating whole greenhouse
productions in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting passed around in cuttings.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know people down there that
are, that are good friends of mine that
[SPEAKER_03]: have totally changed their, their
production systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are getting way into tissue culture
now again for growing that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you gotta remember like,
let's think, let's think of it again,
[SPEAKER_03]: the terms of the wine grapes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Pinot Gris is like, or Pinot Noir,
I'm sorry, is hundreds of years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: That clone is hundreds of years old,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, cannabis is an annual, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It grows and makes seed every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't leave it in the ground and it'll
grow back in the spring.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you got to get new plants and plug
them into the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so the natural lifestyle, cycle of
that plant is a year, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we start having plants that have
been around for many, many, many more
[SPEAKER_03]: years, the longer a plant is alive in a
production system, the more likely it is
[SPEAKER_03]: to be, uh, to interact with other forms of
biota.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, like for example,
aphids, for example, or, or thrips,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, a lot of these bugs, I don't know
if you know about Lyme disease,
[SPEAKER_03]: but Lyme disease essentially is a,
a bacteria that's carried in the mouth of
[SPEAKER_03]: a tick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you get bitten by the tick,
the slot, the bacteria lives in the slime
[SPEAKER_03]: of that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the bacteria can actually infect
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what causes the disease,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the virus is much like that with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it might be, you know, transmitted
in the mouths of, uh, thrips or,
[SPEAKER_03]: or aphids that are biting the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they bite the plant, then they,
that virus transfers over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so, you know, these crops,
that are typically grown by clone,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of the times the propagation ends up
making it into tissue culture or,
[SPEAKER_03]: or propagation in vitro, where they grow
little plants on Petri dishes rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: on mother plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's challenges to that whole
technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a whole show that we could do on
its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, you know, maybe for the people
that want to grow these, these plants from
[SPEAKER_03]: clone, um, that that may become the
standard in, in production systems where,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you're not mothering plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not taking cuttings from other
plants, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, it's like when you,
when you cut a branch off a plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're wounding the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's a, it's an open spot where it
can get infected by bacteria and viruses,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you're, you're taking that,
and then you take that same razor blade
[SPEAKER_03]: and you run around your entire greenhouse
cutting shoot after shoot, after shoot,
[SPEAKER_03]: after shoot, you're spreading the virus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody understands this in a COVID
world, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Viruses spread.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they do, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to live in another organism to,
to be able to, to, to replicate
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's all that they want to do,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is replicate themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how they, that's how they,
they, you know, that's how they,
[SPEAKER_03]: they live, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how they, how the species lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, like horticultural practices
man are super important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keeping bugs away, super important.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to be having bugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get bugs and they're potentially
bringing in viruses on their, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in their saliva or on their feet or
whatever, however they, however they,
[SPEAKER_03]: they transport it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, hot virus, man, terrible
stuff there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They found some tissue culture ways to,
uh, to remove it through tissue culture
[SPEAKER_03]: processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think they're probably using like a
heat treatment and Maristan culture,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that takes time and they charge a big
bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they, they're asking like 20 to
50,000 dollars a plant to, if you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: give them your own cutting, they'll clean
it up for you and return it to you clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, then there's the possibility
that they keep your cutting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so you might, you know, you might not
want to be handing out your genetics to a
[SPEAKER_03]: competitor or a legal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, um, and the longterm solution is
plants that are bred to be stable seed
[SPEAKER_03]: lines so that you can grow, you know,
when you eat, when we grow corn,
[SPEAKER_03]: we plant thousands of acres of corn and
the plants all come up looking identical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they've been bred by plant
breeders that know what they're doing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis we use again, using tools
like genomics, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why when you plant corn,
they all come up like clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get there with cannabis,
but it's going to take a lot of breeding
[SPEAKER_03]: work done by people that really understand
plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't just cross your, your OG to next
year's cup winner.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not going to get you to a stable
seed line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, brilliant segue into the next
question I wanted to ask, which relates to
[SPEAKER_00]: how you were mentioning that, you know,
some cultivars have been around for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 20 plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the longer something's been
around, the more chance there is for it to
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate these, you know, what I like to
refer to as plant STDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the question I wanted to ask you
was there's a lot of discussion around,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, the chem dog, it's very focal
topic of our show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the people who are familiar
with it comment that it has lost vigor
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to when it was first around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the debate exists around, is that a
sort of genetic drift?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that just a molecular biology whereby
there's some sort of vigor, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily a change in the genome?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on these sort of more
grandfathered plants, which are older,
[SPEAKER_00]: are not as vigorous as they used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you suspect might be going on
under the hood?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it could be all of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, except for genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not what genetic drift means.
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetic drift means the change in pop in,
in the frequency of alleles in a
[SPEAKER_03]: population over generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's specifically the meaning of
genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis community uses that word
totally wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, everybody kind of uses that word
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny that people have learned that
that's what that word means.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's likely not genetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I've got some friends that have
quite serious tissue culture companies
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, PhDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in plant, in plant, uh, whatever,
I don't even know what it is, like plant
[SPEAKER_03]: pathology, I guess, but they work,
they, they do tissue culture and they have
[SPEAKER_03]: companies that multiply large amounts of
cannabis clones for, um, for propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's becoming a more, a more relied upon
part of the industry and the legal
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis world in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it probably will be in the States as
well over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it will be in any market over time to
be truthfully.
[SPEAKER_03]: A truthful about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But one of the things that they learned
during this tissue culture, tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: culture, and they were also trying to find
a way to validate the genetic identity of
[SPEAKER_03]: a given plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just like how you can identify a
criminal by the DNA that they've left at a
[SPEAKER_03]: crime scene, you can do the same thing for
a plant or any person or any organism.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all have unique genetic fingerprints.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in the, in the process of
establishing these genetic fingerprints,
[SPEAKER_03]: they noticed that some of the plants had
different DNA markers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not different, but additional
ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're able to tease it all apart and
figure out that what happened was there
[SPEAKER_03]: was bacteria that actually had,
that had colonized the plant on the inside
[SPEAKER_03]: and they were living in the, in the cells
and in between the cells of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so, you know, I mean, think about
how that could affect phenotype,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a whole other organism that's,
that's living within your system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and again, the likelihood that like
you said, these are grandfather plants
[SPEAKER_03]: that have been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the likelihood is that they've been
exposed to some kind of either bacteria or
[SPEAKER_03]: viral vector that is compromising either
their growth phenotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that is more likely than
saying that a mutation happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: That said mutations, like we were talking
about the sport, you know, just a minute
[SPEAKER_03]: ago, mutations do happen, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: In plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's really low probability that
they'll happen twice at the same part of
[SPEAKER_03]: the chromosome, but it can happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, um, yeah, it's also possible that
there was a genetic change in a gene that
[SPEAKER_03]: led to some kind of genetic weakness or
inability that plant to grow as fast as it
[SPEAKER_03]: was, you know, just one, one of these
general housekeeping genes that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: keep the plant healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it got mutated in a way that it's
not quite as functional.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, all of those things are possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they inevitable?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they inevitable that they're going to
happen to any given plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like not probably not, you know,
and you can do things, like I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: good cultural practices to minimize the
chance of it happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're really serious about it,
then you've got a nursery where it's a one
[SPEAKER_03]: way thing, you know, things only come out
of the nursery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing goes back in that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not adding bugs or any kind of
disease vectors, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You clean your hands, you sterilize your
gloves, you use new tools every time you
[SPEAKER_03]: cut the plant or you get serious and you
start propagating them in tissue culture.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, and maybe that is the way,
but I think honestly that the way of the
[SPEAKER_03]: future is that the tissue culture will
have its heyday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, when the plant,
the real plant breeders get a chance to
[SPEAKER_03]: run free in these big fields with large
breeding opportunities, and we're using
[SPEAKER_03]: genomic techniques that we're going to be
able to make these plants quite uniform
[SPEAKER_03]: and quite chemically uniform.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'll be able to grow them from
seed as if they were clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not going to be clones,
but, but every plant will look more or
[SPEAKER_03]: less the same to the point where you can
either use it all for a true to type
[SPEAKER_03]: extract or, you know, eventually we'll
have the flower morphology nailed as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll be able to grow them from seed
and they'll look like clones and then you
[SPEAKER_03]: won't have to deal with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: With any of the problems of keeping
mothers, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll just buy your seed and plant it and
harvest and the next year you'll buy more
[SPEAKER_03]: seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like they do with corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there we have it guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part two of three done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two thirds of the way there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One third left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you get back in to join us for
that last part, that informational hitter
[SPEAKER_00]: with Chimera.
