[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, alright, alright, welcome back my
friends for another episode of Not In My
[SPEAKER_00]: Bag, your number one news spot for all
things cannabis, discussion, recent events
[SPEAKER_00]: and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, you're joined by your boys,
Mean Gene of Mendocino, Heavy Days from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Upside Down Library and on today,
we are thrilled to be joined by a man who
[SPEAKER_00]: memes harder than Mean Gene himself,
dare I say it, the sticker captain and
[SPEAKER_00]: connoisseur, the OG in the die cut game
and the man behind all those incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: bags you've no doubt at least seen and
maybe even purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big welcome to Mr. Sticker Farmer for
joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a quick one today,
he'll be back for another app,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty, hello and welcome to the second
episode of Not In My Bag, your number one
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis news and current affairs
discussion show.
[SPEAKER_00]: As usual, I'm grateful to be joined by my
co-host with the most, Mr. Mean Gene of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino and on today's episode,
we are extremely thrilled to be joined by
[SPEAKER_00]: a huge name in the industry, a guy who
memes maybe even harder than Mean Gene,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is hard to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: A massive thank you to Sticker Farmer for
joining us on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big compliment comparing me to
Gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little out of my league there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You meme way harder than me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I meme here and there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to have a little bit of memeing
going on, but you got some threads on
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some epic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might put up more memes than you,
but your memes hit pretty hard and you've
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely been someone that inspired me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened here?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was certainly my favorite post of
recent, so I've got to give a shout out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a funny one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you buy stickers, they're packaging for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I got the little spelling error at
the end, which always attracts a little
[SPEAKER_02]: extra attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got me with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what just popped up on the
screen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well played.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are joined by meme royalty and I'm
incredibly grateful, but as always,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's start off by asking, what's everyone
been smoking on recently?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's in the fatty you got there,
Farmer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, this was actually given to me by the
boys at Candies down in SoCal,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is actually a turpline.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the weed before it's been infused.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's top notch, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top notch, high powered weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be surprised what they're spraying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is already going off on a tangent
with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When those particular dudes infuse it,
are they infusing it with weed terpenes
[SPEAKER_03]: from a different strain or is it like
fruit terpenes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, before we go into it,
I'll say that I don't know, but what I
[SPEAKER_02]: would be speaking on is what my
understanding of it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's something along the lines
of the vape juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same stuff that they use the vape
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure the comments or whatever would
correct me and I could be wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely not my specialty and I
wouldn't want to speak out of line on that
[SPEAKER_02]: subject particularly right now while it's
so hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bunch of flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole bunch of flavors in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marshmallow, butterscotch, berry,
all these flavors and they mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: They match all the flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not weed flavors, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is fruit flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is snack flavors and dessert flavors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That I know for sure and I'm sure there's
different levels of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a buddy back in the day in the 90s,
my buddy, little Billy.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to make hash oil and he would use
this overproof liqueur.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like if you ever drank like in the
back in the day, like 100 proof like
[SPEAKER_03]: permafrost or hot damn 100 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like blackberry liqueur,
but it was high proof though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a lot of sugar and flavor in it,
but it also had a lot of alcohol in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could use it to extract weed the way
you would with regular alcohol,
[SPEAKER_03]: but where regular alcohol leaves and
leaves you only with whatever the resin
[SPEAKER_03]: was, it would also leave behind sugar and
blackberry flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it was doing to the
lungs or whatever, but we used to take it
[SPEAKER_03]: and put it on rolling papers and roll
joints with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the sugar burned, it was delicious.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a weird thing because I was like,
I know it's probably not the best thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's like if you've ever smoked shisha
in the hookah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you smoke hookah at a hookah bar,
it tastes like strawberry jam or it'll
[SPEAKER_03]: taste like whatever the different shisha
tastes like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's along that same line.
[SPEAKER_03]: My only real concern always is I know
straight trappers might be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude, let's just take whatever and let's
just go buy some shit out of the air
[SPEAKER_03]: freshener aisle and put this in these
pounds and I'll bet they'll move.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I know there's got to be other dudes
too who are probably like, hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's actually have a dude at a lab like
our buddy, crybaby sent me a kit that has
[SPEAKER_03]: all these really high grade, it has
ketones.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this particular ketone which is
different to my understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a terpene, but it's like it,
it makes things taste and smell and it
[SPEAKER_03]: smells like raspberry vanilla.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just smells crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that that would probably taste
really good if you put it on some weed and
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's sourced really high grade,
then it's only a matter of you're just
[SPEAKER_03]: adding something to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always curious about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I asked you because I don't,
like I won't say I don't know anybody
[SPEAKER_03]: who's infused some packs, but I don't
really know the details of how it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: done and so I was curious about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a professional process.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a garage process whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is medical grade devices that are
doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have showed these machines online.
[SPEAKER_02]: They resemble something like a
refrigerator and they have shelves and
[SPEAKER_02]: they put the thing in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think at first I even myself just
pictured some homies in the garage just
[SPEAKER_02]: getting busy with some whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little more to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff that is being put on the weed
is already intended to be smoked,
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do the flavored bloods.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do the peach optimos and the grape
swishers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The peaches and cream and all these
tobacco blended flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very oily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when you smell it, you can tell it's
oily.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet it has a different texture when you
touch the tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only come in contact with weed that I
know was infused one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go up and down the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see all types of people that are heavily
involved in all types of different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only come into contact with it one
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In California, I can tell you it's not
very popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that work for me, for example,
when I show it to them, they're surprised
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're not seeing this stuff out
here in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a different demographic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting how much it seems to have
taken over the East Coast predominantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a side note, I noticed there's now
a podcast dedicated to just rating sprayed
[SPEAKER_00]: packs, which I think is a good indicator
of how prevalent it's becoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the question I'd love to quickly
throw out there is, do you think that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost certain at this point that it's
just going to become the next most
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant thing, or do you think it'll have
its rise and fall off?
[SPEAKER_02]: It already is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether people want to accept that or not,
I have a bird's eye view of the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I happen to know a whole bunch of
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell what's popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see it when it's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see it when it's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, I'd say it's still going up.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It still has some growth in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the whole Runts movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw how long that lasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the explosion of carts a few years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw how long that lasted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have a few other things to compare
this wave to.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I have not seen the money move
like it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Dom's Doobies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to young Jack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to OJ and the White Bronco
Nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't beat some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: God, we've got to pick your brain a bit
because that's exactly what me and Gene
[SPEAKER_00]: and I were talking about a bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy has a bird's eye view of the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just before we move on, you just mentioned
you got an idea of the next up and coming
[SPEAKER_00]: trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think might be the next thing,
or do you think it'll be another iteration
[SPEAKER_00]: of something we already have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the first real branding wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get ahead of dime bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get ahead of Ziploc bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to branding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That came in glass jars.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was for me, lemon tree, Golden State
bananas, stuff's coming out of Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: The jar thing exploded pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That switched over to those little tins,
little tin cans.
[SPEAKER_02]: That got very popular for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tin cans turned into sticker bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sticker bags turned into directly printed
bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Directly printed bags turned into die-cut
bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Die-cut bags go into a box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we circle back to double-sided
sticker bags, which is the current
[SPEAKER_02]: humongous wave right now, which is great
for sticker farmer because we're built for
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're the first ones to do the sticker bag
wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: That made it good for us when it became
popular again because I already had the
[SPEAKER_02]: infrastructure to work off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next thing, if I knew I'd be rich
already, I could tell you that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the packaging is gonna get more
complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the layers and the levels that
they're doing, the packaging you're seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: right now, I'm working on projects right
now to sell one-eighth, 127 pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that sound was,
but 127 pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: To sell one-eighth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking box, bags, everything you
could imagine to sell one-eighth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The level this shit's going to is like we
don't even know yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: New York right now, the New York
demographic is controlling what everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of has to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely some very influential
trappers on the East Coast who are having
[SPEAKER_02]: a heavy hand in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then obviously the customer decides what's
hot and what's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an incredible little anthology of the
evolving of it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot about the tuna tins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for reminding me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were certainly a big part in it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to touch back on that a bit
later in the episode, but why don't we
[SPEAKER_00]: jump into our first story, which is
everyone's been talking about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: DEA has recently announced that they and
the Department of Justice plan to
[SPEAKER_00]: reschedule cannabis to a schedule three
drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: This signifies that they believe it's a
low risk substance and it's in line with
[SPEAKER_00]: other medications such as Tylenol with
codeine in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say the reschedule is likely going to
take a couple of months to complete the
[SPEAKER_00]: process, but it certainly is paving the
way for what many speculators suggest will
[SPEAKER_00]: be one step closer to federal
legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the bare minimum, you can feel like the
war on drugs is almost at an end.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you guys think about the
rescheduling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think this is going to usher in a
new wave of cannabis as people hope,
[SPEAKER_00]: or do you think to an extent it's still
same old, same old?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what are you hearing about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I hearing?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it's hard because you hear these
things every two or three weeks to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, so and so agrees to this or this group
agrees to this and now this group agrees
[SPEAKER_02]: to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like the marketing school.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making us feel like something's
coming, you know, but you know what that
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's really hard, really hard to
tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see naturally the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: People want to be excited about it because
it sounds good to have 50 states that play
[SPEAKER_02]: ball, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But just like we saw in the last few
years, it's not always good for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulations bad for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody, but gradually it's pretty
bad for most people, especially the mom
[SPEAKER_02]: and pop, small farms, things like that,
the heavy taxation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's inevitable because we're an
industry and they're not going to just
[SPEAKER_02]: have an industry that just gets to have a
free for all and do whatever the fuck it
[SPEAKER_02]: wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if we want to be part of the
banks, if we want to be part of all these
[SPEAKER_02]: other things that we're kind of like and
like push to the side of, then you got to
[SPEAKER_02]: be part of the taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be part of the regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The government's definitely going to have
their own heavy hand in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to me, is it fair?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think is the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the question is, is it natural
progression for an industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it seems like that's what's
supposed to be happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do say I do think there's going to be
some things about it that do affect the
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller farms that, you know, in
particular are in California, because
[SPEAKER_02]: these are people that I'm friends with and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would hate to see them lose their
license or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because now all of a sudden you have to be
federally regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the things that we're yet to
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a comment on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what I really ultimately said
was that I hope it creates opportunity and
[SPEAKER_02]: however people want to take that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think I think like all everything
you said is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a matter of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, like it's real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it should be like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can always do that with like,
you know, I got a kid and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like always it's always like trying
to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah, I mean, that would be
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's not how things are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, people say, well,
this isn't fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I don't really know many things
that are that fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's things are fair to an
extent.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's very few of them, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, you're always going to have
the the, you know, like you said,
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's going to be an industry and it's
going to be a business, you're naturally
[SPEAKER_03]: going to go towards that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me, I've always been like, yeah,
everybody fucked up having it be
[SPEAKER_03]: mainstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, like, you know,
it was bound to be mainstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was only some weird little events that
kept it being what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think like the the what it really
comes down to is like, if you really want
[SPEAKER_03]: to have some weed and you don't want any
of the any of the other stuff attached to
[SPEAKER_03]: it, like just grow your own weed,
have your own weed, trade it with people,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and, you know, like,
try to try to be cool about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tell everybody you're growing and
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it comes down to being like overly
regulated, where it goes back to being
[SPEAKER_03]: basically illegal for the average citizen
again, you know, it's like, all right,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, keep it on the under, you know,
like, don't don't just, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't you you can't be like this is
kind of funny, but I remember there was a
[SPEAKER_03]: there was a time when I was getting
really, really high and we were we were
[SPEAKER_03]: actually doing nitrous and I kind of like
snapped out for a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I came back and I had this weird
thing and I was like, oh, damn,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, there's like this thing where
you can be way down here and you're all
[SPEAKER_03]: good and you can be way up here and you're
all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're right in here in the middle,
they're going to fuck you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like I kind of like kind of like
came back to consciousness saying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody was like, what the fuck are
you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was so clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just knew it was like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now over the years, I've kind of
realized it's like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like if you, you know, there's going
to be the people who are really big and
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll be OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be the people who are
really little and they'll be OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're in the middle, then you kind
of have to you're going to have to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: get up there or down there and either get
really organized and figure out what
[SPEAKER_03]: people are doing at a level higher than
you or go ahead and go, OK, I'm content to
[SPEAKER_03]: stay at this lower level where it's not
where it's not as big of a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think with this kind of a thing,
depending on how they interpret the law,
[SPEAKER_03]: it could make it to where like a lot of
our friends and people who are not super
[SPEAKER_03]: ambitious and don't have the most
resources, they'll have to just kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: be, you know, small time and keep it that
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the people who really which are
also some of our friends who have more
[SPEAKER_03]: ambition and want to really like push and
get big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, maybe it'll be more
opportunity for them because now it is
[SPEAKER_03]: banking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is maybe federal, international,
all these opportunities for everything to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow and actually like block.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it would be really cool if it
kind of allows everything to go as it's
[SPEAKER_03]: been.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe over time, they give a little
bit of extra power to the localities,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, OK, to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, like if you're, you know, once it's
more fully regulated, that might also mean
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's some areas where that
regulation is less, you know, to where
[SPEAKER_03]: like they might go, hey, look,
people have been growing in NorCal and
[SPEAKER_03]: wherever Santa Cruz or whatever for this
long.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go ahead and and ease
things up in those areas and make like an
[SPEAKER_03]: available permit for small farms or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: If that could get lobbied for and change,
that'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, in the meantime,
I think it's going to be like like you
[SPEAKER_03]: said, we don't really know, but you kind
of have to expect that it's going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: more and more complicated and you're going
to have to be more and more people
[SPEAKER_03]: professional if you do want to be way up
on that level than than right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: because right now people can as long as
they bust their ass and they jump through
[SPEAKER_03]: some loops, they can get pretty high right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they change it to where you need to
get every product cleared by the FDA and
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to go through this process to it
could cut, you know, it could could change
[SPEAKER_03]: that way, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a trippy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a trippy thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like I don't think anybody can call
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, like you said, hopefully
it's good for some people, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you said, it's a bit ambiguous and got
to give a shout out to the nitrous
[SPEAKER_00]: epiphany you just described.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds epic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had some of those ones where like you
eat some shrooms and you're like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a notepad because I know this is
actually I just figured some crazy shit
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like you sober up and you're
like, I don't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there was a thing or like you wake
up from a dream and you go, I got to
[SPEAKER_03]: remember that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like that's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was one of the few that I really
remembered.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for some reason, it like it didn't it
really didn't make much sense then,
[SPEAKER_03]: except at the time I was thinking of the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually thinking about like big
fish and little fish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like people either have to be
like, if you're a shark, you're cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're a minnow, you're cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, you know, the the tune is
getting fished out like there's just not,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an analogy, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, while we're on the topic of
the rescheduling, there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: focal discussion regarding what does this
mean in terms of some of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: patents that we've seen over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And notably, we do see the pharmaceutical
companies moving in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's already several big ones launching
patent applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sanofi, Merrick, GW Pharmaceutical,
Pfizer, all of these companies have
[SPEAKER_00]: launched between 25 and 50 patent
applications or have been granted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these companies have also been
implicated or at least played an adjunct
[SPEAKER_00]: role in the opioid epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have any concerns about the the
rapid rise in companies launching these
[SPEAKER_00]: patents in the wake of what seems like
possible future legalization?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, the weirdest ones are when
they when you read the patents and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: like, we have a patent for cannabis that
produces one to one ratio CBD to THC or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, how is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really like novel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what they might have to do,
which is unfortunate, is to patent things
[SPEAKER_03]: to really get them to go through.
[SPEAKER_03]: They might have to actually modify them
and go, OK, you can tell this is ours
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's basically got our stamp in
the DNA.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just test it and be like, boom,
it's Merck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom, it's Pfizer or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like as soon as it comes back from the DNA
test, it's like, yeah, that's that one is
[SPEAKER_03]: ours, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is it would be really weird now if
they started granting all these weird ones
[SPEAKER_03]: like where they're like it turns purple
and it smells like such and such or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, because there were some weird
ones filed like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone was like, you can't they
won't push any of them through yet in the
[SPEAKER_03]: US.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they do start and they push some of
those through, it takes a lot of money to
[SPEAKER_03]: get them pushed through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it takes a lot of money to fight
against them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's not a lot of people who are
going to want to spend tons of money to
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure that other people can't get
those patents.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like it could be kind of
it could be kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that could be a big driver of that
thing that I was saying, where like you
[SPEAKER_03]: might have to either be GW Pharma or you
might have to have a backpack and sell
[SPEAKER_03]: sacks, you know, in which case I think
people could sell sacks and still be OK,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but you're not going to be like
GW Pharma Jr., because you're not I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know how you're going to get there,
you know, but it'll be interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: How's that going to play out?
[SPEAKER_00]: And either way, all your sticker needs can
be filled by Sticker Pharma, whether
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a backpack boy or GW Pharma.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, legal in every state,
internationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of it for us is some of the
challenging things for your traditional
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis businesses are bonuses for mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they change regulation and they
need to upgrade all their packaging,
[SPEAKER_02]: they call me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't create the regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just sell what they need to be in
compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's it's part of one of
those things where sometimes I may see
[SPEAKER_02]: something I may want to celebrate and it's
insulting to a mom and pop who's taking a
[SPEAKER_02]: big hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking get it, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, we're we're kind of like
fishing for different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, sometimes my fish might and
sometimes your fish might.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just part of part of the business
and, you know, part of selling the picks
[SPEAKER_02]: and shovels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like I said, you know,
people like, oh, well, that's not fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, yeah, that's life's not fair.
[SPEAKER_03]: You you bet on this horse or you bet on
that horse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like at a time when everybody thought you
were nuts, probably for going,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, stickers, you know, I understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I had seen like even hippies when
I was a little kid go, oh, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: put this sticker on a jar and I'm going to
have like a mason jar with weed in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to people are going to buy
my ounces for five hundred because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be just like three buds in a
mason jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got my sticker and a super simple
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when they did it, you looked at it,
you go, well, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But nobody wanted to do it because when it
was completely illegal, 100 percent,
[SPEAKER_03]: all that is is your fingerprint on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you go, oh, I'm going to put this
on the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody goes, oh, I'm going to make
this and I'm going to put this stamp on
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like now everybody knows what that
is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can all be tracked back to somebody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before like two fifteen, people didn't
really want to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people started to do go,
oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get a roll of stickers made
and I'm going to stick them on my turkey
[SPEAKER_03]: bags or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you know, you guys started making
like actually real packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, like you said earlier,
following like, OK, like I the first
[SPEAKER_03]: packaging that I got from you guys and the
only packaging that I ever got for legal
[SPEAKER_03]: wreck flower was flats of jars that were
like eighth jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could put a border in them or you
could put an eighth in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were nice little jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like the bottom of this,
basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And nice labeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have my flats and all my stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went to take those to the Emerald
Cup and sell them at a booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, damn, this dolly with like
five pounds of weed on it, it weighs like
[SPEAKER_03]: one hundred pounds or it weighs like
whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It weighed a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as soon as I saw that, I was like,
yeah, people aren't going to want to do
[SPEAKER_03]: jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I saw why people wanted to do
tin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then everybody's like, oh,
I want my weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody now that's like stuck with the
old thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was talking about the mason jar
with the three buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: That all sounds cool until you actually go
to go through the logistics of the
[SPEAKER_03]: shipping and all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the things I've heard
before about packaging with glass was back
[SPEAKER_03]: in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: People would go, oh, put everything in
glass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's recyclable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of times it doesn't get
recycled.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets thrown in the trash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to ship it, it uses so much more fuel
that it's actually a crazy resource
[SPEAKER_03]: expense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just on our, just on the world's
resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of resources to go,
I'm going to put it in glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, 35 pounds, 35 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's around 30, depending on which jar you
have, which lid you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're, you're, you're into logistical
fucking nightmare.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're talking about a high
quality product, you might want to
[SPEAKER_02]: transport it in a high quality container.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I still think some of the best weeds
and jars, just like the best tequila.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tequila is in a bottle and all of those
fees are easily absorbed at the top of
[SPEAKER_02]: food chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everyone can afford to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not recommend it unless you're built
for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of those things where like,
for me, I knew for what I was doing,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I can put it in jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already have the option at the time,
put it in bags, put it in jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, no, I want to put mine in
jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You open up the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see it through the jar.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, and had I continued to get,
keep getting stuff, I might've just kept
[SPEAKER_03]: on getting it in jars.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also saw that I was like,
damn, like, this is just it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the way it sounds in your head and
the way it really is when you're actually
[SPEAKER_03]: holding onto them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I get, um, I get, uh,
seed packaging from you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, maybe I'm going to do
tins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'll do like, like it would be cool
to do like mini cigar boxes with the lid
[SPEAKER_03]: that flips up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, like you guys could get me
whatever I want to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, it's, it's like, you guys are
the homies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really easy to work through design
process, do all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, and then I, you know,
I like to support people that I know are
[SPEAKER_03]: people who I at least know are like
grassroots, you know, smaller businesses
[SPEAKER_03]: came from the weed stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, it, I just looked at it and I was
like, Oh, I don't really want to use
[SPEAKER_03]: plastic because I don't really like having
the waste of plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I, you know, I looked at all the
different stuff and all said and done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I get people's packaging and
it's big and it takes up all this space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like with seeds, I take them all and I
put them in my fridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I get people's packaging in these nice
boxes or whatever they come in and I take
[SPEAKER_03]: it and I put it in a little plastic bag
and I put those all in these areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're tight tubs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people make this really nice,
uh, packaging and then I get the seeds and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I can't, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I went, okay, I'm just going to,
with my seeds, I'm just going to go ahead
[SPEAKER_03]: and put them straight in the, in the
little, in the little direct printed,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, my Lars, you know, which was,
which was awesome for me, but it's just a
[SPEAKER_03]: trip like the, uh, you know, when you go
to, when you go to do things like you
[SPEAKER_03]: actually, you actually get your hands on
it and you go, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this happens and that happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had seeds and I did little,
little paper folds with a little Ziploc
[SPEAKER_03]: inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went, okay, now this has to be put
in an airtight container.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I need to figure out, okay,
something needs to be crush proof and all
[SPEAKER_03]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, it's all, uh, it's all a
trippy process figuring out all the
[SPEAKER_03]: logistics for all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's fun though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's got different stuff going on
and it's definitely part of what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what, uh, makes it interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely the packaging game itself spurs
its own sort of creativity, but in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your answer, you referenced,
you know, sort of the homegrown,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, original sort of packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, while we're on the topic of
grassroots, I wanted to quickly mention,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, last month, four 20, the famous four
20 event at, uh, golden state park was
[SPEAKER_00]: called hippie hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly didn't go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this was due to the organizers being
unable to secure enough sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cited other problems as well,
such as the city having cutbacks,
[SPEAKER_00]: which meant that they weren't able to
secure funding to be able to run the event
[SPEAKER_00]: safely in terms of say police medical
staff and other utilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some have been critical of this
saying that the event really doesn't need
[SPEAKER_00]: that much infrastructure to run and the
vendors were still keen to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, however, there was a response from the
organizers, which said, look, last year
[SPEAKER_00]: there was 40,000 people in a relatively
small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, without the appropriate funding,
we were just going to trash the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, in 2019, there was sadly some
fentanyl laced brownies that went around
[SPEAKER_00]: and 10 people overdosed within the first
hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the presence of medical personnel
seems like it would be highly
[SPEAKER_00]: advantageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question though, is what does this say
for the homegrown events?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an extension, do we think that
decriminalization and possible
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization is sort of going to actually
be problematic in a sense, because it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like the event organizers sort of
attributed the fact that there was so much
[SPEAKER_00]: interest in the event that they weren't
able to safely facilitate the event going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we think this could be a bad sign for
some of the more organic events?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'll answer that from my point of
view, not everything is meant to be
[SPEAKER_02]: monetized.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some things are better just left
organic and left alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cool when the hippies were out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have friends that used to go out and
spend two or three days making cookies and
[SPEAKER_02]: go out and everybody just said,
it's like, it didn't need fences.
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't need stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: It probably did need bathrooms and,
um, waste management to some extent,
[SPEAKER_02]: which the city should be happy to provide
when people are, you know, gathering,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, peacefully like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a huge part of the culture in San
Francisco and the point when they tried to
[SPEAKER_02]: monetize it didn't sit well with me
personally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was just kind of a cool,
a cool party.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think, I don't know if,
if people are, if people are doing it,
[SPEAKER_03]: if people are going, it's like,
you know, if, if you really, like you
[SPEAKER_03]: said, the one thing that I can think where
you need money for it would be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's everybody going to go to the
bathroom?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the main, main thing that
always is with a big, big event,
[SPEAKER_03]: like you're going to have to have some
rows of porta potty somewhere or
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, it's like all of it,
you know, seems like you should be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: just do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, people who want to
take part in it should be able to keep it
[SPEAKER_03]: all cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you should be able to be cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you have a party.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually a lot of people come to the party.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like a small party, like a house
party, everybody comes, everybody leaves,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's always like those two or three
homies that are like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: We cleaned everything up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We vacuumed everything up.
[SPEAKER_03]: People stayed late, people, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always weird to me to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I remember seeing when they did one
of the high times there and it was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything was done and over and there was
nobody there anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was still, you could look
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was still like 20 dumpsters laying
out on the field.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wherever it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, this is wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like who, who the fuck does this?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because people suck,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the people to the promoters who did
try to organize it and clean it up and
[SPEAKER_02]: shout out to them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately people are not cool
enough to know things that big need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: like sanctioned to some extent or whatever
the word is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if, if you know it's going to go on,
you need to kind of be like, all right,
[SPEAKER_03]: we got a crew that's going to be,
we got, you know, whatever garbage crew,
[SPEAKER_03]: recycling crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like it, it's just, if you are,
if it's organized in any sense,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course, if everyone just shows up and
it's like, well, who's, whose job is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, back in the day, honestly,
especially in a place called hippie hill,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you had hippies and you had weed people
and you know, whatever kind of people
[SPEAKER_03]: coming out to things like that,
there would be like, stuff would be,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I grew up where we'd have like
big, when I was a little kid, like big,
[SPEAKER_03]: like full moon parties at the river.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it would be like, there's like food
and a lot of people don't bring food,
[SPEAKER_03]: but a lot of people bring more food than
they need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people don't clean shit up,
but you got those few people that are
[SPEAKER_03]: like, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool for everybody to be able to just
come and do their thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't have to worry about food.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't have to worry about cleanup.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like what, that's going to be our
part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe somebody comes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And does some music or people do whatever,
but like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just crazy how you can get so many
people together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's not like, you don't like,
you don't need one person can take care of
[SPEAKER_03]: a couple thousand people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just need like a few people to be
like, all right, we're going to do this,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's not in just in relation to
hippie hill, but as far as events,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like people have the,
we have it in us to have really cool
[SPEAKER_03]: festivals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And events and be able to pull off some
crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, like the only thing really going
on like that, I think that is still,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know, cause I don't go and
I'm sure everybody who went early on would
[SPEAKER_03]: say would have their critique,
but like Burning Man, all these people go,
[SPEAKER_03]: they make a city and when they leave,
there's just nothing there, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it seems like you could do that
anywhere with anything, but unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like I go to the river now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, somebody left a bag of beer
bottles and dirty diapers at the swimming
[SPEAKER_03]: hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, where's the overlap with the
people who actually want to do some cool
[SPEAKER_03]: shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they think you just leave some
bullshit there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one of those things, you know,
it makes it difficult for everybody to
[SPEAKER_03]: keep shit together when you got those
kinds of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonder what town they're from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm guessing maybe the one down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in your answer, you referenced,
you know, one of the prior high times
[SPEAKER_00]: events and you know, how people sort of
didn't pull their weight there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, you gave me a perfect
segue because in surprise, as news high
[SPEAKER_00]: times has gone into receivership.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me pull up our little image.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last time we spoke, we had no idea
about this, but it's come to light that
[SPEAKER_00]: high times has actually been struggling
quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company has been navigating murky
waters for the past 10 years since their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis cups and magazine fell out of
favor, largely attributed to poorer
[SPEAKER_00]: quality management and concerns from the
community regarding the authenticity of
[SPEAKER_00]: winners and pay for play antics given high
times is a cannabis company and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: companies aren't federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say they can't file for bankruptcy,
but they are able to go into receivership.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they get bailed out or may this be
the end of high times as we know it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the question is, do we think high
times is worth saving as a legacy brand or
[SPEAKER_00]: has the scene progressed on too much?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think about this one,
Mr. Sticker Farmer?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you grow up on high times at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: More than you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gee, they're right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a collage I made out of high times
when I was in high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the name of the brand I was making
at the time, 1996.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cut out of a high times magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the back of it is a letter from a
fucking art teacher telling me to stop
[SPEAKER_02]: making weed art.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I keep this in my house.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this lady probably also inspired
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably don't give her enough credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always bad mouthing her for this
letter.
[SPEAKER_02]: She wrote me about making weed art.
[SPEAKER_02]: High times, huge subject matter in my
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's fast forward to what we're talking
about now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that ship hasn't been driven
by the best captain for quite some time
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: A ton of very dope culture behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And probably the pay to play events and
some of those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think they crossed over into like
dispensaries and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I drive down the highway and there's a
dispensary in Oakland and it's high times
[SPEAKER_02]: building and it's covered in fucking
plywood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say that's a sign of the times,
not only for, you know, things going on in
[SPEAKER_02]: our cities, but also for the brand,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plywood it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a bummer, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it really is like, you know,
I mean, I remember being a teenager and
[SPEAKER_03]: being like, like if someone told you like,
oh dude, my picture got in high times,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd be like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got your picture in high times?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I remember it was like 2000,
I want to say 2002 or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: My buddy, Maul, Jay Meddy, we took
pictures in his mom's backyard and he sent
[SPEAKER_03]: them in of these Meddy plants and they got
put in high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we were like, whoa, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, it was just, it was the
coolest thing ever, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, you know, it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think in general now, magazines are
not like, you know, I mean, there's the
[SPEAKER_03]: internet, but like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still get love from high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: They post pictures of mine and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I get like, it really boosts my
IG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like people there are cool with me and
ask me questions to check on articles,
[SPEAKER_03]: check details and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just funny because like,
as time goes on, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's like it being like a frog in
a pot of water and it warm it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I'm like, yeah, somebody from high
times, cool, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, it's just a weird thing because
like I said, 20 something years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a picture is in there with our
faces covered up and only we know it's us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're like, dude, we're famous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not really, but like, we felt like,
damn, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: These pictures are in a big magazine and
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but I don't think it only happened
like to me personally being jaded by the
[SPEAKER_03]: weed thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think also people in general don't,
they don't regard, it's like, there's so
[SPEAKER_03]: much exposure all the time to all this
stuff that people don't regard any of it
[SPEAKER_03]: that much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like somebody could like share
your, somebody could share your meme or
[SPEAKER_03]: something on a page that has 10 million
follows and you'd be like, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to have a lot more, it used to
hold a lot more mystique for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be a lot more like,
it was like, it was next to like the
[SPEAKER_02]: Cornell mags, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now you could go on your phone and
find either readily available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think we're jaded to not only
the fact that, you know, the stuff is
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere and we've seen a zillion
pictures by now, but high times was a shit
[SPEAKER_02]: for me, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: High times I put in a very high regard and
I think they probably inspired a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people to not be afraid to play with weed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like as a grower, I used to be
scouring it like, Oh, is there a tip like
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that somebody said that sounded
like it might be something cool that you
[SPEAKER_03]: never thought of?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, damn, I should try that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the answer to something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you listen and you're like,
you use your critical thinking and you go
[SPEAKER_03]: that solved that right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I needed to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you might only be every once in a
while, but back then there was nowhere
[SPEAKER_03]: else to get that unless you like go and
talk to somebody and you didn't feel
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you knew somebody was like an old
schooler that knew a lot, you weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: like, Hey, tell me what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it was like, you knew it was kinda
stepping on toes is kind of trade secrets
[SPEAKER_03]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like back to the, the thing of like
being jaded with stuff, it's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I don't even think like,
I look at it and I go, Oh, magazines or
[SPEAKER_03]: what the media or newspapers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I look at it now too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go, it seems like because of
overexposure to everything, like it almost
[SPEAKER_03]: has happened with almost everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you show somebody some real trippy
kind of fruit, they're like, Oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I seen this one on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: I followed this dude in Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, back in the day you'd be
like, dude, what the hell is a soursop?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now people are like, yeah, it's a soursop.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ordered one on the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came in two days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, like weed is the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the way that we used to look at weed
and you get one little nug of something
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're just like, dude, what the hell
it made like things be so everything could
[SPEAKER_03]: be legendary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now at this point you're kind of like,
there's the craziest things in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody's just kind of like,
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's weird, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to have a bookshelf of
encyclopedias as a kid and I would look
[SPEAKER_02]: through them for cool animals,
you know, and that's how I saw cool
[SPEAKER_02]: animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I can go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I mean, I was happy with Steve
Irwin, you know, I was happy with
[SPEAKER_02]: crocodile hunter and now you can go on
Instagram and see all the exotic animals,
[SPEAKER_02]: the snakes and birds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, our exposure level has
been turned way up and now we're harder to
[SPEAKER_02]: impress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's trippy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you're like a media company,
like high times, you're not ridiculously
[SPEAKER_03]: on top of it as far as whatever's going on
with management.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and I don't even look at it
and go, oh, these guys are somebody's a
[SPEAKER_03]: fuck up or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I know I personally couldn't
keep like, don't hand me high times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll fuck it off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Guarantee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to just, just to manage all the
different details of all of it and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it's just, yeah,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's one of those, it's one of those
things where I don't know that it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know it can be kept alive and
I'd like to see it, but it, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you figure, you know that there's problems
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be problems with the management
because it's so big.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's this monster.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so respected.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so legendary to a whole few
generations of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's like, it's flopping.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, something's wrong there,
but at the same time you wonder too,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, okay, it would have to be even if
everyone's doing everything perfectly in
[SPEAKER_03]: this day and age, it's still kind of hard
to keep something like that alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I personally hope that it turns
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything goes through waves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like, you know, people go through
waves in their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, Oh, you got a friend and you
see him and you're like, damn,
[SPEAKER_03]: he's all manic and everything's fucked off
and going crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you see him again and you're
like, Oh, yeah, dude's doing good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, you knew some dude who was
like this legendary dude from back in the
[SPEAKER_03]: day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you see him and he's been through
some shit and he's just like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: people are all swollen and their,
their aura is all gray and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and then like, then they bounce
back and you know, you hope with
[SPEAKER_03]: everything, like I always want to see
everything do better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like doing better is better.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's whatever it is, but high times in
particular, I'd like to see it be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: bounce back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see cool high times cups.
[SPEAKER_03]: That used to be like something where I
like really was curious what won.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course there is a lot of,
you know, there's like ever since the
[SPEAKER_03]: basically the eighties, the dudes from
like Shanti Baba and those guys,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're like, yeah, it was being bought.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was being bought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you buy the cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how that worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also had good friends who I know for
a fact, they didn't have a name.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have a booth.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had some weed that was so good that
you could, they couldn't even,
[SPEAKER_03]: they were just like, we got to give this
guy first in the car or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know a few people who,
who by the metric of it being bought,
[SPEAKER_03]: they shouldn't have won and they won.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even while it was funky, there was
still some, some, some reality going on
[SPEAKER_03]: with the judging and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so knowing that from knowing those
people, it made me be like, all right,
[SPEAKER_03]: so what did win?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm always curious about what
wins because somebody liked it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was good enough that everybody's
not like, dude, what, what happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always like, you know, a lot of guys
got some really good weed and whoever got
[SPEAKER_03]: the biggest booth or whatever,
they gave it to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, so it's still some upper
crust shit, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but it would be cool to see it like,
actually like, all right, here's our new
[SPEAKER_03]: standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to make it transparent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a crowd judged and
everybody puts the token with the one they
[SPEAKER_03]: liked the best first place and whoever
gets the most first place at wins.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's somebody doing one like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounded cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be cool to see it all balanced back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biggest sponsor, biggest sponsor won first
place every time for the last five years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's not surprising.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's how a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every, every event.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never saw it go any other way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, I'm sure there's some of
these other ones that don't operate like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, but as far as the big boys that were
using marketing tools and paying money and
[SPEAKER_02]: charging a lot of money for people to be
part of it and filling, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: large venues, like this shit was a fucking
scam, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, it would be cool if it was
all, you know, if it could all be
[SPEAKER_03]: transparent and then you really know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the funny thing is for me personally,
even after, even if I know something isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: fixed and it's all legit, I'm still not
like, I'm like always curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, who won?
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see that, but I'm never like,
Oh, I need to get that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the new wave.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always like, no, I know that I still
like this old weed that I've had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Traditional, traditional custody looks on
the packaging and sees award winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five time cannabis cup winning.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see that and they respond to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People pay money to be part of marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that not all makes plenty of sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, like if people go to buy
a wine, they're like, Oh, this wine has 93
[SPEAKER_03]: points.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was, but people don't even know
that that scale has to be designed on how
[SPEAKER_03]: they grade it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if what you like is not included in
that, in that grading scale, then you
[SPEAKER_03]: might like the 72 point wine better than
the 94 point wine, because you don't like
[SPEAKER_03]: what they like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are like, no, I like really
sweet wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are like, I want to put ice
cubes in my red wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all different things and everybody
will go, Oh, it's cause you don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, a lot of people are like,
sorry, I know a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a lot of different kinds of
cheese.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still will take American cheese on a
burger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I think it's popping on a burger,
you know, like there's things where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like, yeah, it's all, it's all relative,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone likes something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, I don't mean to cut you off,
but I got some family showing up now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to get dinner ready for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to do this again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this is a super dope little platform
you have here, not little platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry to put it that way, but,
um, I've never done anything like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is cool and convenient for me from
home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, please have me back on whenever
it's good for you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there you have it guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, just a quick one today,
we will get Sticker Farmer back to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: much more in-depth episode in the near
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, big shout out for making it to
the end.
