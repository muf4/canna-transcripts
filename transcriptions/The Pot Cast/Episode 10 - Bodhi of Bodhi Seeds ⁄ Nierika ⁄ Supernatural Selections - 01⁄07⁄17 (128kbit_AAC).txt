[SPEAKER_01]: Hello and welcome to the next episode of
The Podcast, a cannabis podcast for
[SPEAKER_01]: budding enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, this episode was brought to us
by 420 Australia, Organic Gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: Solutions and Bodhi Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's gonna be a big one folks,
we're gonna do a two-parter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without further wait...
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, so a big welcome and thank you
to possibly the most prolific breeder in
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being held in more high regard than
probably any other breeder I know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'd love to welcome Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy to have a nice
conversation with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first question I like to start off
every interview with is, what was your
[SPEAKER_02]: first experience with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how did you get introduced to
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh, I mean, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I was a teenager,
people were smoking and I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that was like the mid,
late 80s and there was a lot of good
[SPEAKER_00]: strains around, but I never really
connected with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really into, I was really into like
ancestral shamanic herbalism and so I kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of thought cannabis was just kind of
ho-hum and petty and that's what everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else did and I, you know, I was really
into getting the of the jungle catalog and
[SPEAKER_00]: the Church of Tree of Life and ordering
all these strange and unique plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: try those and I was, you know,
I really enjoyed mushrooms was a big one
[SPEAKER_00]: and cactus and I really never got the full
download from cannabis early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked it once or twice and didn't
really do anything and I really didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: find that deep connection until on one of
my journeys with one of my friends and we
[SPEAKER_00]: were in Belize in the, I think it was
right around the 90s and it was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the, it was a little bit rough and tumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're the only white people there
and you were just, you know, we were,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was 20 and we were just,
we just cruised around and bumbled around,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not a care in the world,
no clue that it's pretty dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like the height of the crack era
and that's when I went through.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend's like, let's get some,
you know, let's get some pot before we go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the, you know, the Mayan ruins and I'm
like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we bumbled around until we found
this Rasta guy and he led us through all
[SPEAKER_00]: these places and I'm sure it was so
sketchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually we got this little foil
wrapped ganja and we, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we paid the guy, we scurried off and we
kept it with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my friend actually, when we finally
made it to, I believe it was Tikal,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's like, hey, do you want to try this
pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, it was when I finally realized
that cannabis is like nature's wifi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it is the plant that allows us
to connect with all of creation on a
[SPEAKER_00]: really subtle, deep human and plant-based
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I really understood that this
is like the link that keeps us bound to
[SPEAKER_00]: our garden planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's almost like our plant ally
supreme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like, I don't even want to
explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, cannabis was good and I
would smoke it here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I really, really got the download
from it when I was in the Himalayas and
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole cultures with the botanists.
[SPEAKER_00]: The babas and the hash and the rubbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I smoked in the Himalayas,
like I was hooked and I knew that this was
[SPEAKER_00]: my, one of my facets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also kind of links back to when I
was doing a lot, ayahuasca and I had these
[SPEAKER_00]: visions in the, you know, in the plant
ayahuasca was like, you know, you're meant
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with plants, but it's not
ayahuasca.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, I mean, these are all stories
within stories that can all be linked up,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's just through a series of deep
reverence for nature and plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It awakened in me this connection with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, I guess that's the first
time would be maybe at those temples.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think for people who maybe have
more of that mainstream connection to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and maybe haven't found their
spiritual connection with it, do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: that maybe trying to participate in,
you know, such an activity would be a good
[SPEAKER_02]: way to try to, you know, reestablish that
link within yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mostly think it's for people that
have kind of lost that link or can't find
[SPEAKER_00]: that link.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think any working with cannabis in
any way, it could be totally mundane.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be spiritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be just commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I always liked the thing now is
like, is all the guys, all the bros now
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow cannabis and basically they're
caring for this female plant and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: creating this relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like almost nourishing their
feminine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting them in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when everybody says, oh, it's a
gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, it's a gateway drug to
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe the fridge and a few other
things, but I think anyway, you interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always wonder, you know,
maybe back in the twenties, if it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: demonized and it wasn't scheduled and it
wasn't run out, what the world would be
[SPEAKER_00]: like today if we had cannabis for like the
last, whatever it was, 180 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would be a totally different world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, I think there'd be a
lot more compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be a lot more art.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be a lot more connection to
nature and each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just this, it's this amazing
force.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of coming back to recall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what we all claim who
we really are as stewards of this amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, I mean, you mentioned mushrooms
and on your Instagram, I've seen things
[SPEAKER_02]: like tobacco and poppies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do these other kinds of
ethnobotanical plants sit in regards to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, do they all kind of sit on the
same shelf or do you use them for
[SPEAKER_02]: different purposes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, they're all tapping
into like a similar place, but on a
[SPEAKER_00]: different kind of wavelength.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I don't really,
I grow poppies once in a while more for
[SPEAKER_00]: the beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a, it's not really my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tobacco, I enjoy to send my prayers up
to the creation matrix, maybe once or
[SPEAKER_00]: twice a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mostly I grow it for the beauty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really is a protector plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love to plant it all around the
house, all around the gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it has a really deep
connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, a lot of times, I know a lot of
people like to smoke cannabis and tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see where, you know, maybe it tweaks
out the flavor and da da da da da,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is a beautiful kind of
connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas tobacco is a very male plant and
cannabis is a very female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put those together and you have
like a potent kind of combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the babas and sadhus in India
and the Himalayas, they mix those two
[SPEAKER_00]: along with other herbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really interesting analogy around
the, you know, the kind of unification of
[SPEAKER_02]: the male and the female.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that mixing tobacco and
cannabis is kind of overall a better for
[SPEAKER_02]: you or it's just better for a certain
purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if that's your, you know,
I think whatever works for people,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever gets them to the place they need
to be to find those realizations is great
[SPEAKER_00]: and beautiful to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just personally for me, I don't usually
mix them unless I'm in a place,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if I'm in the Himalayas a lot of
time, everybody's mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm usually addicted to nicotine by
the time I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the trek, but you know,
they're plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a lot of other plants that
people mix in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a calamus, it's called vacha
and it cools the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a Himalayan shamanic recipe where
they use a mugwort and night blooming
[SPEAKER_00]: jasmine flowers with the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a lot of alchemical blending
of herbs that can really push the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: experience into a more focused kind of
beam.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes sense, I'm trying not to be
too esoteric, but there's a lot of herbs
[SPEAKER_00]: that can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say like bridle, kind of like you
would put a saddle on a horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to ride it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows you to go someplace longer
without fatigue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's a unique thing and I
don't think people have so got into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of artisanal hash making and
a lot of really new things, but you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: see too many blending philosophies except
maybe in pens where people are putting in
[SPEAKER_00]: fake terpenes and such, but it's all
alchemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really alchemical in its nature,
but I kind of just like it straight up as
[SPEAKER_00]: buds in my pipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any kind of additives that are
commonly available that you might
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend people could give a try if
they're interested?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to remember what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the name of that one herb?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one herb that's really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's actually an Australian herb
and good as a powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of not a cactus and not
a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like succulent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, canna.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take canna powder and put it on
cannabis and it will erase the feelings of
[SPEAKER_00]: like paranoia and people that get edgy on
cannabis and they just can't handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll really take the edge off.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, they use vacha, which is
calamus, and that bridles the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: cools it for smoking and it also keeps it
from getting too out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of keeps it kind of focused and
what else?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of shamanic recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the one and I haven't really I
tried to make my own version of the night
[SPEAKER_00]: blooming jasmine mugwort and hash,
but I couldn't get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's gonna be in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try that one again, but you know,
there's a lot of native American herbs
[SPEAKER_00]: that are really good, like that'll help
out lobelia and maline, lots of things to
[SPEAKER_00]: cool the smoke and nourish the lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a whole realm that people
really need to explore because there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: much to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, without doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you find that you're able to
treat a lot of the things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: bothering you with this more kind of
natural approach or do you still use some
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of Western medicine, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use like a Western allopathic medicine
as an emergency medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it has it really treats the
problem and not the root cause of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't I really enjoy a lot of the
ancestral herbalism and like traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, any kind of
thing that's working with meridians,
[SPEAKER_00]: energy plants, minerals, things that are
really taking the body as a whole and also
[SPEAKER_00]: taking into consideration things like
mental states, even environments,
[SPEAKER_00]: geography.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everything plays into healing,
but I think cannabis is our primary
[SPEAKER_00]: healing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the dog version of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the thing that is right there
for us on every level from medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational, spiritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It covers all the bases.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so with that being said, the first
strain you ever bred was that trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: create something medical, something that's
going to help you to better tap into these
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of streams of consciousness if you
want to give it that term or was it more
[SPEAKER_02]: of a happy accident, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first time it kind of really
it was a happy accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I got some seeds from Mark Emory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went up and got some seeds one time a
long time ago up in Canada, and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember which one it was, but
hermaphrodited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a feminized one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got seeds and I was like,
oh, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know, and I kind of
played around and grew those out and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, this is really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's because before that I was
really into DJing and making music and
[SPEAKER_00]: blending things on that level and
aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, wow, I can take different,
totally unique and different plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: bring them together to make some in this
kind of union or love to make brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was the most ultimate
beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that kind of started my seed
addiction and it just went from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who were the first breeders you were
buying when you developed your seed
[SPEAKER_02]: addiction?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, the reason I ask that is
because I'm sure a lot of people listening
[SPEAKER_02]: who buy your seeds would probably
themselves consider that they have a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: addiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always interesting to know,
you know, who was the breeders breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to kind of pour over those old
catalogs, you know, and I always looked
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would like go over them and like
finding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get my little magic marker and circle
all the ones I get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, I didn't I didn't
have a lot of money so I can only get one
[SPEAKER_00]: or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would kind of go looking at
descriptions and kind of look for ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of I felt jived with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was some of the flying old flying
Dutchmen like the Fumakon Dio and DJ
[SPEAKER_00]: shorts ones always intrigued me because
especially the after he was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a real bell ringer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, cool bell ringer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything kind of weird and unique and
special, I always look for kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always look kind of for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy like the really fringe cannabis,
like the really unique, odd, weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe doesn't look that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe doesn't grow that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a unique effects and even its
own unique kind of spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so I mean, the first question that
comes to mind with that is, is you
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned you had the seed bank catalogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I I know that you've actually got quite an
impressive collection of seed bank
[SPEAKER_02]: catalogs from years gone by.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that like an intentional hobby or did
it just kind of work out that you happen
[SPEAKER_02]: to accumulate them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've always been like a treasure
hunter and treasure gatherer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anything that I'm passionate about,
I really love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I collect records,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I used to always in books,
like books were my first passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, I went to records and
then when I wanted seeds, I started
[SPEAKER_00]: selling my books and records to get seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's kind of morphs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I also like crystals,
but not so much anymore because I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: feel bad for the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't you know, I just love to
gather and collect things that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the all those catalogs are so
unique and so fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, it brings me a lot of
joy so I can just geek out, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd be the perfect person to ask this
question to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've long since held the view that that
photo of Neville in the hash den holding
[SPEAKER_02]: the bricks of hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that's the most iconic
photo in cannabis culture, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you've probably got a far better
having seen, you know, more magazines than
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you agree with that or is there another
photo which kind of stands out a bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love all those photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I especially, you know, I always love the
sadhus, like smoking the chillum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those always got me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always looked so like regal and like
divine and divine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just the plumes of smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I totally agree with that picture of
Neville.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crazy thing is through
synchronicity, I met the guy who took that
[SPEAKER_00]: picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Was he an Afghan guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, Neville, this is like this is a
story in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville took along a photographer when he
went on and kind of like a sidekick,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a Batman-Robin situation on his
famous trip that went through Pakistan or
[SPEAKER_00]: India and Nepal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his name is Steve and Steve took that
picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I kind of got that first
85 seed bank catalog from him because he
[SPEAKER_00]: still had a bunch left and he would tell
me some wild stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, he actually took that picture
and actually all the pictures in that
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as a bit of an Australian pride
question, where do you sit, Neville,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the hierarchy of breed astrate history,
so to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing some of the deeper human stories
of him, I mean, I try not to put anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: on a pedestal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He definitely was a primordial archetype
for gathering and dispensing and creating
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't know, kind of like he was
almost like a seed of none of it himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he kind of bloomed in the Dutch scene
and really threw passion and drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: He collected seeds from America,
from all over, from Southeast Asia,
[SPEAKER_00]: Central Asia and really kind of jump
started that whole movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, along with Sensei and some of the
older guys, I mean, I mean, you can say
[SPEAKER_00]: good about him, you can say bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was an amazing guy and I would
love to see him kind of come back out and
[SPEAKER_00]: and really shine again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, I really believe in
respecting and nourishing our elders and
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that come before us,
because there's a lot of knowledge and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of information and there's
just a lot of, I don't know, good mojo in
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think Neville's a pretty cool
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, maybe as a bit of a
two-parter, I've heard some rumors that he
[SPEAKER_02]: is considering maybe doing more things
within the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: If he were to come back, would he be the
type of person who you'd want to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as a follow-up, which breeders
would you want to work with in like a
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborative sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, are there any who you really
kind of dig what they're doing and you
[SPEAKER_02]: think together you could do some cool
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, you know, I kind of thought about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of work here and there with friends
or do stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: For commercially, I don't really work
with, I never really thought of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I thought of was kind of
like I had a secret seed company that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was starting called Synergy and it was
going to be working with all the breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: that I kind of respected as one-offs and
all the money would go to charity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like how, you know,
the collabs with glass, they come up with
[SPEAKER_00]: these one collabs of glass and it's like
two famous glass artists and they make
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing and that's it and it's this
beautiful piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought if we could, if I could like
find some of the breeders that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: respect and we can share pollen or share
plants and create maybe like two strains
[SPEAKER_00]: each and each person gets to choose the
charity, I thought that would be a really
[SPEAKER_00]: unique way to work with people and make it
for a good cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for people I'd want to work with,
you know, I don't know because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to like say people and then not say
enough people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to leave people out but anyone that
has a niche and is passionate about their
[SPEAKER_00]: work and really, you know, so I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many, so many people and so
many people I respect and it's like I
[SPEAKER_00]: almost don't want to start naming off
names because I don't want to leave
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say anyone that's passionate
has their skill set down, has the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: they work down and has a niche,
like has an avenue that they like to
[SPEAKER_00]: explore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be more than honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just I can barely keep up with things
here on my own since it's just me and my
[SPEAKER_00]: wife.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have time to even brush my hair or
brush my teeth, tie my shoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I swear every day just zips by and I get
to come out at the Emerald Cup but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean maybe later in the interview I'll
come up with some names in different
[SPEAKER_00]: contexts but I don't really name off names
because I don't want to leave anybody out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to hurt any feelings but if
there's a lot of amazing breeders and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of passionate breeders with
good hearts and those are the people I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a question we've got from a lot of
people was are you able to kind of explain
[SPEAKER_02]: the differences between your seed
companies?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are aware there's a few of
them now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something I personally was interested in
is what is the distinction, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: is do you look at a project and you think,
oh, this is a supernatural selections
[SPEAKER_02]: project or, you know, is there kind of
rules and then that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: dictates what each project falls into or
is it a bit more loose than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like an artist that has a
couple bands, you know, and they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: free to do whatever they want within the
context of these bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get tibes, you know,
like you're going to do this and this
[SPEAKER_00]: band, you're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say so Bodyseeds is kind of the
original and that's kind of like I can do
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all about doing whatever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can mash up hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do elite crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can weave things in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like just really freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also the one that pays the bills
and it's the one where I kind of have to
[SPEAKER_00]: cater to the flavor of the weeks and kind
of add my own twist to some of the modern
[SPEAKER_00]: elite hybrids or make unique cool things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just kind of like it's just the
basic creative model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Nureka is kind of that's more the
preservation angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's would be like working with
heirloom and land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes mostly those may be vintage,
but not so much, but mostly just heirloom
[SPEAKER_00]: land race preservation and that kind of
anything I collect when I travel,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything I get from other people with good
graces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also all that money that is generated
from Nureka goes to scholarships and to
[SPEAKER_00]: funds to keep on going and keep on
collecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of just a preservation seed
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's a couple releases
each year and what I think is kind of fun
[SPEAKER_00]: or fun to work out and what I think people
would enjoy working with or just having
[SPEAKER_00]: their bank or their collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Supernatural Selections is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like, that's really
what I'm really excited about,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's it's going back to the roots
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all it's no modern hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's using no modern lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all land race, vintage or
heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I get in there all F1 hybrids using
these old things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to go back and I can create so
many unique things because I'm not stuck
[SPEAKER_00]: in that kind of the stagnant hyper bold
gene pool that we have right now where
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's kind of mashed up kind of
like Baskin Robbins 31 flavors style,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much unique stuff to pop out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this really gives me a chance to kind
of blaze my own trail and go back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: countries that I've always loved and the
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, because all these seed
lines, especially the vintage and the land
[SPEAKER_00]: race, they all have their own special
spirit and soul and effect and flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by combining these, it's like it's
pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kick a Congolese and like a Kashmiri.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so you're taking these beautiful
Himalayan plants and you're merging them
[SPEAKER_00]: with these, you know, deep humid tropical
jungle strains and you're getting these
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, you can really go all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's I don't know,
just for me, it feels like instead of kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like DJing, it feels like producing
music or it's I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so that's I hope I'm not rambling
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final one was synergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And synergy is just me wanting to have fun
connecting with people in a way to also
[SPEAKER_00]: give back to the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm so busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to kind of get that
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have, you know, I have a few people
I've been talking to and and I think it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: happen eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just just so so busy doing my own
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of wish, you know, it's almost I
kind of want to scale down and be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy life a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'm just never ending grinding
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's I mean, that's my service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my way that I can kind of nourish the
community is by creating and by doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it feels good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever consider kind of expanding the
Team Bodhi, so to speak, such that maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: you did have more freedom to, you know,
for example, go pursue land, raise seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: or things like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you is part of it being a small
kind of mom and pop business part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: central theme of it all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm like a control freak,
but I really like to make sure that my
[SPEAKER_00]: hands are in every single process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's how we keep I don't
know if that's how we keep the prices
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it allows me to stay connected to
whatever I produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I would love at some point,
maybe when the laws are more solidified
[SPEAKER_00]: and things change, it would be nice if
some someone could take care of my mom
[SPEAKER_00]: room and keep it a lot healthier than I
can or so I can travel and I can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of a lot of my friends
are getting into breeding and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing amazing jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to kind of brand branch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, at this point, I'm just I'm kind
of so in my flow that I almost don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of move out in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more to see what the future is
going to bring.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it brings us, you know, this brave new
world of cannabis, I would love to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: free it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would even love to do like an Anthony
Bourdain travel cannabis show kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: Strain Hunters, but Cheech and Chong meets
kind of Austin Powers style.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so that's actually one of the
questions I had was would you ever
[SPEAKER_02]: consider documenting your land race
adventures?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I mean, the viewership is there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I'm sure everyone would
argue that you could do a better job than
[SPEAKER_02]: what Strain Hunters did in almost every
respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the funny thing is if on Breed
Bay, and I think I see Megan, if you dig
[SPEAKER_00]: there are I used to when I had more time,
I used to do these big elaborate kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: travel logs with all the pictures and I
write about all the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're out there if you search for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's like five or six mostly on
Breed Bay, but they're on some other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many countries that I kind of
flail and I haven't done yet, but I just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have time to like at the end of the
day, I'm going to burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to just want to listen to
music or smoke and just meditate or think
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, it's writing is hard and I
love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I would love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to go out and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think I would be as daring
as going into the Congo and places like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but I would definitely like to go to
places like, you know, I would go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ewok village if I could, if I had a
spaceship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're smoking something ordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to go to the places where
people are, you know, kind of the same
[SPEAKER_00]: place as I've been, like mountain people,
people that have that deep connection with
[SPEAKER_00]: nature and to the heart and do more shows
of kind of, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this one guy that this show called
Going Tribal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what it's called,
but it is the most unique show because he
[SPEAKER_00]: was an anthropologist and they would send
him to all these really cool tribes out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would just show him connecting
with them and like laughing and caring and
[SPEAKER_00]: sharing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I would throw in the cannabis
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before you get too down the rabbit hole
of land race hunting, because got a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of questions on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to bring it back to a kind
of an idea you mentioned earlier in that
[SPEAKER_02]: in regards to supernatural selections,
do you feel that doing these kind of raw
[SPEAKER_02]: F1 land race hybrids is going to
potentially lead to the next skunk or the
[SPEAKER_02]: next Northern Lights?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that could potentially be what kind of
injects that invigorated energy into the
[SPEAKER_02]: community?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think maybe it won't pan out
like that because that was more a
[SPEAKER_02]: consequence of the time, you know,
the lack of genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was maybe why those strains got
so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those kind of particular strains were
really strains that were braided over
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, each year they would add in a
new since it was pre kind of clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow out the plants they found in the bag
seed from Mexico, Thailand, Colombia,
[SPEAKER_00]: pick your favorites, keep the seeds next
year, braided into the next favorite one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were these elaborate kind of
breeding programs through time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those produce some of those
really amazing ones like skunks and haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my goal with supernatural selections
is to really allow people to, I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know, to see the extreme possibilities
that cannabis has to offer to really see
[SPEAKER_00]: where we can take it, where we can go,
and how things combine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the beautiful part about it is
you can F2 that thing and it opens up an
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing treasure chest of those two lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those lines are vintage lines,
they're like little time machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes you back to those simpler
times when that plant and even its
[SPEAKER_00]: geography, all the information held in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, I always say that,
I don't know, I know I'm drawing planks,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think it's just my way of getting to
like my kind of graduating, getting to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next level of being even more creative at
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a gift to myself of
saying, okay, you've got to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: point where you have a basic understanding
of cannabis and plants and breeding or any
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this is something that you can
embark on now that's even more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge, but offers so much more
treasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that brings up this kind of idea,
which is quite prevalent at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea of how should I say the concept
of getting permission to breed with other
[SPEAKER_02]: people's genetics or just in general,
breeding with other people's genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are having kind of the
debate, is buying someone's seeds enough
[SPEAKER_02]: for you to then breed with them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it's kind of good practice
to first ask the breeder if it's all right
[SPEAKER_02]: to do so first?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you sit on this issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I understand it coming from all
different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel really honored when people breed
with my stuff and I don't have an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand people put a lot of time and
work into some of their line working and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and they want to keep it
proprietary.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I think really the basis of it is
communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're going to breed with
someone else's work, what an amazing time
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to connect with that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send them an email and go, hey,
I really enjoy this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to breed with it and make
that connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's a friendship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with just the basic respect and
communication it opens up like a whole new
[SPEAKER_00]: world and I think it can really heal the
whole cannabis breeding community because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much bickering and fighting and
weird, everybody doing kooky stuff that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think if people just communicate it and
even if someone says no, you don't have,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's really up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still make the cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it'll be kind of taboo, but I think
most people are human and you ask them and
[SPEAKER_00]: you explain what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it should be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think it's cool to F2
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People's work and then sell it unless you
ask them or if it's a deadline,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it's no longer being produced or the
breeders no longer around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really I think it's an opportunity for
communication that we don't really have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting that you mentioned the
idea and I feel it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a sentiment within the community
right now that the level of camaraderie
[SPEAKER_02]: and friendship is kind of declining
compared to in previous generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you kind of agree with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And more so, how do you think we deal with
that if that is the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely see that as kind of influx.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people that are being
attracted to this because it is such a
[SPEAKER_00]: magnificent thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to weigh in on.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I think a lot of problems now with
social media, I think before in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: times, there was a lot less people,
so there was a lot more communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more camaraderie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't as commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: People weren't producing seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't so many elite clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The forums were about information and
people connecting and they went over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like Instagram is an amazing
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's visceral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for ADD people, but it doesn't
really foster community because it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: basically for promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems you post up a picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get to write a couple things and
then it's on to the next thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a thread in a forum where
people over the years are adding to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so quick and so glossy and
in-your-face and neon that there's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to really make that enduring in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it causes a lot of problems
because people can be very short,
[SPEAKER_00]: very quick, very disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it really doesn't bring out... I
mean, sure, there are people that do
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing things on it, but it doesn't seem
to be the best angle for fostering a
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that the best way for maybe a
newly emerging breeder or someone with
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe not quite as big of a reputation as
they deserve, do you think the best way
[SPEAKER_02]: for them to get known is to not kind of
partake in that marketing game,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak, that you mentioned,
but kind of let their work speak for
[SPEAKER_02]: itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you feel that maybe we're in an age
where you almost can't be off Instagram?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you need that marketing
aspect, otherwise you're just never going
[SPEAKER_02]: to take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for new breeders, I think
Instagram is pretty crucial in a way
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's kind of like the roster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you sign up like, hey,
this is me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for new breeders, you know what I
say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make a good cross and give away a
bazillion seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give away seeds and make friends and
communicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your seeds speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Word of mouth is the ultimate thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I never advertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never promote myself because I believe
that I'm promoting myself through my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people like the work, they're going to
tell their friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to do more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just if you're into it,
do it for the plant's sake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it for your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make an awesome hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give out all the seeds and see where that
takes you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like some great advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we go back to kind of the breeding side
of things, when you're thinking about
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a new project, maybe a line or just
a certain cross, do you approach it in a
[SPEAKER_02]: very conceptualized manner?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you think I want to pair this
male with this female and I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: will work out quite well?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is it more so just a general process
where you're thinking, oh, let's see what
[SPEAKER_02]: happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like this could be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for me, I kind of, I have a lot of
different approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll breed like emotionally
where I just kind of feel like this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and this plant need to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just kind of feel like they have
similarities and dissimilarities that
[SPEAKER_00]: would work perfect together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like you're the matchmaker or
it's like the dating game or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you know your plants and
you've been around them and you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice mom room, the plants have their own
interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of say, hey, this plant kind
of seems like it kind of likes this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and bring them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's always fun to put twists on some
of the new elite hybrids or add some
[SPEAKER_00]: special things to the chem line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, to additive and
subtractive, you know, goals are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a goal, like you want to make
some plant that has a specific terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: signature, you can really, you know,
you can point all your goal oriented leads
[SPEAKER_00]: to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all kind of like, for me,
I try and kind of just keep myself open to
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme possibilities and just kind of
feel out what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for breeding, if I'm, you know,
for my commercial breeding where I'm kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of generating enough money to keep my
family and us fed is I usually develop
[SPEAKER_00]: males, you know, special males,
and then I will pollinate basically my
[SPEAKER_00]: whole harem and then slowly test those
over time and see where those go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And continually each year, you know,
finding more unique males and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing how they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll use like a target female that I
know how she expresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I took a new male, it's usually to
her first so that I can see kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: she does with this new male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I, you know, for me, I guess for
basically for body seats, it's all about
[SPEAKER_00]: developing special males and then using
them on kind of my own special plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the flavors of the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, that's kind of the gist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's different breeding styles
where you get into that of tricks and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, but really it's just kind of
following your bliss, being passionate
[SPEAKER_00]: about it and you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you decide you wanted to take a
certain strain to the next generation or
[SPEAKER_02]: you wanted to, you know, look for a
special male to work with, how many seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: do you ideally like to pop to kind of get
a good representation of the strain to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, be able to see what's locked
within it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for my seeds, I usually just pop one
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I don't find something in a pack,
then I call it a bummer thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you should be able to find an
excellent plant in every pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what most of you should be aiming
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you should be having to get
multiple packs or search.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, these days it's not hard to
make a good hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our gene pool has been so refined over
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not like going back to the
70s and 80s where you're bringing these
[SPEAKER_00]: land races together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we have a highly refined gene
pool and it's almost impossible to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: bad cross with some of the stuff we have
today unless, you know, except,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, maybe hermaphroditic tendencies
and stuff that kind of have been slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: creeping in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not rocket sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're passionate, it's pretty easy
just to put things together and get good
[SPEAKER_00]: things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have a vision, you're really
going to want to do some goal orientated
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding where you're really kind of
focusing on an outcome and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything you can to fulfill that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you find that's the case with
most of your projects?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think the analogy that jumps to
mind is I think Subcool said that in his
[SPEAKER_02]: mind when he's breeding to create a
certain flavor, it's kind of like cooking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're kind of thinking what two
flavors would add together to make that
[SPEAKER_02]: strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that kind of similar to how you think
when you're thinking about those crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I'm breeding specifically for
terpenes and flavor, usually that'll be my
[SPEAKER_00]: primary thing is I'll find two plants in
the field, you know, that I know have
[SPEAKER_00]: either complimentary or similar smells
that I think could either bolster them or
[SPEAKER_00]: increase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, for aroma based breeding,
it's probably one of the besides color
[SPEAKER_00]: based breeding, it's probably the easiest
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can basically take your
males, flower them super long until they
[SPEAKER_00]: put out visible resin and you can smell
the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you basically can choose which
one is the one that smells closest to what
[SPEAKER_00]: you want with the best structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't wait, you can use
ephelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff called, there's a name for it,
but basically it turns your males to
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can, you know, smell it a lot
quicker, but I don't really think that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: great way because then you can't find
resinous males.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really into resinous males.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people aren't, but I think
resinous males for me is really what I
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of aim for, what I'm looking for,
aroma based breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think is the most well-known
Bodhi strain, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_02]: What strain embodies Bodhi seeds the best
in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the two ones that people always
say my like flagships are Goji Oji and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunshine Daydream, kind of using those two
males that I use a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're now kind of retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those I guess would be my current legacy
in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to mention those two,
but I thought if I suggested them,
[SPEAKER_02]: it might bait you into picking them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Tranquil Elephantiser is a line
that's always been of interest to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've personally played around
breeding with it myself, but the aspect
[SPEAKER_02]: which I find most interesting about it is
how many times it's been, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: remixed and reworked.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it about that cross which made
you go back to it so many times?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just kind of like a fun and
fascinating thing to kind of play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I'm really in with,
I'm really into music and I'm really into
[SPEAKER_00]: like dub and the remix and taking things
and, you know, moving them back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love flipping parents and it just
seemed, it was a unique line and it had
[SPEAKER_00]: some really fun things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so each time I would kind of tinker
with the parent lines, I'd be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, so I'm, you know, moving forward a
generation or backwards or using
[SPEAKER_00]: male-female reversals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, let's see what this does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is like another kind of
facet of the Tranquil Elephantiser.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it was just having fun and kind
of exploring, bouncing back and forth and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and even, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was mostly just for the
experience of just exploring that way of
[SPEAKER_00]: working with the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You did it with the mother's milk as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you find the results were as good or,
and you know, as a result of that,
[SPEAKER_02]: is it something you would consider doing
again in the future or is it more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: case by case basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can't make those anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can line breed them,
but I retired both of those males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, in the future, I love,
you know, I might, I'm thinking about kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of doing fun things with the goji now that
it, you know, that it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe line breeding it or taking my
favorite phenos and kind of playing off
[SPEAKER_00]: those or even, you know, making remixes in
a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I'm always trying to move
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to stay static.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to be stuck in lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to kind of always be exploring and
moving forward and kind of following my
[SPEAKER_00]: passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I get stuck in these like,
you know, static lines, it's like in the
[SPEAKER_00]: UK, they always get mad because they say,
oh, you never restock your old lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always creating new ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, I don't want to just
be creating those same old lines over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it also gives people the
ability, you know, goji's no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goji's not going to go longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people can F2 those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can play with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do their own twist on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, it's beautiful to pass
the torch and allow people to bring their
[SPEAKER_00]: own special artistry to it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think moving forward is a
really good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think remixing and playing around
and moving things back and forth and males
[SPEAKER_00]: and females moving their positions,
I think is a really unique way to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: really see the deeper side of a string.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the ancient OG, that's another one
which has a bit of a cult following.
[SPEAKER_02]: My feeling is probably due to the Iranian
genetics in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen a quote online.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on a forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it might have been from your post.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says something along the lines of
the Iranian might not be an Iranian land
[SPEAKER_02]: race, but just something along those
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: This brings up the idea for me of how do
you know what's real, especially someone
[SPEAKER_02]: in your position who must be offered a lot
of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the time, you're probably
unable to verify it for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe using the Iranian as an example,
you know, like, how do you go about trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to verify or what's your process in that
regard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, these days I try and I think
basically popping your own seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know exactly where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the best way to make sure
something is verified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try and be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be even more better at really
make tracing the pathway of a clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: who I got it from, who they got it from,
and really making sure I know the origin
[SPEAKER_00]: stories and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few times I get myself into trouble,
you know, like I think in the Kim 91,
[SPEAKER_00]: a long, long time ago, there was only one
Kim 91 clone and it was verified by Kim
[SPEAKER_00]: dog and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it came from Joe Brand's kind of camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later it came out that really
wasn't the Kim 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a divergent line or alternate
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the real Kim 91 was the
Skunt VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I got that, I was like,
okay, now I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had the Kim 91 JB and the Kim 91
Skunt VA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're both amazing plants,
but by, you know, talking to people and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and really, you know, I respect a lot of
people who do a lot of the strain research
[SPEAKER_00]: and really listening to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay, yeah, we're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to make a disclaimer and all
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the Iranian, you know,
that was a unique situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a couple of clones from a friend who
had a really unique connection,
[SPEAKER_00]: offline connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an old Persian man and he had some
really cool old kind of like LA stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he had the LA Pyrka, she had the LA
Street Ghani, which it was like a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that was back before the OG that was
pretty popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else he had?
[SPEAKER_00]: He had that Iranian and then something
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he had so many unique and rare
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of bought into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this, maybe this is the progenitor
of maybe, you know, Persian strains could
[SPEAKER_00]: be the OG Krish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this is real.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have a lot of similarities,
but you know, I don't know if it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: miss mark or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost think it could have been like a,
maybe like one of the more primordial OGs,
[SPEAKER_00]: just the way it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so close to an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit more wild,
but it sure does make good crosses and it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes great outdoor crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could almost see it having the vigor
and the kind of stability of a land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, that's a tricky one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of adds to the mystique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of like that people are really
loving that line because it does so well
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like that people are doing
F2s and are really kind of, they're kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of taking the ball and running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I may try and F2 it or F3 and kind of
explore too, but I'm just stoked to watch
[SPEAKER_00]: other people do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a cool line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's, that's one of my
anomalies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a few, but that's definitely
one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all I can really say about it is it's
groups and it's amazing line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I can't verify that particular
one because I went no longer in contact
[SPEAKER_00]: with that person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That raises an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think are the origins of the
OG?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've heard a lot of people,
I personally have heard a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: say that it's TK and then possibly cross
to a lemon tie or possibly just S1s,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, and then the OGs,
so to speak, went from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your opinion on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different people saying
that, you know, I've heard everything from
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an old Kauai strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, or there's, you know, Kalu a kid
or it's his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was saying, you know, it was an old
world Pakistani lemon tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the, the, whatever it is,
the super knot, guy in Florida and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, all these people tracing it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's all great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's chasing it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I don't really even care where
it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know what it's made of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know, go back before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is its actual genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it some old Dutch stock that somebody
found or old super sativa club,
[SPEAKER_00]: or was it a combination of something
special like a Pakistani Mexican or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: even a Thai Mexican or some kind of,
or, you know, a lot of more central Asian
[SPEAKER_00]: strains when people say, Kush,
you know, the whole Kush moniker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically that kind of spicy powdery
coffee baby powder kind of smell that
[SPEAKER_00]: people associate with a lot of the
California and LA strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never experienced a plant from the
Hindu Kush region that smells anything and
[SPEAKER_00]: looks anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it looks like it, but never smelled
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, where those plants that
smell like that come from is Iran,
[SPEAKER_00]: Iraq, all of central Asia has those very
perfumey spicy with those same kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that it must have been a
central Asian and then some kind of very
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene-rich lemony, lemon limon,
maybe a Mexican, old Mexican, maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: Thai, but you know, that could play into
why it's very hermaphroditic in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think anybody will ever
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see the, I remember that
Adam Dunshaw, where they were doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole genome testing, and I'd love to see
phylos maybe go deeper and see kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: where, you know, through genetics,
where it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a unique strain and it's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so beautiful, but no one seems to
know the exact origins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In regards to that JB Chem 91,
you answered about three of my questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to try to amalgamate what's
left of them into one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in regards to the JB Chem 91,
what about it makes it worth breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you do still breed with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just label it, you know, the JB Chem
91.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, like what's different
because in my mind, I thought,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, is it different enough such that
it's worth breeding with, or is it kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: just like a bit of an imitation that's not
quite as good as the original?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the Skunk VA is kind of
almost OG-ish and it's kind of like a dark
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani OG, like it rich and oily and
spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Chem 91 JB is this really
unique, it has a really unique look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that really kind of old school
kind of almost like hash planning nodules,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it has a very kind of like decilly and
then kind of earthy and almost skunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more kind of decilly,
earthy, skunky than the Skunk VA,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of that more dark,
deep OG thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely think it has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of has like, it reminds me of kind
of like when people, when I was in high
[SPEAKER_00]: school, when people come up like with a
super dank bud, you know, the Skunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of reminds me of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just knobby and I think it's a great
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sometimes it's not the most stable
in crosses, but I think it has its place
[SPEAKER_00]: and who knows what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be unique to get Joe Brand to kind of
talk about some of these kind of cuts that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of slipped out of his arsenal and
what they really were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one seems to really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's all kinds of, you know,
there's still a lot of Chem 91s out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like the big worm and there's a
lot of different ones and who knows really
[SPEAKER_00]: where and what these are coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're just S1s or if they're
hybrid, or maybe they, yeah, it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole strain, strain, inspector strain
thing is pretty amazing when you get into
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the chem personally has got a lot
of mystery surrounding, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: I love following the history on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that whole process like of you
discovering that it wasn't the real Chem
[SPEAKER_02]: 91?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how did that happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did someone come to you and say,
this is the real Chem 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was just kind of obvious or
was it more of like a discovery thing
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself or how did that happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that go down?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a combination of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, a few people that really
communicating with a few people that I
[SPEAKER_00]: really respect their knowledge about
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think one of my favorite people to
ask about, about California and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Oregon West coast strains would
be like inspector.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he has one of the most vast and
underrated like strain mines on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he is, he's like a strain computer
and he was, you know, we were friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he showed me some of his pictures and
he told me about his experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even at one point we traded and I got
the cut and I grew him side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I saw, what was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was going to be his name?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a big dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when he would remember when he
first came online on ICMAG, good dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He posted his pictures and I'm like,
it looks similar, but it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, really growing them
side by side and then seeing, and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the whole thing was funny as it
threw me off as, you know, it did
[SPEAKER_00]: everything in our power.
[SPEAKER_00]: To verify it, you know, someone even got a
nug to Kim dog himself and he verified it
[SPEAKER_00]: as the Kim 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, oh, that's probably as good
as I can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of love eating crow,
like going back on my words.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, I think it,
it's good to kind of come before the
[SPEAKER_00]: community and go, Hey, I messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows people that they can do that
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know the Kim line has so
many unique, like it's almost like this
[SPEAKER_00]: planet shooting all these like satellites
of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they're all cool plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my EP buddy, he wanted to know,
do you still have the chem one or the chem
[SPEAKER_02]: two by any chance?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the one seems like it's a little,
it's a little dotted with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to bring it back, but that,
yeah, that's an amazing plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that many people have
experienced it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it's kind of a, it would be like
the sativa of the bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes a couple of weeks longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a more kind of a cerebral kind of,
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as, you know, kind of like Kim
dog is very like a, it kind of muffles
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like putting on one of those
inflatable samurai suits.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go out to our Halloween party,
it kind of like, you know, it takes you
[SPEAKER_00]: down and it kind of, it's like a big bear
hug in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's very heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the chem one, it has that same
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the chem smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit different, but it
definitely has more of a sativa hit and a
[SPEAKER_00]: really kind of sativa hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, cause it has that still warm hug,
but it has, it's, it's got kind of that
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy, heavy indica thing where your mind
just goes off into amazing realms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, I don't think it's commercially
viable so much and it does take a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a really unique kind of lens on
the whole chem family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you find that you prefer more
indica or more sativa strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, or are you kind of up for
anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I just remember I was reading an
article in skunk magazine and I believe
[SPEAKER_02]: you wrote it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was basically saying that the white
snow lotus, my mistake, the snow lotus was
[SPEAKER_02]: some of your favorite personal smoke and
it veered a bit towards the sativa side
[SPEAKER_02]: from memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is that kind of how you find
things in general or was that just the
[SPEAKER_02]: snow lotus?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I always have liked sativas a
lot cause I like psychedelics and I like
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of that meditative opening up space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like, I think sativas have a
really unique spirit to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they all kind of have their own
unique personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are very pushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are, you know, some are a roller
coaster ride.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are super creepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, I mean, I'm sure in indicas too,
but they, they have these unique
[SPEAKER_00]: properties and each one kind of opens up
like kind of like a little higher center
[SPEAKER_00]: in your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that, but you know,
now as I'm maturing and I'm getting older,
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of, I've been really enjoying like
heady indicas like, or I should be saying
[SPEAKER_00]: broadleafs, but really unique,
maybe heirloom or land race broadleafs
[SPEAKER_00]: that are deeply relaxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the body and healing, but at the same
time, like opens your mind in almost like
[SPEAKER_00]: a dreamlike state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really loving kind of like heady
indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like extreme possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always looked for plants,
you know, that just body, like absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: no mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I gotta find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how nice would that be just to go out
dancing or to like, so you don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: trip out if you're going to meet people
are more social.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also like completely mind,
like absolutely no body, like some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Indian lines that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or almost nobody at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I even have some ones that you smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a Vietnamese one you smoke and you
don't really know if you're high or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is just kind of slightly weird
and everything's a little brighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just kind of, it just feels like
you're on another planet, but you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really feel high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're almost like, did I get stoned or
what, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it puts you in a completely different
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if that's an interaction
of multiple cannabinoids or just this way
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes interact or, you know,
it's such a, we're still kind of in,
[SPEAKER_00]: the early stages of really figuring out
why cannabis does what it does to our
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that there's a market now for
weed, which maybe doesn't get you just,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, completely stoned, so to speak,
but more what you said maybe makes things
[SPEAKER_02]: feel a bit different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the example I often hear is people
say, Oh, I breed for Terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me that is kind of saying you're
doing what I said, you know, you're,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's maybe not as potent, but maybe got an
overall different effect, maybe more,
[SPEAKER_02]: or up someone's alley who's up for a more
sedative type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that's a market worth looking
into?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think maybe it's just someone
trying to make up for poor potency within
[SPEAKER_02]: their crosses?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think as the emerging kind of
recreational market sweeps over Canada and
[SPEAKER_00]: America, and now we have medical in Mexico
and all these places are tuning in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for people that aren't smokers
that have never done cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of nice to have training
wheels to have something that's tasty and
[SPEAKER_00]: visceral and great to the senses that is
very low THC that can kind of ease you in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to keep going, you know,
if you're a grandma, you want to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: something or, you know, people don't want
to get too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know now there's branded things like
sex pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that pot that's supposed to make
you feel sensual and horny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's also then the CBD
style stuff where the CBD THC things,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are kind of more, you know,
those are a different feeling in
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be a lot more freeing up of
the body than so much the mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's, I really think there's a
market for any expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just finding that niche and going
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also finding the place that
you're going to be able to then that or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's, it's almost like you have
to have a passion for that specific thing
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going for else you're never going
to prevail.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the more interesting things I
remember talking to about it, the Emerald
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup was how you said you only really smoke
once a day or so, and it's more of like a
[SPEAKER_02]: meditative slash ritual type thing,
as opposed to just a recreational one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you mind going a little more into
detail about that and kind of how you do
[SPEAKER_02]: it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you combining, say, meditation with
smoking, or is it more just smoking and
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to undergo it as a type of
meditation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really, when I say kind of
meditation, more it's just like me time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually smoke when everyone's asleep
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three kids and I'm hyper sensitive
to cannabis and all kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't need to, I like to take bong
hits and if I take a bong hit during the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, it's like I'm just going to be
staring at plants and not be able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: working and not being really able to
interact with my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like after I'm done with
everything, I have all these plants that I
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have hundreds of different
strains hanging and I'll be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, what are we going to try tonight?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll, you know, usually it's sativa's
and usually keeps me up all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, smoking once a day allows me
to not only not bludgeon my
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system, but keep me like
sensitive enough that I can really
[SPEAKER_00]: perceive the individual differences in
plants, especially if I'm going through
[SPEAKER_00]: new lines or different phenols.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really allows me to stay crisp and
honorable to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everyone has their own special
relationship to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't get a judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people that need to smoke it a
hundred times a day is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't need to smoke it once a year,
that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really how we interact with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I hear some people get
kind of like fooled on or making fun of
[SPEAKER_00]: that they don't smoke that much or they're
lightweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think lightweight should be celebrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think being sensitive to the plant and
knowing how to be respectful to the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and to engage it in a way that,
that, you know, it's a special meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that more people should do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think sometimes when you smoke way too
much, you don't really get to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't experience the nuances.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I understand for medical
reasons, people do need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even for self-medicating and other
things, I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think to keep yourself really
sensitive and clean to, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: breathing and really diving deep into
different strengths, I think it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: good to create a special time that you
interact with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, it's just, it's late at night
and sometimes I'll meditate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll listen to music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, you know, do this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I do yoga in the day or ride a mountain
bike, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, it's not like I only do it at
night, but I usually try and just smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: once a day and that's what basically works
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless I'm trekking, then I'm going to
smoke all day long as I trek because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So given, you know, your relatively small
amount of consumption compared to say
[SPEAKER_02]: other breeders, do you find it hard to
personally sample all the plants you grow
[SPEAKER_02]: out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, I mean, my assumption would be that
you must kind of have a group of trusted
[SPEAKER_02]: friends who kind of act as your pallet in
a certain regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you still manage to kind of work
your way through them all?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do my best to work through
all, I only have 365 days a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, when any friends come over,
I'm always like, hey, you want to try
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, I make bags because I
literally like, my whole garage is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just hundreds of strains and I don't
know what to do with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just, when they get too old,
I'll just throw them over the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it's just, it's a
wonderland, but I'm always like,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, try this, try this, try this,
try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I need, I wish there was some
dedicated like super stoners that would,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could just give like a bag once a week
and be like, hey, try this and write all,
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have people a long time ago that
are like, hey, try all these, write down
[SPEAKER_00]: what you think about each one and give
that kind of bag to a couple of different
[SPEAKER_00]: people so I could get more kind of
insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these days, you know, I'll give a bag
to whoever comes over, but really it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I get one chance each night
and it usually works pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do, in a week, I can do Finos,
pretty much seven Finos from a new line in
[SPEAKER_00]: a week and take all my notes and kind of
know where I'm going from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of percentage of your day do you
spend hacking through uncharted
[SPEAKER_02]: territories, looking for new land races?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's kind of sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel kind of like a dork.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to really be able to get out there
more and I really, like my heart just
[SPEAKER_00]: soars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my spirit is so happy when I'm out in
the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's where I feel at home,
like just, you know, no expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's totally out of your element.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every moment is something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, my spirit just gobbles that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now with three kids and business and
all that, I'm kind of like stuck and it
[SPEAKER_00]: drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now things are starting to pick up
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did a collections trip with a
couple of friends in Guatemala about six
[SPEAKER_00]: months ago and kind of contemplating a
quick one in Oaxaca in about a month or
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some good ideas for a special spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But daytime, it's really, you know,
I do a lot of trading and I do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: seed popping and I just kind of try and
explore what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, maybe a day is I wake up
late because I go to bed late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually do kid stuff, pick up kids,
do this, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe in the afternoon I get to do
some outdoor, then it's time more kid
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dinners, put the kids to bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I go out and I do indoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when everything's done and going,
I'll go down to kind of live in a dome
[SPEAKER_00]: down on the lower part of the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just pick something that from
hanging from the ceiling and take a big
[SPEAKER_00]: bong rip and usually listen to meditate,
listen to music, take notes, read,
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of get in my own space and kind
of like, kind of realign with the force,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's happened to you mostly?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I kind of, I pretty much like
any kind of music except maybe I'm not so
[SPEAKER_00]: into contemporary country Western,
like that doesn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of like the, any of the new
whatever, whatever is on the radio,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not so thrilled about like all the new
poppy stuff, but I primarily listen to
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe like, I guess people would call it
bass music.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of electronic music that's heavy on
the low frequency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like a lot of older stuff like I
love Hendrix and that blend, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: sixties punk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I even, you know, some, some,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mostly I would have to say it would be
classic electronic music and then newer,
[SPEAKER_00]: really psychedelic bass music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like ambient, I like world
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like, I'm pretty open,
but I like Vajons a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Kirtan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like even listen to podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just like listen to my own
ears, but really I think if I had to pick
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing, it would be probably bass
music.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that sounds strange,
but that's me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So although I was kind of, you know,
joking a bit of tongue in cheek with the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole hacking through uncharted
territories, it kind of is a fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate statement in many ways,
at least compared to other breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how does that whole process go down?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I remember when you're on the
Adam Dunn show, you said generally you
[SPEAKER_02]: have a contact organizing when you go into
a different country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you mind filling us in a little more
on the details of, you know, how the
[SPEAKER_02]: average trip goes down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, you know, usually I'll do some
research and I'll pick a place that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: always wanted to go to that also has a
history of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I'll do a lot of looking in
books and I'll do a lot of research online
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll try and find specific places or
specific strains or try and get clues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully I made a friend there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I have a contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the real thing I try
and do, and sometimes it backfires when I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't done it for a while, is
synchronicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to a country, go to the places that you
researched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be the coolest person you can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, be who you really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Open your heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make connections with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually I travel alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently I've been taking friends,
which is really fun, but I used to just
[SPEAKER_00]: travel alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd meet a lot of people and you just
kind of develop relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I swear, synchronicities happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, from point A to point B,
just follow the clues and they'll usually
[SPEAKER_00]: take you to where you need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I usually like, I love to
choose places where I can track,
[SPEAKER_00]: like kind of get up into the mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mountain people are so friendly and
you just have to be really respectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I try and, I never bring in my
own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always bring in like heirloom vegetable
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also bring in like antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to bring in pencils, chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to like really give of myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always bring these fake teeth and
crazy glasses because I like to make
[SPEAKER_00]: people crack up and smile and make the
kids laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the key to, you know, I think anyone
that loves cannabis and anyone that loves
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling, I think it's our birthright and
it's our duty to get out there and save
[SPEAKER_00]: those strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and even, or even if you can't
go and you say you're a big commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: person, you have trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do trimmers go after they trim all
summer?
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to Guatemala.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go talk to your trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go, hey, bring me back some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even better, talk to your dad's old
hippie friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if he's got any, I mean, you got to
follow every single avenue, but I really
[SPEAKER_00]: think people should, if they like to
travel, they like cannabis, get out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and really show the world like how cool we
are and make those lasting connections
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, help people out and let
them help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one way that we can
really make this a better planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kind of touched on the topic
without trying to throw anyone under the
[SPEAKER_02]: bus.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about, you know,
the idea of trading more hybridized seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: for land-raised seeds to, you know,
the farmers in these countries?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that just a personal choice you decide
not to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think as a kind of modern
society, we have an obligation to not do
[SPEAKER_02]: that given these people may not fully
understand the implications of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, cross-pollination?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's a hard one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a really ethnocentric view to
bring in anything that we think is like
[SPEAKER_00]: super awesome and try and replace it with
someone that they already have,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have a history of it,
that their ancestors grew it, that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: part of their collective consciousness,
that it's weaved through their toil and
[SPEAKER_00]: their sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like these plants that have
been grown in these areas, except now
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you know, rapid commercialization
and also even with drug cartels and people
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing in stuff to try and pump out a
lot of stuff for foreign markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like these strains are special.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're timeless.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weave through cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weave through people's lives and it
holds a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's criminal to take in
especially feminized genetics into these
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis hotspots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really short-sighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's not a smart thing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's one thing, you know,
I've opened up a little bit because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: met some really cool cannabis breeders in
other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been, you know, considered
sending stuff and I'm like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're growing way out in some mountain
valley where there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and you're just doing your
thing as a modern cannabis guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: sure, you know, that would be fun to trade
seeds and do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in an area that has like,
you know, the eons old traditions of
[SPEAKER_00]: working with certain strains and certain
areas that have developed over time and
[SPEAKER_00]: are, you know, that are made for those
areas to bring in something else,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just so, it's so wrong and it's so
sad and it really, it sets up for a global
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, we're just, we're going to
basically, we're just going to break
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves right into a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I definitely think we shouldn't be
bringing foreign genetics into cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: hotspots, you know, but there are
exceptions, but that's my feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, I mean,
to each his own though, I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pass judgment, but I really think it's a
bad idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I read a post recently from your buddy
Sonic Seeds and he said that he's working
[SPEAKER_02]: with some Land Race Jamaican seeds he got
from a buddy, but his end kind of analysis
[SPEAKER_02]: of it all was that they weren't in fact
Land Race Jamaican seeds, but more just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of acclimatized watered down super
silver haze hybrids from kind of all the
[SPEAKER_02]: imported genetics of years gone by that
had polluted the pool, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever found a similar thing happen
with any seeds you've brought back only to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of find?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is the kind of follow-up
question is most of the time when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the seeds, it's probably,
you know, you probably don't have a really
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing representation of flower side by
side for it, do you?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you probably have got to kind of wait
till you get back home and grow it out
[SPEAKER_02]: before you really know what's inside
there, or is that not the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends if you're doing,
if you're doing collections or doing bag
[SPEAKER_00]: seed testing and sampling, or if you're
actually seeing the plants and collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds directly from the plants,
I think then you really get to see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of tell whether,
you know, things are modern hybrids or
[SPEAKER_00]: have that, or if you're more in the
tropics, if they're like true equatorials.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's kind of a unique question
because the big our trip to Guatemala was
[SPEAKER_00]: all about trying to reclaim the strain
that I had long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the best strains I've ever
smoked in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in Guatemala, there's a sister lake
to Lake Tahoe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a caldera lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lake that was a volcano that's been
filled with water and it has its own
microclimates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Lake Atiklan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this amazing, beautiful lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the classic thing is, ever since the
80s, I don't know if you know how many
[SPEAKER_00]: dead shows I've ever been to, but you
know, in the 80s and 90s, everybody wore
[SPEAKER_00]: like Guatemalan shirts and Guatemalan
shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like the style and you'd
sell them on straight down the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of those vendors, when tour
wasn't going on, they would go down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: lake and be buying up the clothes and
they'd also bring down their lot seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, they're basically their
dead family seeds and they would grow
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those seeds, I think hybridized and
pollinated some of the local sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were getting these really unique
plants that were kind of like dead lot
[SPEAKER_00]: meets sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they were, you know, breeding
over cycles, over seasons, and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: acclimatizing and becoming heirlooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had these amazing, amazing combos
of basically ancestral sativas and dead
[SPEAKER_00]: lot seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of my goal, was to kind
of go down there and see really if those
[SPEAKER_00]: were still available, because I'd had
sampled it before in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I got down there, I realized
that, you know what, there's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: people bringing in so many genetics from a
lot of trimmers are going down there,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially to San Pedro and setting up
shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of growers down in America
and buying them from seed bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lake is pretty polluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the gene pool is pretty
polluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unique and it's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting to try new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are really stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those deep, older lines from like the
90s and early 2000s even seem to be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe I just didn't get a chance to
look deep enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, there's still that,
there's a plant down there called,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: Manguito.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of like their blue dream down
there, like the Guatemalan version of blue
[SPEAKER_00]: dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, you know, it's grown all over
Guatemala.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like a throwback from like an
earlier time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has some really unique effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't seem to really like it that
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was kind of cool because it
makes you absolutely stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one of the strains where you
just like stare and laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think it was kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we brought that back,
but that's being hybridized with a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some really cool people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of cool Guatemalans.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of new breeding going down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, that finding land races is
difficult there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, there's, you can go to
the jungle, the Petén, where a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is cultivated, but a lot of the
organized cartels are moving in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're pumping stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it's happening everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Mexico, you know, Jamaica is a good,
is a really good way to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Jamaica had so much early Dutch
stuff brought in that it basically is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the island is these Dutch
Jamaican hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they've kind of turned into
heirlooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure, there's rostas that still have
the lamb's breath and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really most of the island is a unique
kind of like Dutch Jamaican hybrid that's
[SPEAKER_00]: turning into heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, in a way that's kind of cool
because you're getting your, I still love
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids and I still love when things come
together for the first time and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: make this unique love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, the world's being
homogenized very quickly, very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think it's going to slow down
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's only going to get faster and
faster and faster until we're all,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically everything is going to look and
smell pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on that idea of land races,
which one kind of interests you the most
[SPEAKER_02]: in terms of moving forward with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: We often hear people talk about very
reminiscently, you know, Thai.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel that maybe Thai hogs the
spotlight a bit and there's another land
[SPEAKER_02]: race that deserves a bit of a mention that
if it did come back into the mainstream
[SPEAKER_02]: conscious, you know, it would really rock
people's world, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, a good Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Thai, it comes down to being
people being able to like grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly and you know, really find a way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think really for maybe I think as
cannabis becomes globally legal and we
[SPEAKER_00]: start to see these like trade deals where
we're actually going to get stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, shipped over from Thailand,
Colombia, all these places we used to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think then maybe because it's,
you know, from my experience, smoking like
[SPEAKER_00]: land races at the point of origin and then
coming home and growing them and smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it's like a completely different
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like one's like a light
version, like because the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: developed, it's, you know, in a specific
environment, terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you know, there's a lot of things
going into cultural heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much information and
epigenetics that we've through these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the places that they've been for
so long that they've really developed
[SPEAKER_00]: their vital essence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I've smoked Oaxaca in
Oaxaca that just blew my mind and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it back here and it was kind of,
and it's, you know, maybe after a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: seasons of getting used to the new
environment and, you know, keep me in a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple sessions of seeds, it can adapt and
bring out some of its qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we're really going to get
rocked by these land races until we can
[SPEAKER_00]: really start importing them from their
points of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, there's people that
really do excel at growing sativas indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: and really finding the niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple friends that do great jobs
and, you know, I think that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: lines that have been acclimatized,
especially older lines, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: back from the energies and stuff that have
been around forever that were a tie that
[SPEAKER_00]: we kind of could acclimatize to our
mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still get those effects,
but really, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and even stuff like Thai,
you know, the Thai gene pool has been
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty polluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only way to really find some
of these Southeast Asians that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: noteworthy is to go deep, kind of like
that Lao Asian strain I brought back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of right on the border of
China and Burma and it was way up,
[SPEAKER_00]: up in kind of the high, high, highland
forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't the lowland kind of like
humid tropical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like a Jurassic Park style thing
and it was pretty untouched and it really
[SPEAKER_00]: had its own unique essence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people that really want to find
unique and rare stuff are going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: really get back up in there or dig into
older stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, I heard Rob Clark,
I think it was Rob Clark say that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the best land races are going to
be found in your, you know, your dad's
[SPEAKER_00]: friend's collection or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think old seeds are kind of these
special treasure chests that hold a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the magic and even though there are still
hot spots that contain amazing genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really about recovering a lot
of the stuff we have here, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: California and all across the states
where, you know, it's been grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, talking to old people,
like connecting, reaching out,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and now's the time to sprout those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, get them out, get them going,
you know, get that germ class out and
[SPEAKER_00]: about because it's only getting older and
I think maybe that's the kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sacred bridge there is getting deep into
the bush and then also getting deep into
[SPEAKER_00]: people's collections.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the oldest seeds you've ever
been able to germinate?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've tried to germinate all kinds
of super old ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get them to pop but they never come
up, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use seed bombs and all kinds of weird
pumping strategies and I have friends that
[SPEAKER_00]: can do pretty good getting really old
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think what's my oldest?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, most likely probably 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of seeds from the 70s that I
can't seem to get to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it would be 80s or, you know,
a lot of times some of these old,
[SPEAKER_00]: old ones are being refreshed every like
nine years or, you know, they came from
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody's dad who had them and then their
uncle made more nine years later and then
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else made, you know, they kind of
they're being refreshed and that's one way
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was a really kind
gentleman that came on to Instagram from
[SPEAKER_00]: Alaska that like buried a bunch of seeds
and he has a lot of cool old stuff from
[SPEAKER_00]: the 80s and he's getting great germination
and so I mean it it's all about storage
[SPEAKER_00]: really and it's about people that have
kept that vibe alive and they're now kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of as the laws are lifting and people are
being more comfortable they're like people
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming out with their treasures and I
think that's it's really it's a kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: gift to the community is that as we
legalize things are kind of coming to the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface that we never really thought we
would.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think that if people do,
you know, how should we say it,
[SPEAKER_02]: metaphorically find the seeds in the dad's
friend's little stash case, do you think
[SPEAKER_02]: that people should, you know, try their
best efforts if possible to try to do a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of a Tom Hill in this situation and,
you know, do the open pollination and try
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, generate that larger stock
pool to work with without bottling necking
[SPEAKER_02]: it such that we can then work further?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think if if something's really
special, I think you should always open
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate it, you know, and I and there's
there's ways to get there's kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: fun tips and ways to get it to have fun
with it and still open pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do like a targeted open
pollination where you do a bunch of seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and you kind of pull out, you know,
the ones that are really not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: good for the gene pool, but who's to say
what that but you can kind of narrow it
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer like a total open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, I'll pick my
favorites, a couple favorites from that
[SPEAKER_00]: open pollination, and I'll save those
backs of clones and kind of work with
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every time I get like a unique seed
line, like I have an old timer friend that
[SPEAKER_00]: once in a while sends me some really
special cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing I always do is I do an
open pollination, make a bunch,
[SPEAKER_00]: send him back some, keep those and then
I'll kind of work from those from the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that I selected from the initial open
pollination that I really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: connected with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think it's important to keep
that gene pool and that kind of open and
[SPEAKER_00]: contained for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you can go back and, you know,
it's great to have that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what if your grow room dies or there's a
storm comes by or, you know, the power's
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to lose clones, but it's hard to
lose seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just kind of moving back to a previous
question, have you found any land races
[SPEAKER_02]: that seem to be particularly compatible
with modern strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, most likely you would have
probably found this through supernatural
[SPEAKER_02]: selections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the flip side of that,
the opposite, you know, have you found any
[SPEAKER_02]: modern strains, you know, maybe an elite
clone, so to speak, that seems to work
[SPEAKER_02]: quite well with land races?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The funny thing is a lot of the elite
clones that work good with land races were
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like older clones that were
originally land races, kind of are ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been kind of inbred quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, I mean, the key to F1 hybrids is
really getting inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're taking two inbred lines and
you're putting them together, they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a lot in common.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring them together, you get that true
F1 hybrid vigor where you're getting this
[SPEAKER_00]: like explosion of life force and you're
getting this really unique combination of
[SPEAKER_00]: genes and they display pretty stable and
pretty similar in that first cross and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just blow everything away.
[SPEAKER_00]: With vigor and they have amazing root
systems and they really shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, I mean, you can F2
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really think the best things to mix
with land races are other highly inbred
[SPEAKER_00]: elite clones or highly inbred clones that
have been kept for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where you get the best
results, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's always fun to play,
like, I think OGs are fun to cross
[SPEAKER_00]: anything into an OG because OG is such a
cool plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to cross a crazy land race,
it's like, then you get these really kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of weird, unique accents or really freaky
buds with an OG smell but a completely
[SPEAKER_00]: different structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of fun to take your favorite
things and just kind of hit them with the
[SPEAKER_00]: magic stick and see what crazy stuff comes
out, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your favorite OG to work with?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then secondly, have you ever found
when you, you know, did hit stuff with the
[SPEAKER_02]: magic stick, so to speak, I like that
expression, by the way, have you ever
[SPEAKER_02]: found that just something just completely,
you know, the most unique exotic smell,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe never even encountered it
before in cannabis, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever had that happen to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think especially with really unique and
special and very, like, especially with,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, the super, super heavy terp plants,
when you put two really unique terp plants
[SPEAKER_00]: together, sometimes you get the weirdest,
wildest smell you would have never
[SPEAKER_00]: thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes they cancel each other
out, which is always weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you get the two smelliest plants and
you're like, oh, this is going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you throw them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, somehow they cancel
their smells out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes you'll get crazy stuff
like you put an OG in a blueberry and you
[SPEAKER_00]: get onions out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, it's like the way the genes
combine is just so amazing and magical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it might be, you know, sometimes it
could be recessive genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be back something that came from,
you know, an earlier, earlier generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think it's just, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I always say find like a
targeted female, like a female that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, and you've always used in your
breeding, that you can put your new pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: on and really see what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see what that kind of brings to
a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think my favorite OG to work
with, it was that Nepali OG, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I no longer have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But out of all the OGs I ever worked with,
that one would always consistently make
[SPEAKER_00]: the best hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, besides the ancient OG,
besides that, Iranian did really good too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that they, you know,
if, if it was an OG, I think that it would
[SPEAKER_00]: it was probably closer to that kind of
grass valley Tahoe kind of a emanation of
[SPEAKER_00]: OG that was there for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's kind of like a point of contention
within the communities, like two schools
[SPEAKER_02]: of thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is that we've made the land races more
potent and maybe arguably more flavorful.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, we have potentially lost certain
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other, the other argument is that the
new, the new strains, while definitively
[SPEAKER_02]: being maybe more flavorful or having
certain flavors that weren't accessible in
[SPEAKER_02]: the land race roots are not as potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that the land races were more
potent and we've watered it down or that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've refined it for the better?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think both things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think human selecting plants to their,
you know, each, each season, smoking the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, finding their favorite things and
just going with that each year and each
[SPEAKER_00]: year is like, that's the amazing thing as
humans we can do is I was thinking of like
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pools is energy and then where the
awareness that we bring to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way I think, you know,
of course, if you've really been deep in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bush, there's a lot of jungly cannabis
and it's pretty junky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wouldn't, a lot of stuff in the
Himalayas, a lot of stuff that's escaped
[SPEAKER_00]: into the wild, even Ireland did escape in
the wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of revert back to their,
their own kind of vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pretty, you know, it's pretty
junky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jungly it's pretty rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, from a rubbing perspective,
it can be some of the best hash ever
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's, you know, these plants are
just, they're horrible to look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the resonant comes off as truly
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's kind of like our duty to
kind of push it in the ways that we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to as artists working with the,
you know, the plant spirit and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the same time, I think we do
lose certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was talking to Rob Clark about
this, like what makes all the old strains
[SPEAKER_00]: so different?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, oh, they were more mono
terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Mexican had this effect because it
had just one kind of terpene signature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like one, you know, like lemon or
something where, and it would take you
[SPEAKER_00]: this way where another one from this,
like Columbia, it was kind of a mono
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene had just the smell and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people remember like these plumbing
rays with a certain smell or Panama with a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so they had these, they weren't
so mashed up the whole global cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool wasn't mashed together in all
these ways, creating all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: genes, expressing themselves and all these
new smells and combinations smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, there was these very distinct
varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had distinct morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had distinct look, they had distinct
smell, taste, and the effect too,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were very specific to their,
you know, single or just a few terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it held their very,
held their uniqueness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we, grew as a cannabis culture and
community and started blending all these
[SPEAKER_00]: things together, you really started to
blend together a lot of the effects kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of almost sometimes getting neat things,
sometimes muddling, but I found that
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really unique and really kind of
really expanded my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, wow, yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it came from a specific place in a
specific environment, the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: forced the plant to do a certain thing and
release certain terpenes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got it in a brick in the seventies or
eighties from this place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's going to have this unique
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we're kind of losing
these unique effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're gaining in the smells and
flavors and aromas and even structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: yields, but we're really losing on the
kind of subtle effects that cannabis has
[SPEAKER_00]: to offer that we no longer kind of
experience in our modern gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting because I've
always wondered, and I posed the question
[SPEAKER_02]: to Mr. Sol, I said, what is it on the
molecular basis do you think that causes a
[SPEAKER_02]: strain to, quote, not have a ceiling?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people often talk about maybe tie,
for example, or haze, not having a
[SPEAKER_02]: ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can just keep getting higher
and higher the more you smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my first thought is, well,
there's got to be some, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: molecular basis for the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess if we kind of think about what
Rob said, if it was a similar kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: thing happening with the terpenes,
that would almost suggest that some
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes are inhibitory.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if maybe mono terpenes led to a
high that didn't have a ceiling,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe multiple terpenes somehow brings in
a ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think, do you have your own little
kind of hypothesis to what's going on
[SPEAKER_02]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I've always kind of
wondered and I always like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even when I would get like an,
say like a broadleaf umica and it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one, you know, I'd be like,
okay, this Kushmar smells kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why does it have an effect,
you know, kind of like a down relaxing
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and this haze, it smells the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does it have an effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what is going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because I, you know,
terpenes are usually, they kind of lead
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, you know, they're either
bolstering or canceling out or making
[SPEAKER_00]: things go through the blood vein barrier
faster or, you know, or yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always wonder that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if it's a combination of
like auxiliary cannabinoids mixed with
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, you know, for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: People thought maybe a lot of the high
elevation and a lot of jungly like
[SPEAKER_00]: equatorials, they had THCV like something
that would kind of lead the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: into, you know, a more effective,
deeper synchronicity with your brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to, this is like one of the
things that fascinates me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that people, as we get more
into genetics and terpenes and auxiliary
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that we'll kind of see,
but yeah, the ceiling thing is wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and even, or even legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like what makes some strains last
for so long?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have some strains that look super
ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke it and I literally can feel like I
drank a coffee and I'll be up all night
[SPEAKER_00]: long, but then I smoke maybe even a
different phenol and it won't do the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where are these ceilingless highs and
these like long legged highs?
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to know because yeah,
I'm, it's a fascinating subject.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it would certainly be interesting
if we could figure out the answer because
[SPEAKER_02]: presumably we could then work towards
incorporating that ceiling-ness,
[SPEAKER_02]: ceiling-lessness, it's probably not the
best way to phrase it, into more strains,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just to talk about, oh sorry,
go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say like, what about,
so, you know, everybody's really into
[SPEAKER_00]: these pens and I know now the kind of
thing is like a rock and abinoid compound
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they're putting these fake,
terpenes like trademark OG combinations,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're running them through the
grasp chromatography and finding which
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes or however they do it in each
strain and then they can kind of mimic
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why, I love, you know, there's people
that make amazing pens and I like pens for
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things like traveling and stuff,
but why does it seem like pens?
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't have the spirit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like this muddled kind of
basic high-ness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't get a lot of different
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be all very similar and then
why if the high is terpene driven,
[SPEAKER_00]: why can't, I mean, you'd think that people
could put in these diverse food-based
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and get similar effects to the
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's got to be something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's something metaphysical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it kind of boggles my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, why can't we recreate?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's obviously something matching going
on we haven't figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for me, I mean it raises a kind of a
parallel issue where that is will we ever
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to or maybe another way of putting
it is are we wasting our time trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: artificially replicate the plant when we
know that it just doesn't seem to really
[SPEAKER_02]: compare, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like do you think that we'd ever get to
the stage where you could get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a capsule or a pen for example
that would completely mimic say,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like ingestion of the whole
plant product via combustion maybe or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that or do you think it's
just still you know, the technology is not
[SPEAKER_02]: there and we don't understand it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's the same thing kind of with,
you know, modern herbalism.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole school of pulling out the
specific phytochemical and standardizing
[SPEAKER_00]: that and then selling that as a natural
medicine versus a whole plant extract
[SPEAKER_00]: versus eating, you know, the herb and it's
like, you know, sometimes people do
[SPEAKER_00]: spagyric like an alchemical extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these ways that people try and
capture the essence of the plant and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think maybe spagyric is probably the best
because it's a more of a metaphysical
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, but you really can't capture the
true, you know, it's like anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't capture the true nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even like live music versus recorded
music and I think really the whole terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: pen thing, I think that's just more of a
commercial thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cost-effective and I think in the
future sadly what we're gonna see is
[SPEAKER_00]: massive, massive, massive cannabis farms
where they're just basically harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: all the tops and making raw THC and
they're adding it into these propylene
[SPEAKER_00]: glycol with their proprietary mixture of
terpenes and you get them at 7-Eleven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think flowers are gonna have a
place in the future except in the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that really love and enjoyment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think legalization we're gonna see just
this mass like kind of blah kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: exposure to just bulk cannabinoids and
flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, I don't really see except,
you know, maybe 5% is gonna be these
[SPEAKER_00]: really deep heads that love their
concentrates and they love their flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: that are, you know, we're really utilizing
these labor intensive practices to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a labor of love versus
commercialization and it's kind of sad.
[SPEAKER_02]: That raises an interesting argument in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw, I think it was in the States,
a farm that was producing some horrible
[SPEAKER_02]: looking plants but their defense was well
this is all just gonna get converted into
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts and so it doesn't actually really
matter but it wasn't just the case that
[SPEAKER_02]: these plants were like, you know,
visually not very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was the case that they were
clearly not very well looked after and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's why they didn't look very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel that that is a disservice or
the fact that they are producing some
[SPEAKER_02]: product for someone who probably needs it
and is better off with that than nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: is a good way to go and I guess the deeper
philosophy of this question ties into the
[SPEAKER_02]: Australian scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm of the opinion that the
medical system that's being prepared to be
[SPEAKER_02]: rolled out in Australia is actually kind
of a farce and so it's like should you
[SPEAKER_02]: accept the sub quality product and in
exchange for having accessibility to it or
[SPEAKER_02]: should you deny that and, you know,
only accept the highest quality of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the proper sort?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's conundrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people generally need
something like basically as a medical
[SPEAKER_00]: thing if they need it for their health and
it's imperative by any means necessary but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, if they have these
scraggly cows that look all diseased and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all caged up and like,
oh, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just making hamburger.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like that's another thing
and people need the protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't eat meat so it's a weird
analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of popped into my weird stoner
brain but it's like I think I really think
[SPEAKER_00]: craft cannabis has been part of our
heritage and it's I think that we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: do everything we can to preserve that but
you know, it's a big world and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge wave coming and it's scary and that's
why another reason why I think people
[SPEAKER_00]: should stop bickering and start
communicating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people shouldn't be fighting and
getting all weird with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there's a huge force.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like something wicked this way comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to engulf everybody and I think
now's the time to create these guilds and
[SPEAKER_00]: create these friendships in these
communities and really everybody come
[SPEAKER_00]: together because we're going to be up
against a serious wall that sees cash over
[SPEAKER_00]: anything and I think we have a little bit
of a window and it's time to kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: with the picture but you know for
medicine, by many means necessary,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think we owe it to our fellow humans
to make a compassionate product that has
[SPEAKER_00]: our heart and soul because half the
healing, you know, even is what you put
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a vital essence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an energy to it and you know,
the body works in mysterious ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know, like even psychosomatic
medicine, you know, placebos and they
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we believe in it with our hearts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I don't know, it's a tough
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so how do you think the organic
versus non-organic argument relates to the
[SPEAKER_02]: quality of the product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you of the opinion that organic will
always kind of be a better product at
[SPEAKER_02]: least holistically as opposed to synthetic
or do you think that it's you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of just down to the skill of the
grower and you've had non-organic product
[SPEAKER_02]: which was quite medicinal or you know,
where do you sit on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it depends, I guess, if you're a
master of your craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally just smoke organic and I love
that it has a connection to the earth and
[SPEAKER_00]: to the you know, the biological web of the
earth and to energy of it, into the dirt,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the fungus and there's a lot of
forces at play but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's also a science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like people have, you know,
I've seen like online like the Jungle
[SPEAKER_00]: Boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like they, I haven't sampled it,
it looks like they have it pretty wired
[SPEAKER_00]: and they produce some pretty amazing
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen how it burned or how it
tastes or what it does but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Science is also another tool that people
wield in very effective and amazing ways
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you can create a quality product
that people enjoy, it's mostly a market
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people want to smoke synthetically
grown cannabis that's grown well,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's their prerogative and if,
I mean, you know, it's more I think a
[SPEAKER_00]: personal preference I think that cannabis
as a plant enjoys being in the soil where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's always been but I mean, I'm not going
to pass any judgment and people do amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs growing, you know, and if they're
passionate about it and if they don't use
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of garbage and they use pure salts,
they don't use any crazy chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: additives or pesticides, fungicides,
I think it's probably okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, do you find that being organic
yourself that makes the maintenance of
[SPEAKER_02]: your mother garden or just your general
garden for example more easier because
[SPEAKER_02]: this is something I'm constantly telling
people is that it's really easy to look
[SPEAKER_02]: after mother plants in organics,
you know, do you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, if you're not
like pulling clones off of them
[SPEAKER_00]: relentlessly, I think, yeah, I think it's
super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in dirt, you just feed it,
you can even just like, I'm pretty like
[SPEAKER_00]: MacGyver, like ghetto style organic
gardener, like I don't have time to be
[SPEAKER_00]: brewing seed teas and doing ferments and
all these amazing things that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: just going for which I find fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I love all these people doing
these crazy things but I don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to be sprouting seed teas and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much just throw it in some good
rich potting soil and top dress with
[SPEAKER_00]: organic amendments, maybe make some teas
here and there, use a few different things
[SPEAKER_00]: but I go for ease because I don't have a
lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to keep everything alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, you know, hundreds of different
strain mother plants that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I kind of, it's like my crown box and
do my hardest to keep them alive but,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if a kid gets sick or I leave on
an adventure and someone doesn't water,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you lose stuff and that's,
it's sad and definitely soil is probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the most friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know people have systems dialed
in where they can look on their cell phone
[SPEAKER_00]: and change things and they get,
there's a camera and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends that are like, oh,
I can leave for two weeks with my hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: system and go to Hawaii and so,
I mean, maybe there's, if you're like
[SPEAKER_00]: Brainiac and you're super good at it,
I mean, conceivably, the stint route could
[SPEAKER_00]: be better but for ease and just throwing
it right in there and just giving it what
[SPEAKER_00]: it wants, I think dirt is the best or,
you know, even cocoa is hard to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: because it dries out so fast and I think
God made dirt and dirt don't hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, kind of expanding on that point,
your library, I imagine that it must
[SPEAKER_02]: contain the biggest differential of growth
between plants in anyone's library.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you must have some plants that
grow three or four times as quickly as
[SPEAKER_02]: others, you know, probably sativa type
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find that you're constantly having
to kind of wrangle these land races
[SPEAKER_02]: compared to, you know, your other strains,
which maybe are a bit more tamed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, a lot of my, it's funny,
the strange thing is a lot of my time
[SPEAKER_00]: actually goes to cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like every week I'm cloning because I
don't want to lose something or things get
[SPEAKER_00]: too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I cut tops off things,
I'm always cloning because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: something can happen or I don't have
backups or, you know, in my mom and dad
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms I have a couple and, you know,
I'm pretty loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the males and the females and the
sativas and the indicas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try and kind of put the indicas on the
front row and the sativas in the back,
[SPEAKER_00]: but things do get crazy and they go in
there, you know, and they all need,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I have it pretty dialed where
everybody gets along and I don't feed too
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy so everything kind of stays the way
it should, but it's hard to keep a library
[SPEAKER_00]: like an encyclopedic or Kaniko of strains,
you know, it's super easy to lose things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not on it, you can get bugs
and things are always growing too fast and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to repot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's hard to, I mean, I wonder how
those botanical gardens keep everything
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they have a whole team,
but it's not easy to keep a library.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can relate and I'm sure mine's
nothing compared to the size of yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so my question was on top of having
a big library, you also seem to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least from what I can see, the breeder
who releases the most of their personal
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was this something you intentionally
wanted to do or just something which kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of happened through, you know,
just kind of generosity, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I always like to give them to
friends and stuff, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: recently it was weird because I,
you know, I have some people saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, you should keep your really special
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you could, you know, trademark them
or sell them to a, in the future to a
[SPEAKER_00]: place, you know, to like when Starbucks
has their cannabis division, their special
[SPEAKER_00]: strain and, you know, like, but for me
it's like, the way things are going,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I love to see whatever he's doing in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody seems to be kind of focusing on
the, you know, cookie, chem, sour,
[SPEAKER_00]: gas thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of amazing things that
are coming out with that, but I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: people to kind of experience other,
other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people go from clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, you know, what's the,
what better way to not only, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: help get people understanding cannabis
from a completely different thing is to
[SPEAKER_00]: give out some special stuff that maybe is
different from other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that people can riff off of or
experience or like, oh, wow, I didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: it could do this or wow, this or that,
or, oh, here's a Steva that's has a great
[SPEAKER_00]: high, but maybe it's quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I was, I saw everybody
hoarding and I was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm just going to do the opposite
of hoarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to start giving away all
the cool stuff because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can always make new stuff,
especially if you have a good seed
[SPEAKER_00]: collection, you can always create new
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the funny thing about elites is
like they all came from seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny how everybody's traces these
elites, but really you could find all
[SPEAKER_00]: these things that are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, if you just have the time
and you, and you're in the keen eye and
[SPEAKER_00]: the passion, you can pretty much pull
anything out of your hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I think it's fun to let,
to share and let people check out new
[SPEAKER_00]: things and experience stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'm just trying to foster like
a kind of an environment of giving and
[SPEAKER_00]: caring and exploration and kind of like
sharing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our buddy Stray Fox had a question
relating to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is radio nursery going to be your main
spot to kind of release your cuts in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, it's funny is like,
I've always like, you know, a few times
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of taken my trays down and tried
to give them out, but I don't have time to
[SPEAKER_00]: make trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my mom room really isn't the cleanest
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm always battling some foreign
invader that's slipping in from our
[SPEAKER_00]: organic garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I felt kind of like a dork trying to
bring in trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, you know, sometimes I get
PM, sometimes I have bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never found, I always wanted to give
it to like a local string place and no one
[SPEAKER_00]: ever, you know, ever kind of, everything
kind of fell through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I met the radio rich people and
they have really good hearts and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a male female combo and they do a
really amazing job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, rad, I would love,
this is a great outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm, they have a bunch of my
stuff and they're mostly putting it out in
[SPEAKER_00]: this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see people grab those clones
and take them other places and get them
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to see them go all over the world
and pretty soon there'll be some
[SPEAKER_00]: supernatural selections cuts going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just some more stuff and some of,
you know, land race, maybe some land race,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, people don't really jive
with it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of just give that to friends,
but a lot of the new supernatural
[SPEAKER_00]: selection stuff is indoor friendly and
it's definitely Sativa Indica hybrids,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're, you know, they have a nominal
flowering time and they still keep their
[SPEAKER_00]: unique character and they're usually
friendly inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want people to, really get
exposed to new things and really get
[SPEAKER_00]: passionate about the total spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, with that kind of point in
mind, would you be able to tell us some
[SPEAKER_02]: more stuff about the Dreadbred and the OMG
that goes into that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've got a friend who's grown out
some hybrids of that and we couldn't find
[SPEAKER_02]: a ton of information on it, but we could
see that it was of land race origins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got excited at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, yeah, it'd be cool to know more
about that one seeing as it is popping up
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot in the tester lines at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just kind of like a male and
I was like, I found a good male that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of matched my favorite female and I was
like, oh, let's try it on some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor stuff and gather it up from some
seeds from some of my land race outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Dreadbred is kind of like the
first release of supernatural selections
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's your basic F1 hybrid between an
Afghani and a Colombian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's Mango Biche and this was like a
seed that I got from a friend who was
[SPEAKER_00]: using Ecuador, Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Mango Biche kind of is like the
blue dream of South America in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like everybody grows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does well in their environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows if it's really an heirloom or
land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been around long enough that it seems
to be some kind of land race or land race
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid that's turned into an heirloom and
it does really well for most of South
[SPEAKER_00]: America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got some seeds and grew out the Mango
Biche and I found one that was really
[SPEAKER_00]: really chirp rich and really special and
really easy to grow and it was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: quick for a Mango Biche.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kept that and then I have this old
Afghani line that I got seeds from a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time ago and it was just called old
Afghani or vintage Afghani and I popped
[SPEAKER_00]: those many years ago and I got this really
beautiful Afghani expression kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it almost seems like it could be a land
race or even maybe one of the really early
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch Afghanis because it it's so resinous
and nice and it has this kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: floral citrus thing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like for a while there was
these Afghanis that came out that were
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of more on the citrus end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it seems like through time
different varieties of Afghanis are popped
[SPEAKER_00]: up from the acrid to the like more berry
smelling to like the bready to the even to
[SPEAKER_00]: the road killy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these different expressions
and this seemed to be one I would kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: have to pick it like in the maybe the 80s
or something where it's highly resinous,
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful, quick, very full, resinous
males, just this perfect breeding Afghani
[SPEAKER_00]: for like a modern kind of mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking that Mango Biche kind of sativa
chirpy rich thing and putting it with a
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice chirpy rich Afghani I got this
really cool it's really cool hybrid and so
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of kind of started that as saying
like okay this is gonna be the first
[SPEAKER_00]: supernatural selections and the funny
thing is I just got we're just starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: pack up the seeds of the new run of the
Dreadbred so people should be able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: those in a couple weeks like and I might
give away a bunch too so people can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of really experience and get them excited
about these new kind of unique hybrids and
[SPEAKER_00]: get them excited about people using them
in their programs and f2ing them and
[SPEAKER_00]: finding stuff and just trying just trying
like really open up that mandala of smells
[SPEAKER_00]: and effects and things just get I don't
know I just want people to get passionate
[SPEAKER_00]: and exposed to the full extreme
possibilities that cannabis has to offer
[SPEAKER_00]: and from there people to really find what
they like and really get into their niche
[SPEAKER_00]: like that's what I I find it hard with
today's breeding kind of modality is
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a few people that are really
finding their niche and driving with it
[SPEAKER_00]: and those are the people that I really
like like you know I never really had a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing for autos I was like oh they make
good houseplants they're you know great
[SPEAKER_00]: for grandma and then you know there's
people these days that it's fine like
[SPEAKER_00]: Mephistoke like he found his niche like
I'm not an auto guy but I see what he's
[SPEAKER_00]: doing I'm like wow you with your passion
and you really going deep you're making
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing things and I think people are you
know there's some some of my friends that
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing that too you know like Doc D and
Stray Fox and Snow High and Coastal Seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and Xam and all these people they're
finding their niche and whether it's be
[SPEAKER_00]: land races or some people just like even
if you're in super into oh geez like take
[SPEAKER_00]: that thing and run with it or people doing
it selfing s1s instead of just bashing up
[SPEAKER_00]: s1 hybrids really go deep start doing s2s
s3s like do some weird stuff just get into
[SPEAKER_00]: it and really explore and find what you
like and just move forward with it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's that's kind of my whole thing
right now is to really it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: the antidote for what the tidal wave of
homogeneity that's like coming and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: hoping that if we can just light up and
left mind and hearts and pallets that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can kind of like reverse this tide of like
that's almost like a global warming of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis you know it's coming and if we
can turn things around we can really
[SPEAKER_02]: create something special awesome answer
because I love Mephisto as well and they
[SPEAKER_02]: actually had a question for you and it was
have you ever come across any really cool
[SPEAKER_00]: land race autos you know that's funny
because I kind of have and I've heard of
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff too you know there's a lot of
things like mighty might which is
[SPEAKER_00]: supposedly an old Nepali indica I've never
seen Indica's in Nepal so I find it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little hard but it's one of those ones it
wasn't you know maybe I had ruralis or
[SPEAKER_00]: something or me is about auto but it was
one of those plants that was kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: semi auto and you know in Morocco a lot of
their plants are kind of auto in a way and
[SPEAKER_00]: I've you know bread I've worked with some
Moroccan plants that I've collected and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like oh wow I could probably slip this
in and I could really kind of kick this
[SPEAKER_00]: things into gear and but you know I
realize it's not it's not really my thing
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm like there's people that are way
more passionate about it and are way more
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable about it and I respect and
I'm just letting them go for it I mean so
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I don't have any plans to really do
autos or really do it but there are you
[SPEAKER_00]: know besides ruralis there's some Afghanis
like there's that auto Afghani there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some plants just due to their geography
and due to their selection over time have
[SPEAKER_00]: created some of these these tendencies
where they grow when they hit a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: size or they grow when they hit a certain
duration I mean it's out there and but I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that the auto spectrum has been
pretty dialed you know especially over in
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain they're so autoed out and all the
auto feminized now that they've kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: got it wired they've got these genes kind
of locked in for what they want to do and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially now in America with some of the
auto people here I think it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: done deal almost you know what I mean for
sure and so just to loop back on another
[SPEAKER_02]: point you made earlier about S1s or
feminized seeds how do you feel about them
[SPEAKER_02]: you know you've never done them yourself
is that because you're not interested or
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't feel they're as good as
regulars?
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a long time ago I tried I got my
STS and I did all that and it was just I
[SPEAKER_00]: just made a mess out of everything else
horrible I couldn't get out to work and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was kind of it was just kind of more my
whole thing on it was like I wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: unlock the gene pool if I could S1 or S2
you can really crack open a strain before
[SPEAKER_00]: we had like the whole genetic testing and
you know you could really kind of see what
[SPEAKER_00]: was in there you could see maybe it's
parents it's grandparents you could kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of you know that's the unique thing about
selfing stuff is you could you can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: see what's in there and some you know some
of my friends that do a lot of S1 work is
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll get you know 40 plants that look
exactly alike and then they'll get five
[SPEAKER_00]: that are like completely different so it
was this like kind of something that was
[SPEAKER_00]: back in its history and it's it's a really
unique tool but for me you know it's I
[SPEAKER_00]: know it does happen in nature but for me I
just I don't know maybe it's just I like
[SPEAKER_00]: just basic sexual breeding you know I just
like to bring males and females together
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's my jam that's my niche and
that's kind of what I do and you know for
[SPEAKER_00]: a while I was kind of down on autos I mean
autos sorry at one point FEMS and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really understand it as much
until I met people that really just truly
[SPEAKER_00]: had a way with it you know like Inspector
he does amazing autos our Illuminati you
[SPEAKER_00]: know Incognito he does crazy good autos
Matt Riot does amazing autos some people
[SPEAKER_00]: have them they just have the they have a
gift and they have they know what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and they push it in different
directions I'm not a big fan of the taking
[SPEAKER_00]: that like a basically your kind of flavor
of the week taking an elite cologne and
[SPEAKER_00]: feminizing it and spraying it on
everything sure there's gonna be unique
[SPEAKER_00]: things in that but it's kind of I mean
that's just really kind of a kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: short-sighted short gut it's easy I mean
it is I guess I can't really pass judgment
[SPEAKER_00]: it does it it is cool but it's kind of I
call that kind of like your that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like the kindergarten level of breeding
because you because you you know I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: in it not an derogatory sense I mean like
as a kid like you're so excited you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to have fun you want it fast you want to
see what this does what happens if you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I put this Lego on this like it it's
great it serves its purpose but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's I think some of the deep magic comes
from the real work that people put into
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff so I think selfing is you know I
used to not think it was that great now
[SPEAKER_00]: people have changed my mind people change
my mind every day that's what I love about
[SPEAKER_00]: this community is people when they're
passionate and they find their niche they
[SPEAKER_00]: truly can create magic that hasn't
happened before so I give them props to
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone that does that yeah it's
interesting it almost reminds me of like a
[SPEAKER_02]: spray and pray type of approach
interesting you brought up Matt you know
[SPEAKER_02]: we had Matt on the show a little while ago
I think what's most interesting about your
[SPEAKER_02]: friendship with him and what people seem
to be interested in at least is how kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of polar opposite you guys are as people
you know like how did you meet Matt and do
[SPEAKER_02]: you find in general you're drawn towards
people who are quite different to
[SPEAKER_02]: personality wise or do you find you're
more kind of likely to hang with someone
[SPEAKER_00]: who's more similar to you I don't know you
know for friends it's I think more similar
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely met people online and in
person that you know that we're much
[SPEAKER_00]: different we probably wouldn't be friends
if we didn't have cannabis in our lives to
[SPEAKER_00]: geek out on but really you know if people
are if people are cool to me I'm cool to
[SPEAKER_00]: them I don't try and create an attitude I
try and meet people at a basic human level
[SPEAKER_00]: you know people don't rub me on the wrong
way or they you know are arrogant or this
[SPEAKER_00]: and that but if someone is is really
themselves they have a personality they're
[SPEAKER_00]: even a character like I'll give them the
space to be who they are and for Matt like
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I met back in the kind of the
older forum days when it was more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: small community and he was doing something
really cool he was working you know he was
[SPEAKER_00]: he was trying to create a medical garden
for patients and I think this is where he
[SPEAKER_00]: got a lot of the bad rap is he was started
to ask a lot of breeders for seeds because
[SPEAKER_00]: he wanted to do a lot of different stuff
for this this medical garden that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: part of and it you know is very altruistic
and I was like sure and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: said sure and I guess it all fell through
and and it didn't happen and he still had
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds but that's okay if people give
seeds altruistically and I think he made
[SPEAKER_00]: later on maybe he was gonna there was an
auction and maybe one or two of those seed
[SPEAKER_00]: packs came up and it's like once you get
people seeds like who cares what they do
[SPEAKER_00]: with them and I think people got uptight
and they you know and then all these
[SPEAKER_00]: rumors started and then as people come on
later in life they don't really go back
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at the actual information they
just hear the rumors and take them for
[SPEAKER_00]: point-blank and I know that he rubs people
the wrong way but he that's his service I
[SPEAKER_00]: think in our characters this community
where there's many characters and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: many people that have vital positions and
his service is to call people out and not
[SPEAKER_00]: take any BS and to be a punker and you
know I I think we have a place for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody and I know people some people
hate him some people love him he's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: guy we share a lot of stuff on music and
he's got a kind heart but he doesn't take
[SPEAKER_00]: any BS and I kind of like him for that and
I like him for that he he doesn't take a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of flack and he almost you know I he's
almost like a punching bag a lot I think a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people are spared because he takes
a lot of the hits and I think that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: his vital in a way to keeping everything
fresh and fluid I think everybody plays a
[SPEAKER_00]: part and if everybody comes you know if
everybody's communicating from their mind
[SPEAKER_00]: in their heart I think there's room for
everybody and I like Matt I think he's a
[SPEAKER_00]: cool guy and we get along great and
there's a there's a lot of characters like
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the cannabis world that are kind
of where our personalities are kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot different but we share a passion for
things and I think that's in any community
[SPEAKER_00]: so yeah I cherish those kind of characters
and people in our community that are a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: different that are kind of pushing things
just add to that we also love Matt and his
[SPEAKER_02]: take no shit attitude so just on a bit of
a different topic when is a project done
[SPEAKER_02]: for you you know are you someone who sets
deadlines on things do you think well if
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not working by this point I'm gonna
move on or do you kind of go by feel and
[SPEAKER_02]: you think now I'm gonna stick with it till
it feels like it's done you know for me I
[SPEAKER_00]: have lots of projects like I do a lot of
hybrid work and then for my kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: personal projects where I'm doing you know
people don't think I really line breed
[SPEAKER_00]: that much but I have a lot of different
things I've line bred I just kind of keep
[SPEAKER_00]: them more for myself as my own breeding
tools or to make them more inbred so that
[SPEAKER_00]: I can use them with other inbred things I
don't really release so much lime but
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff because I really it's my personal
work that I make kind of for myself or for
[SPEAKER_00]: my toolbox and you know recently I kind of
got some slack online and I realized okay
[SPEAKER_00]: so you know I hear what people saying and
and I get it and and so now I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like oh you know I'm gonna start I'm gonna
start letting out some of my line work you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I have a I have my purple unicorn
lion is like at f4 and I think my dragon's
[SPEAKER_00]: blood is at f5 or 6 and I have you know I
have some lucky charms I have a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: strains I've bred out and I think you know
especially as things go extinct I might
[SPEAKER_00]: start releasing some of my line bred stuff
my whole theory was that I like to people
[SPEAKER_00]: to buy f1 hybrid to get something special
and then if they want to go deeper and
[SPEAKER_00]: spot they can do f2s and they can find
things that look like just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents and they can really pick out what
they like not what I like like I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to tell you what's cool I'm trying
to give you a maximum gene pool to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with so you can really find what you like
and that was my whole thing but now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: finding that people kind of do want to
know what kind of I like and what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing things to so I'm gonna release
some of my kind of like my more work lines
[SPEAKER_00]: and I hope that makes people happen I hope
that they can use them in their own
[SPEAKER_02]: programs so with that in mind do you have
a preferred type of project like do you
[SPEAKER_02]: find that f1s bring you the most kind of
happiness or do you like to line breed but
[SPEAKER_02]: you know you just don't see it as
necessarily fit for public release like
[SPEAKER_02]: what how would you rank things in terms of
you know f1s line breedings I guess Fem
[SPEAKER_00]: would be at the bottom by definition yeah
you know I personally like f1s at goes it
[SPEAKER_00]: there's something magic about two things
meeting for the first time there's this
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and even even nature
congratulates a true f1 in hybrid vigor
[SPEAKER_00]: like in people too if you have like you
know when the French colonized Vietnam you
[SPEAKER_00]: get these combination like look at women
women are amazing aren't they the most
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful they're like these they're like
these walking biological flowers and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you take her and say a Vietnamese man and
a French woman you know in Vietnam they
[SPEAKER_00]: breed it creates these amazing special
things and I love that and that's why I
[SPEAKER_00]: like and even my you know my philosophical
and my religious beliefs are based in this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of combination of energy and
awareness or basically male and female
[SPEAKER_00]: these polarities and I love when these
things come together and that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: what I like to give out and then you know
all these other projects like I've had a
[SPEAKER_00]: roadkill skunk project going for years and
years and years and I just piddled away at
[SPEAKER_00]: it and I you know I do so much work behind
the scenes with all these different kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of projects I do have a lot of weird
projects purple projects and land race
[SPEAKER_00]: projects and I do a lot of I do a lot of
line breeding primarily it's just really
[SPEAKER_00]: for myself and really for making my my
toolkit a lot easier to deal with you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a really big proponent of making your
own tools and making your own things to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with you know I think that's is as we
get more proficient in cannabis breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and combining we can really do things that
people never really even imagine you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do so for me I like to keep a lot of
personal projects always open they can
[SPEAKER_00]: take years even short-term little fun
things but a majority of my stuff does
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to be in those just in those F1
hybrids and that's kind of what the market
[SPEAKER_00]: wants like if I just did if I only did an
Eureka I would be living out a cardboard
[SPEAKER_00]: box like you know I mean what sells is the
is these is the mashups like the special
[SPEAKER_00]: male and elite mashups everybody wants the
new best thing they want the terp heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: new flavors and you know and I try and
develop my my special males as I you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I try and think of a head a little bit and
see where the market's going and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: people are into and I kind of base my new
males on that and then I release things
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know people say I release a lot of
stuff and I do because I've made a hell of
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of seeds I've been doing this for a
long time and I make big runs of seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep them in the fridge I vacuum seal
them and I test them and sometimes I may
[SPEAKER_00]: you know things I made six years ago are
just now seeing the face of they maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't get tested right or someone
disappeared or I never got around to them
[SPEAKER_00]: and so when things good things come about
as when I usually release them and it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to work and it gives the illusion of
this massive workflow when really it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just this dance through time and and
selection that was my cat yeah he's all
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah so if we just jump into the idea of
line breeding a little further I've had a
[SPEAKER_02]: few questions from people regarding the
sunshine daydream if it'll ever be done as
[SPEAKER_02]: a line as opposed to our crosses because
obviously there's some hybrids of it
[SPEAKER_02]: floating around at the moment will you
ever consider f2ing it f3ing it yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah you know I think I do a big searching
through lines in the summer when I can
[SPEAKER_00]: have them outside and then sometimes I'll
bring them inside you do like a utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: our outdoor season by into like threes
I'll plant stuff early and when it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: mature I'll throw it in my flower room and
I'll kind of do that three times so I can
[SPEAKER_00]: really move through a lot of stuff and you
know maybe next year you know each year I
[SPEAKER_00]: pick I pick a couple of my lines and I
really kind of look deep to see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on and this year it was a I did a
big dirty hippie seed pop which is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically you know I mean dirty hippie f2
and then I also did a big tiger melon so
[SPEAKER_00]: those are kind of the two right now that
I'm kind of going through and seeing if I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to take it further and kind of see
what opens up in the f2 so yeah I think
[SPEAKER_00]: any line that that is really special I can
always revisit it and I really do and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's definitely Sunday and daydream is
one that I really love and I would love to
[SPEAKER_00]: just do it just so I can get another cut
cut back because through time and space
[SPEAKER_00]: I've lost both of my favorite females so
I'm kind of I don't even have any sunshine
[SPEAKER_00]: daydream and it is a really special plant
and how it works to the body and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: eases like the neurological pain that
people have and a lot of it seems it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: to be like one of my more medical
orientated strains even more so than like
[SPEAKER_00]: the good medicine or the barefoot doctor
and some of those CBD rich ones like it is
[SPEAKER_00]: a really special strain that's kind of why
I retired that mail I didn't go for it
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's like it's a strain where it's
like I don't think anything's absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect but it's one of the strains that
kind of stands on its own and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really need to be me to be messed with and
I kind of only pulled that sunshine
[SPEAKER_00]: daydream mail back out again because
through a mishap I lost the mail that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to use on a pollination and I
was like well you know what I have this
[SPEAKER_00]: really old sunshine daydream mail that I
use a long time for this to go for the
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshine for and stuff I'm just gonna
throw it in there you know it's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: plant it should make some really fun stuff
and that's how this kind of came about and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I decided to kind of kill that mail
so that those will be really special and
[SPEAKER_00]: people can kind of go through them and
that also too that it makes me want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through more and really dig deeper into
lines and I think that's really nice kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like going it's kind of like you know
visiting an old lover in a way you know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like there's you cherish that and you
get to come back and you know there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: familiarity you kind of know what you're
looking for but at the same time you're
[SPEAKER_00]: excited and it feels so good and so do you
still have the Baba shine I don't you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that's sad that's one I lost and I lost
the bubble shine mail and the funny thing
[SPEAKER_00]: is the story about the Appalachia mail
would have never been used if I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have lost the bubble shine mail at the
last second the bubble shine was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the big pollinator that of all those
hybrids that were the Appalachia so I just
[SPEAKER_00]: lost the female to dudding which is a
strange thing that really drives me nuts
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of affecting a lot of people
that no one seems to really know what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is but I have made it quite a bit of
hybrids with it and I actually have a new
[SPEAKER_00]: mail I'm kind of looking into right now
I'm playing around with it's a bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: shine instant Karma cross so that's kind
of my current bubble shine kind of play
[SPEAKER_02]: around with kind of thing I'm doing okay
you mentioned your CBD projects where does
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD kind of sit for you in the scheme of
breeding you know I know that the CBD
[SPEAKER_02]: lines you have released in the past were
mostly freebies and there's some
[SPEAKER_02]: information around them that you release
you know just kind of saying oh you know I
[SPEAKER_02]: had these laying around I just wanted to
get them out to people do you plan to
[SPEAKER_02]: restock those or potentially work them
further and the reason why I ask this is
[SPEAKER_02]: because I had a friend who had good
medicine and he thought it was just like
[SPEAKER_02]: the best plan he'd ever had just even in
you know a recreational sense sorry and um
[SPEAKER_02]: and he was really bummed out he lost it
and I was like damn it'd be good to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some more of those yeah I mean I can
always get you some I still have kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: all I think I made like I think I have
like a dozen CBD maybe more maybe like 15
[SPEAKER_00]: different CBD hybrids you know originally
it was more just exploring that medical
[SPEAKER_00]: side it was when I first made the good
medicines it was back before everybody was
[SPEAKER_00]: in to CBD there was only really harlequin
and then I don't know if ACDC was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state so much then and I was like you know
I want to explore this I want to you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I my emphasis on really for me is like I
love recreational I love medical but
[SPEAKER_00]: really my thing is I want to create spirit
nursing strains like strains that awaken
[SPEAKER_00]: something inside you that's kind of either
dormant or you're that you're cultivating
[SPEAKER_00]: but for CBD I was so interested and that
was right around the time that SC labs
[SPEAKER_00]: opened in our in our in Santa Cruz kind of
where I live and I was like you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: this is cool I'm gonna try this out I you
know I took in my samples I took in my
[SPEAKER_00]: early leaf samples for my males I think
it's like six years ago five years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: found that and played around and I was
really excited to see wow like it was just
[SPEAKER_00]: another one of those things like what is
gonna happen and with the good medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I found a CBD rich male and I
took it to the f2 and then I released
[SPEAKER_00]: those and then with that I I started
pollinating a lot of stuff with the good
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine a lot of the other CBD clothes
were coming out like the Amrita and the
[SPEAKER_00]: ACDC and then even things like heroin
things special things I made a CBD OG one
[SPEAKER_00]: that people like and then the the logical
conclusion for like a really I was like
[SPEAKER_00]: okay Sunshine Daydreams probably like one
of my favorite pain relieving strains what
[SPEAKER_00]: if I made a CBD rich sunshine daydream and
that's what kind of barefoot doctor is and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's kind of the one I think I will push
forward if I do but you know I give I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I've given away over yeah thousands
of packs of seeds for free because I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really I think it's funny when people
charge a lot of money for the CBD rich
[SPEAKER_00]: strains like that's our Trojan horse to
get get cannabis into like basically all
[SPEAKER_00]: of America that it that have been like
totally brainwashed if there's a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that can heal their kids that can heal
their grand parents I think we get give
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds out like you know I think
somebody should just devote a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse and just pump out a million CBD
seeds get those things everywhere like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's truly our Trojan horse to get into
the hearts and minds of people that have
[SPEAKER_00]: no clue and so my whole thing is I don't
spend as much time on the CBD work is
[SPEAKER_00]: because I just give it all away free and I
usually always try and make each
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination run a couple CBD strains like
I'll usually throw in an ACDC or harlequin
[SPEAKER_00]: into anything I'm making but for my
specific CBD projects I think the good
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and the barefoot doctor were like
the ones that I really put enough the most
[SPEAKER_00]: time into and I love it when I see people
make more of those or use those in their
[SPEAKER_00]: own project like I think the medical
aspect is amazing and it's beautiful and I
[SPEAKER_00]: really think that's one of the ways that
we're really gonna see cannabis basically
[SPEAKER_00]: become the our main plant on earth like
it's always been since you know that in
[SPEAKER_02]: the dawn of time and so which cannabis
right which CBD strain do you like to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with the most I guess in in all regards
because I mean I've personally have had
[SPEAKER_02]: ACDC and I thought that was fantastic and
then on the other hand I've heard breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: say that Charlotte's web for example while
being a great strain doesn't particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: work very well for breeding or at least I
heard that in the sense that it's not very
[SPEAKER_02]: true breeding like not a lot of the
resulting seeds will carry those really
[SPEAKER_02]: high CBD traits or at least I'm told that
with that in mind which kind of CBD cuts
[SPEAKER_02]: do you shine more to or do you find work
better for your projects well I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean I think why Charlotte's web doesn't
totally work out is because it wasn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: a finished product it I think those guys
kind of heisted it from another breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: that was working on CBD rich plants and I
don't think he fully it was just a one-off
[SPEAKER_00]: for one of the stuff and I think he's
perfected I think it's from a man in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado who that we all know and love and
his name has a numeric number in it but I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to ruffle any feather so I
think that's probably why you see
[SPEAKER_00]: Charlotte's web doesn't work is I think it
wasn't a fully realized line I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: was something that is kind of grabbing
around with I personally like Harlequin
[SPEAKER_00]: myself because it does seem to be true
breeding it's not it's not coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain and that whole Z7 like that whole
you know CBD crew and they tend to be kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of territorial and about their stuff and
they tend to be a little you know a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit snooty so I try and stay away from any
kind of drama and Harlequin was brought to
[SPEAKER_00]: America by I think as a seed form by Wayne
Wade laughter and it's an old I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a Dutch or Swiss or some kind of old
combination that they had there that just
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed that and it's kind of the first
one we had in California and I think even
[SPEAKER_00]: in the States and I've always kind of just
connected more with that and it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a beautiful plant and it has it's
very resonance and you know ACDC is
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome it really pumps the CBD and it's
very true reading it really crushes it on
[SPEAKER_00]: that but it it's kind of like a wiley kind
of almost sativa like plant you know it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a pretty kind of just a giant bush and I
mean I've made some crosses with it that
[SPEAKER_00]: it come out great and I've kind of tamed
the beast but I think if I had to choose a
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD rich cultivar it would probably be the
Harlequin although you know coastal seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: he's finding that some of their Panama red
work is coming up rich in CBD and which is
[SPEAKER_00]: really amazing and you know that kind of
goes back to the whole adage of people
[SPEAKER_00]: like oh yeah Panama red that stuff will
knock you out that was like the tequila
[SPEAKER_00]: bud like it you know even back in the day
Panama red was kind of known as kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like this knock you on your ass stuff and
that makes sense that it maybe was a
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa that had some level of kind of us
CBD in it yeah if we just take a step back
[SPEAKER_02]: and look at just breeding in general not
necessarily CBD how do you find the
[SPEAKER_02]: location of where you breed affects things
do you find that when you I mean obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: there's going to be physical differences
I've read that I believe it was the China
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuan strain on one of your Instagram post
said it doesn't particularly perform well
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors so we'll put that bit aside
instead let's look at the breeding aspect
[SPEAKER_02]: if you were to try to breed that plant
indoor do you think that would have you
[SPEAKER_02]: know kind of epigenetic effects on the
seeds resulting and just like so do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think that land race lines should be
ideally bred outside if possible because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gonna you know maybe be more
synergistic with their genetics or what's
[SPEAKER_00]: your feeling on this I mean you know back
like 10 years ago I would say that they
[SPEAKER_00]: probably I mean that's a tough one it's I
don't know I think that you can with if
[SPEAKER_00]: you put your will to anything I think you
can work with the plant and basically get
[SPEAKER_00]: it to perform anywhere and I think that
before during prohibition most people were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing inside so it was important to to
try and push that gene pool into more
[SPEAKER_00]: harmonious expressions inside like you
wanted to try you need definitely land
[SPEAKER_00]: races freak out like especially ones that
you you know like I have a lot of problems
[SPEAKER_00]: when I bring land races from like the
Himalayas and I plant them straight out
[SPEAKER_00]: here at sea level like they go cuckoo they
don't know what's going on they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're used to being up in these high
elevations in this certain environment all
[SPEAKER_00]: of a sudden now they're in the fog line at
the beach like they really tweak out so I
[SPEAKER_00]: think you can create a more harmonious
environment for them indoors if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really catering to them but I think it's
important though to if you are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make land race hybrids that they are
stable indoors like that's the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why supernatural selection has been
so hard and it's taken so long to release
[SPEAKER_00]: all these things is because it's not easy
to to mate land races and expect them to
[SPEAKER_00]: do well inside like they do crazy stuff
they do weird stuff there they're very
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic indoors they did you know
and that's the whole thing with my
[SPEAKER_00]: roadkill stunt project I can make sure I
make plants that smell like roadkill and
[SPEAKER_00]: get you super high and then they hit all
the you know they've got all the eyes and
[SPEAKER_00]: they check all the boxes but they they
don't like to be indoors like for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason the one I'm working on it's just
it's about finding the specific outcross
[SPEAKER_00]: so they don't things a lot of things just
don't like being in an artificial
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and they express that so I
think there is some magic in really
[SPEAKER_00]: working a line indoors to remove the
hermaphroditic traits but also outdoors if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can you can create some amazing
heirlooms if you say say you went to
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand and you were in Chiang Rai or
something and you got a sack of pot and
[SPEAKER_00]: you got some seeds and you loved it and
you brought it home and you grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: outside in your garden it may tweak out it
may herm out the first time you grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: but then you find your favorites you breed
those you get the seeds you grow it again
[SPEAKER_00]: after three or four times of it
experiencing a new environment it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to reprogram itself and it's going to
adapt to the new environment and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to slowly become your kind of
personal heirloom so it's all about I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: it's about doing the work really on those
things it's you know it's not just taking
[SPEAKER_00]: these these hyper terpy amazing plants
that are all been bred indoors that are
[SPEAKER_00]: you know in slapping together that's it's
easy but trying to get things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: from completely different environments and
bring them together in a new thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: really difficult it's like that it's like
that Eddie Murphy movie what was he was
[SPEAKER_00]: like an African king and they dropped him
off in New York something King of Queens
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that yeah it's like the
same thing you get a plant from that you
[SPEAKER_00]: drop it off here you got to do some work
on that thing you can't you know it's yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: so strange things happen and that's the
beauty that's why I really tell people
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like explore the gene pool you know
collect seeds collect as many seeds you
[SPEAKER_00]: can trade seeds like get a good seed
collection find crazy cultivators travel
[SPEAKER_00]: like really give yourself all the colors
you can to create your your art you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and also don't let anybody ever tell you
that you're breeding the wrong way like
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one thing I you know I have deep
respect for all the horticultural science
[SPEAKER_00]: people and I have a background kind of in
that but really you know no one can tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you how to breed the proof is in the
pudding if you can create something good
[SPEAKER_00]: with your skills and the way you do it
then that's all that matters and it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't need a Mendel square you need
like you need good senses you need an open
[SPEAKER_00]: heart open mind you need to create
awareness with the plant and you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything you never let anyone and all
these people like oh I you know I went to
[SPEAKER_00]: horticultural science that's beautiful you
know you can learn all about a paintbrush
[SPEAKER_00]: you can learn all about paint you can
learn all about canvas but that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: make you a good artist so I say to people
just follow their passion grab you know
[SPEAKER_00]: really get into this and really make it
something that nourishes you and your
[SPEAKER_00]: community and don't let anyone tell you
what to do and also don't tell anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: what they can't do everybody needs to get
along and really and really do this I
[SPEAKER_00]: think we have a great community and a
great future ahead of us if we can just
[SPEAKER_02]: keep our eyes on the prize so I think you
already answered it a little bit with that
[SPEAKER_02]: last answer but what would be your advice
for a new breeder and by this I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: someone who's maybe thinking about getting
into breeding not someone who's just
[SPEAKER_00]: started I would say you know for new
breeders is a start growing plants grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of different plants find what you
enjoy find what you like and then kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to that like if there's a plant that
speaks to you or a certain strain then
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah take that work with that mix it with
something else you like build up your seed
[SPEAKER_00]: collection trade trade clones you know
really get into that form a community make
[SPEAKER_00]: friends like I think that's the best thing
and you know what as a beginner give away
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds make cool stuff give away your seeds
get the hype out it's like and you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: also too is like for me I don't call
myself a breeder I call myself kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like an artist or I kind of just work with
the plant maybe I'm just a plant helper I
[SPEAKER_00]: really think that using your senses and
even using your sixth sense like my the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole thing I think is like a heart race
breeding it's like you know there you have
[SPEAKER_00]: your five senses but you also have a sixth
sense that sense of kind of this knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's basically your heart you know
your heart has an electromagnetic force
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,000 times bigger than your mind it
radiates out like five feet and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where people you know they get a
where you can kind of feel things out and
[SPEAKER_00]: if you can tune into that that's where you
can connect with nature that's also where
[SPEAKER_00]: people get their sixth sense or they have
this funny feeling about something or they
[SPEAKER_00]: connect with something that's like the
hearts electromagnetic field interacting
[SPEAKER_00]: with other things and I think cultivating
that and cultivating an awareness of
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and the plant being a good person
and being friendly and being humble I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's the best way to start out
breeding and just if you have passion and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have your senses intact then you're
you're all the way there pretty much you
[SPEAKER_00]: just got to move forward
[SPEAKER_01]: stay tuned for part two you
you you you you you you you
