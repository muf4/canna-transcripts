[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty, so a big thank you and welcome
to the one and only, the OG master
[SPEAKER_02]: himself, Karma.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing I wanted to ask you,
what are you currently smoking on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking on some sour mamba at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, what's that one again?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a mamba cut times a sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do you find that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: More sativa, more indica?
[SPEAKER_00]: This Fino is a bit more on the sour side,
but it's like typical hybrid weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wouldn't call it sativa,
even though it flowers a bit longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a bit looser in butt strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And overall, would you describe yourself
as more of an indica or a sativa guy?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I really smoke the whole spectrum,
but like, depends on what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for every occasion, yeah,
there is like a different weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do like smoke sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke sativas more during the day or
when I'm going into nature, when I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: artwork, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I like smoking sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the end of the day, in the evenings and
stuff, then I'm all about OGs and heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: indicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I can very much relate on that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take us back.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me start off with, I'm Dutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born in the seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, when I was like pretty young,
it was pretty accepted in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I smoked my first joint when I was like
13.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Moroccan hashish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in those days, there wasn't even
that much weed here yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like Jamaican and Thai weed,
a little bit of the first Dutch type
[SPEAKER_00]: growing weed, which was not that
impressive, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, most people smoke Moroccan hash
in those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I got a little piece of Moroccan
hash and tried smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And was it in a joint or just through like
a pipe or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was in a joint with Dutch tobacco
and yeah, it wasn't that good.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest either, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to cough a lot because I didn't,
I never smoked anything before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So did you get high the first time you
smoked?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was really nauseous as well,
I think from smoking tobacco for a start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting how interlinked tobacco
and hash are within the Netherlands scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a trend you continued to do as you
kept smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I smoke my weed pure now these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still smoke like Moroccan and Nepalese
hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do smoke that with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke weed pure because tobacco like it
ruins the whole flavor of it, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always smoke weed pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke mostly bongs, not so much weed in
joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a man after my own heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to have a session.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're hitting all the points that I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I found very interesting is my
first ever weed experience, I think it was
[SPEAKER_02]: 2009, 2010, I went to Holland and I tried
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was before I was really into weed
seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just when I was starting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't remember too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like sadly, I didn't try all the different
strains, all that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I remember trying the hash and I tried
it with tobacco and there's this
[SPEAKER_02]: undeniable actually, I say, kind of
romance within like when you mix tobacco
[SPEAKER_02]: and hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And though I'm pretty strictly
anti-tobacco, I'll let people off if
[SPEAKER_02]: they're smoking hash with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you think it blends together so
well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the Dutch culture, the first
hashish that came or came from Morocco and
[SPEAKER_00]: Nepal and Afghanistan, there they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all smoke it with tobacco.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that has to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What started it off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days people here, they are,
it's just how they're used to it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not much people that smoke pure
weed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even most people here still smoke with
tobacco and that counts for a big part of
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last years, it starts to change a
little bit, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, Bodhi raised this point many,
many moons ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: The art of mixing or blending different
herbs together hasn't really been explored
[SPEAKER_02]: too much, especially outside of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you rule out hash, do you think there's
something more there that we could learn
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of in the way that concentrates
evolved?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it's kind of limited?
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think different herbs in
combination with cannabis can give
[SPEAKER_00]: different effects because I mean,
the tobacco, even when you smoke weed with
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco, yeah, it makes it feel,
you get a very different high than when
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoke weed pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Moroccans used to say that by,
if you wouldn't mix tobacco with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you would fly away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that it keeps you on the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a cool idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what type of hash is your favorite
then?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer like high quality Nepalese,
but that's very rare these days,
[SPEAKER_00]: also here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Moroccan, I still smoke mostly
Moroccan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very picky though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from what's here, I probably can only
smoke like the top 5%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think a lot of people can relate to
that point even if it just came down to
[SPEAKER_02]: flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess I'd love to know from you,
what are your top picks for the coffee
[SPEAKER_02]: shops in Amsterdam?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you just not even go to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: These days, I almost don't go to them
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for good hashies and nice hazes most
of the time, it's the old Damkring on the
[SPEAKER_00]: Handboekstraat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very fair priced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The names are really real.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get really what's fucking on the menu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like all the modern stuff,
one of my young friends, he does the blog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has all the modern new stuff that all
the younger people like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else is good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Voyager.
[SPEAKER_00]: Voyager is really, really nice people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a smaller menu, but it's always
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care a lot for what they put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those three shops are probably good ones
to visit if you go to Amsterdam at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solid advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can never say it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it the Damkring?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just probably cut and paste your one
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Damkring.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they say in Dutch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damkring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear about it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a smoke circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of if you translate it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you think they became like the
cream of the crop?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everyone talks about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they always been very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now a friend of mine runs the old
Damkring and he's just a guy that cares a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot about all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He cares a lot about of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been in it really long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a great network.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just, he's very honest and he cares
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, he's willing to pay a bit more when
it's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just, he's just a fair,
a fair guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which for a lot of the Amsterdam coffee
shops, they're so commercial now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll put on names, all kinds of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is still like an old style,
fair, honest menu and also the good people
[SPEAKER_00]: running it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really good to hear that there are
a few shops who are still embodying those
[SPEAKER_02]: good traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd love if you could just take me back
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it like through, you know,
kind of that Renaissance of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: scene, probably, you know, late eighties,
early nineties, when all of the big Dutch
[SPEAKER_02]: companies were still in existence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, Neville was kind of there
doing his thing and all the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you a part of the scene back then?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I started growing in the late
eighties, early nineties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those first times were just like a few
plants that outdoor and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still pretty young at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from 95, I really, really started to
kick it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the fun thing is like these days
here, it's not as free as it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember back in the day, I could have
like cannabis plants in the front of my
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was living behind the police station
and there was never a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can't do anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely not possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so was there like good quality
genetics floating around at that time or
[SPEAKER_02]: it was still a bit limited?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that until early 2000s,
there was quite a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because there was a lot of
small growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like moms,
[SPEAKER_00]: people that only live in like a small
house do a little bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a lot of people that are like
home growers that do like small rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a lot of diversity and also a
lot of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they changed the rule here that they
could kick you out of your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all these small ones kind of
stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was in early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really changed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there was more diversity before
2005 than after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it started to go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what were the first strains that you
were growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: My first things were Viking, early girl,
silver pearl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the first things I grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very interesting that you mentioned
Viking, because that's one which gets
[SPEAKER_02]: thrown around a bit in Australia is one of
the possible strains that's used for the
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial cash cropping scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get the impression that that's
what the strain really was?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like a pretty early finishing
outdoor variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very wild, so it's very leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was very strong and it makes huge
bucks as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did yield a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we grew it outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it was for here at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it as a clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so were clones passed around rather
freely back at that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was even legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you even had ads in the newspaper and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you think that this may have
kind of led to people getting questionable
[SPEAKER_02]: clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those days it was not that commercial and
it was still everybody that ran it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like old hippies and the
hippie people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so it was very different
type of scene in those days as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, it was all positive.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a different world back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when was kind of the first time you
started to look at the idea of breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was when I was working in a coffee
shop for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the things you get offered to buy,
because that was my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to like stand at the back door,
as they call it in Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there wasn't that much diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was because the grow shops,
which is where the clones were sold in
[SPEAKER_00]: those days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only had like two or three different
things you could pick from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody in that neighborhood would
grow only those two or three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dutch people didn't grow with seeds a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so spoiled by having those clones
from early on and just getting them at the
[SPEAKER_00]: shop where they needed to buy their light
and everything else as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I started to grow from
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I grew from seed, then it went
really fast.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it went really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you think that having an
environment where clones are freely
[SPEAKER_02]: available does hamper people popping new
seeds and finding new genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of bottlenecks things?
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely makes that less seeds are
popped.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, of course people are lazy,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they think it's easier or they're
scared for germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people never grown from seed,
there's a bit scared for it as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see that with some of the Dutch
people that I know people that growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: many years and they've never germ to seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just scared of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, Oh no, I heard about you can
get a male or you can get a hermy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything can be full of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which they should not be, to be honest,
even though I always advise people if they
[SPEAKER_00]: do selections to do it separately from
your cash crops and your income type
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it raises an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about people who live in
say countries where cultivation is illegal
[SPEAKER_02]: and they don't want to pop new seeds
because they're too dependent on the money
[SPEAKER_02]: for their livelihood?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess in general, do you feel like
people should try to keep an external job
[SPEAKER_02]: to cannabis if they live in an illegal
country so that they have the freedom to
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment with their grow or it's okay to
be locked into that production mode?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's okay to be locked into
production mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, if you can spare one light,
yeah, that's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just pop seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in a little tent, yeah, with just one
light, you can just keep on popping seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: there in the corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you only have like one light,
yeah, then you're not the type that will
[SPEAKER_00]: keep moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you like diversity and it's for
your own smoke, oh, then I would always go
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just keep on popping seeds and you
get a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see all different kinds of things
because cannabis is so wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us have not seen a lot of things
that are there, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we just loop back to yourself again,
what was the first ever cross you made
[SPEAKER_02]: when you did start breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: My first crosses were with Jack Harrow,
Sage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the earlier things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jack Harrow is what I started with,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I started to play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just with regular seeds from
Sansi and just starting to incross them
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, not even crossing them out to
anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep making seeds every generation,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just playing around and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just learning it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was probably the first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And were you aware of kind of how good the
genetics around you were?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm assuming, you know, it's kind of
95.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had access to Sansi stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is often regarded as kind of the
golden period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you feel that way at the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think at the time, all I knew is
that that was the standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that time, I didn't think,
I mean, I popped other things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't like as well, yeah, in those years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I look back now, yeah, there's a
huge difference that everybody knows,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, since the law changed here and they
couldn't, were not allowed to grow for
[SPEAKER_00]: seed anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people lost a lot of genetics and
a lot of moms and stuff, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it all had to go underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why a lot of that changed,
which is a big pity, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the Dutch are very good at doing
these things, yeah, but if it becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: small and illegal and you lose moms and
stuff, which happens, yeah, then it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you feel was the ultimate
downfall of the Dutch breeding scene,
[SPEAKER_02]: given it was at the pinnacle at that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 98 when they changed that law.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really, that's the start of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, then people had to move all their
plants underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them kept them for a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them lost them really fast,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all police busts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they couldn't even say that,
of course, as well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to make a public
statement saying, oh yeah, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing illegal stuff and we got
busted, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they never told the people that it
changed, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess the question has to be
asked, do you feel like any of those
[SPEAKER_02]: really, really elusive old school clones
are still around or do you think they're
[SPEAKER_02]: all just gone now?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's definitely still some old
plants still alive, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I keep some of these, the old
Nettle cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep those for a long time already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a really old Hindu Kush cut,
which is like more than 30 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still keep a K2 cut, which is from late
90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's still some plants around that
kept the time and stuff, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're cared for by a little group or
cells, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things always need to be on multiple
places for it to survive longer times
[SPEAKER_00]: because everything goes wrong sometime,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to loop back, have a chat about
those Neville clones in a minute,
[SPEAKER_02]: but just to kind of keep the linearity of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you were doing your breeding and you
were kind of first starting out,
[SPEAKER_02]: was there anything else besides just that
allure of new variety which attracted you
[SPEAKER_02]: towards it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you kind of think, oh, you know what,
I think I could do probably a better job
[SPEAKER_02]: than what's been done thus far?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that didn't come till like a few years
ago, to be honest, that I thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm pretty okay at doing this,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That only came when huge numbers were
grown out in the States, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I saw the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can really see the difference
between those and some of other people's
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow bigger groups of all of them
next to each other, then you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was a bit more vigor, less phenyl
variation, things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you think to yourself,
you know what, I'm going to take this
[SPEAKER_02]: seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to pursue it full-time and I'm
going to make this my new gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I always was just breeding and I was
on the forums and stuff and it was all
[SPEAKER_00]: hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shared some seeds with some friends,
but I didn't want to sell anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I entered an ICMAC up because they
asked me and then the guy running that,
[SPEAKER_00]: he said to me, yeah, you got to sell
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you sell seeds to me, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of pushed me, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of started it, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's later like 2007 probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even 2007, 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, I never sold a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a lot of seeds and gave them away
and all my friends and we all grew them
[SPEAKER_00]: and people on the forums, I shared them
and things like that, but they were never
[SPEAKER_00]: sold before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was the first project that you
created that caused you to go down the
[SPEAKER_02]: rabbit hole and you kind of thought,
you know what, I might work this one a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Happy Brother, which is that old Hindu
Kush card.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a thing that was a, it was like a
clone only thing here, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, oh, this needs to be in
seed, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of my first like really
aimed project I did, which to be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my eyes was not the biggest success.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's not there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to restart the whole project
from zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting you bring that up because
I had some questions about that because
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually, I got the genetics in front
of me in terms of what you did with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy Brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to my surprise, you paired it with the
Chem D, which I like, I mean, that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: too surprising, but what I found
surprising was that like people in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past, you had felt that like the Hindus or
the Afghanis in general were a good match
[SPEAKER_02]: for the Chem Dog genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you still stand by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had to do it today, I'm probably
going to restart it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely use something
different, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will use an Afghani though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think an Afghani would be good,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like an Afghani Incross type of thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how would you describe the Happy
Brother clone in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at the time that was the strongest
tasting weed that I've ever smoked at that
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are some, a few things that went
over it, but at that time that was,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was extremely strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like really hard, small nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like really, really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of has a little bit of an OG type
structure in the butt, but it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very resinous, light green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very specific flavor as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I don't see in cannabis a lot,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's one that's just not
quite valued and has fallen by the wayside
[SPEAKER_02]: or it's just that unique?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think there's someone, must be a few
other people that still keep it as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, it is a very, it is pretty unique
plant from what I see today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what I've have seen myself coming
from seed from all kinds of sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've never grown certified Hindukush
land-raised seeds that are like a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent Hindukush land-raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is hard to find any certified
land-raised today, to be honest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no material for me to compare it
with on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you could just kind of click your
fingers and get access to any land-race
[SPEAKER_02]: you wanted, which one would you want to
work with the most?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably going to have to pick two and
that'd be Afghani and Thai.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever get to try any of the old
school Thai?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have a lot of Thai imports here
in the older day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I would definitely do Thai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thai is all about by the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Afghanis would all be about
their power.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I like the flavor of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of the strong flavors and
smells that people like in some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: strains are Afghani based.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so just Afghani in general,
or is there one specific you kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: gravitate towards?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because these days, it seems like we're
starting to see more diversity within
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanis and they're not just one group.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kind of subdivided into the
different regions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is any one region particularly calling out
to you or you're just happy with whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I do like... Well, I wouldn't go for a
specific region, but I do like the
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter, broad leaf type versions.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of the ones that speak
to me as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, perfect little segue question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about the history of OG
overall?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you kind of made the reference
earlier on that the Happy Brother reminded
[SPEAKER_02]: you a little bit of OG in some ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think's the backstory behind
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's... Well, all these years,
yeah, and all the stories and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's not much I can really say on
it that would be like genuine and
[SPEAKER_00]: certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I can say are things that I hear or
read or have been told.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think most of those things are
already like open in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do 100% think it's genuine that my
friend Josh was one that grew it the first
[SPEAKER_00]: in California and stuff and blew it up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it came from Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what happened before that,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it is, I don't know what it's
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Josh D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to follow this question up by
saying, you know, we've seen that the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole TK Origins crew is slowly coming out
of the woodworks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you tend to believe their story?
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember I spoke with Josh at the
Emerald Cup and he said, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's pretty sold on the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I have nothing to verify anything what
anyone says about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know Josh as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know anything before that kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you think we went from
having, let's just for argument's sake,
[SPEAKER_02]: say that the Josh D cut was the original
or the TK, the kind of very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say that's the original.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you think it went from there to the
point where we've got all the different OG
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that they were just like
crosses made with the original or it was
[SPEAKER_02]: just stuff locked within it and they were
kind of bag seed?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you think we got there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's multiple things happening
there at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is it did make like every pound would
have probably like four seeds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Josh and his crew and everybody grew
it in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those seeds would be germed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there were a lot of people when
the cut kind of was shared with other
[SPEAKER_00]: people and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People wanted to know like, this is my OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they all started to name it different
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where kind of the mess started,
to be honest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you had that people started
calling the bag seed the same thing as the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, the butt they found it in and not
labeling it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which you see a lot today as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, then it all gets like so messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because this is all like underground
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be hard to really find a
solid or like a hundred percent proven
[SPEAKER_00]: type of thing yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will always just be people saying
things now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you think that the idea,
at least when you look at some of these OG
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts, the common story I hear from people
and it's always like, I always get the
[SPEAKER_02]: impression that they're kind of a bit new
to the scene because they come up to me
[SPEAKER_02]: and they say it as if like I've never
heard it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're always like, Oh, OG is just
like lemon Paki crossed into, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hindu or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like that really typical
genetics, which is probably not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like that does explain why
some of the OG cuts are really lemony?
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet, you know, the Josh D cut,
it doesn't really have any lemon at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it was just locked inside
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, here's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will call some smells lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, other people say that's not lemon as
well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that when I give like weed and I
don't give some OG nuggets yet to a few
[SPEAKER_00]: different people, let them all smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people that almost never smelled
weed like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say it smells lemony while the other
ones that smoke OG say, Oh, this doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like a lemon yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's, it's pretty hard with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even on that part as well, there is lemon,
more lemony type OGs, more pine soul,
[SPEAKER_00]: more pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: More earthy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in different percentages,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all OG.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all in OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you start breathing with it or
when the seeds or as ones, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these percentages, it becomes way
more earthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes way more lemony or pine solely
or pine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the way it's grown also makes a clear
difference with OGs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if they're grown on soil,
if they're grown outdoor, which type of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients make a little difference as
well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things make the same clone come out
very different sometimes as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you give the same OG clone to 10
different growers and they all return it,
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be quite some differences a lot
of times in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like exactly the same
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't remember who said it,
but I think it might be might have even
[SPEAKER_02]: been Caleb from CSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forgive me if I'm wrong, but basically
someone told me something along the lines
[SPEAKER_02]: of like they rounded up all the different
OG cuts and grew them all out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was really only like two or
three different OGs across what was meant
[SPEAKER_02]: to be like 40 different cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just, as you said, just
different grow conditions, different
[SPEAKER_02]: noses, describing different flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you be happy to believe that that
could be true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a bit surprised though that on 40,
it would be only three different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have expected a little bit more,
but yeah, they're definitely multiple the
[SPEAKER_00]: same under different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you all collect all kinds of OG cuts
from everywhere, you'll definitely have
[SPEAKER_00]: the same clone under different names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I might be mistaken on some of the
finer details of that, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you got the point more or less
correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one of the things people say
to me is that the, the SFV cut,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak, people will call that a
myriad of different names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people have said to me that the Larry
is definitely different to the SFV.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a few others that are
definitely different, but you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of those other ones you hear about
with like a little bit more obscure that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all just really the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just like a lemon OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we would with Stuart, we grew
probably like seven or eight of the cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: like at the same time and they were
different.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're all a bit older type cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all straight OG, but they were
all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and then sometimes I think as
well, if a clone is like not kept right,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, um, it's too, in a too hard of a room
for a long time, all these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets like PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people call it genetic derivative,
but I don't think it, I don't call it
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic drift yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you keep that plant really well
for a year and you treat it really well,
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes back by itself as well.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an idea which has been kind of
expressed by a few of our guests in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you believe that there is a way to
rejuvenate the plant indoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause most of our past guests,
when they kind of echo that sentiment,
[SPEAKER_02]: you just expressed, they'd say,
Oh, you kind of got to get it outside,
[SPEAKER_02]: get it under the sun and that'll really
rejuvenate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find you're able to do it indoors,
just in a really well maintained
[SPEAKER_02]: environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I did it with all the old cuts I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go outdoor every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really reinvigorates it with that life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very rich soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, like a week before flower,
that's one take of a new cuts and then
[SPEAKER_00]: move them inside again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll loop back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the last question I wanted to just
quickly ask on the topic is, how do you
[SPEAKER_02]: feel about the rise of tissue culturing
and kind of the Mary stem culturing as a
[SPEAKER_02]: way of rejuvenating these plants and
getting them back to their former glory?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like it's something you'll
explore more or are you still just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: waiting to see how that technology pans
out a bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's the whole future.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works really well as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see the price point coming down to
the point where pretty much every old
[SPEAKER_02]: clone will be tissue cultured eventually,
or it's just those really select
[SPEAKER_02]: standouts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, I think there will be huge
genetic libraries made into tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more legally it becomes all over
the world, I think the whole future will
[SPEAKER_00]: be just that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you...
[SPEAKER_00]: If it would be legal in the whole world,
it would push away the big part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed market a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would sell a tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you would create and breed things,
but you would sell the tissue culture to
[SPEAKER_00]: people then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's definitely a future outcome,
which isn't really discussed as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but that's... I mean, you look at it
from a client's point, it's very logical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very logical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So... Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this brings us to the first big
question that I think people were waiting
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: When and how was it that you came about to
decide that the Hell's OG was the OG that
[SPEAKER_02]: you wanted to work with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those cuts, I got in, let me think,
must be 2008, 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that as a V.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the SFV died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this was the only original,
well, one of the older OG cuts from the US
[SPEAKER_00]: I had at that time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest I had was all from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that was one of the reasons to be
honest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apart from that, I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a serious kick to it compared to
some of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as light green as most of the
OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cut itself doesn't show much purple,
but the gene pool definitely has quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of purple in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cut that I got did have some PTSD
problems and not that much vigor and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took almost three years before it
really came back to good power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, seeds are always a good thing
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, limited availability can often be
the reason for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned there's not a lot of purple
in the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's amazing you mentioned that
because I had a question specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: about that where I was saying a lot of the
biker or the Hells OG lines that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: worked, they tend to be pretty green.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a lot of purple in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of like a bit of a
polarizing thing for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people see purple and they just put
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think it's weak, can't be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you tend to fall into that same camp or
do you think, no, it's just purely a
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the strongest weeds that
I've smoked were not purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is definitely weaker purple
things, just as there is weaker green
[SPEAKER_00]: things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, there's some strong purple type
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even the cookie type gene pool and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not that's not weak weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's stronger, much stronger stuff,
but it's not weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then there's some other strains which I
think are pretty weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand why people have that
thought or say things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't think it's that easy or you
can put it over like that easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely strong purple weed as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to quickly loop back to the Hells
OG, if you weren't able to work with the
[SPEAKER_02]: Hells Angels OG and you were still limited
by that selection you had, which OG would
[SPEAKER_02]: you have opted to work with next in line?
[SPEAKER_00]: The OG JG cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the, some people call it juggles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a rare one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't hear about that outside of the
DNA crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cut comes from a friend of mine at
BB.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Cali Cush Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the originators of, they have
that cut since the old days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has that name because when a kid in
their crew, when he grew it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a Jewish kid.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it was word gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he just grew it the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it was called that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the little kids, they called him
the Jew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was the Jews gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's called that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not negative at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a very flavorful, very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It yields really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like for me, that's an all
rounded OG that I personally like,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably like the most of all the older OG
cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've spoken to many people about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, the first kind of point of
view I heard expressed about it was that
[SPEAKER_02]: some people kind of doubted it existed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in the sense that no one disputes
kosher is a good strain, unquestionable.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, when I was asking some people
about the Jew gold, they were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You never really saw photos of it or
anything until well after kosher was out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people had even thought,
well, maybe, maybe, you know, the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the original is, was produced just to
explain where things came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it is a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know the background before
much before that, to be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they'd been growing that for a fucking
long time yet way before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, DNA entered it, um, and then made the
kosher cush sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way before that, that cuts had been grown
a long time before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked it way before they entered it as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you feel about the DNA crew?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're quite polarizing in many people's
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no problem with DNA, even though
like this kosher thing, there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of, I don't know,
those are not things that I, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't like to go into those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know all the backstories and everything
that really happened and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't like talking about that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about some of the more blatant kind
of, uh, questionable breeding practices
[SPEAKER_02]: that have occurred?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, we've had guests on in
the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such as Brie de Steve, who have had their
issues with Barney's farm, given the,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they're blatantly ripping off
one of his strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about those situations
where it's a little more clear cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just be honest about it then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: About almost the whole Dutch thing and
what these companies do kind of these days
[SPEAKER_00]: and what a lot of them kind of are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll find something from someone and
then just make it theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's the same with the kosher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kosher thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought that wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They entered it, um, and then made the
fucking strain out of it is that then then
[SPEAKER_00]: called it that they didn't even have to
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how those things go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then yeah, Barney's there's loads of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like even like to call the names
because then I'm like pointing at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they all do this type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been doing that for many
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these things are not bred by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll find someone like you or someone
else or like me or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you showed him something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly not a point of view we're
hearing for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have said things along
this line, but it's nice to get
[SPEAKER_02]: clarification from someone who's so,
you know, kind of connected with that
[SPEAKER_02]: scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm, I'm connected in, like I said,
I'm in, in, in all these different,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, lines in, in the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I'm still connected to everyone in
the down market, uh, in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I'm also connected to people that
are standing in the spotlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and all of these people love cannabis
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that I think, um, the commercial
and then the pressure, uh, and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, made it go that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also have to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you have to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeans don't fall from the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you always have to get it somewhere or
from someone as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess my next question is,
it's a little different, but I'd love to
[SPEAKER_02]: get your perspective on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did the Dutch scene react to when
Cookies first came out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it kind of, you know, it took over
a lot of scenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the same case in Holland?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, um, the first time Cookies came here
is when Jigga came over here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know which year it is,
2013 or 2012 or 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of these years of the high times
copy came here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when he showed people, a lot of the
people that didn't have, that didn't go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the U S had not seen it before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when he was away that same year,
you had a Girl Scout Cookies on menus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was not Girl Scout Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it took like probably three
years, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the Girl Scout Cookie form cut kind
of went to Europe and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you started seeing it, but it's more
like in the still in the underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like smaller growers and the form
people these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get by Cookies these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many Dutch people grow it though,
but they don't like it because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: yield enough for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used to growing amnesia,
which yields a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very easy to grow no matter what
you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feed it too much, it doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they will grow amnesia here.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about the fabled core cut
of amnesia?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a staple for you or it's just a bit
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny thing that it's labeled core cut
these days, but, um, yeah, so that's a cut
[SPEAKER_00]: that went from sweep, which is the owner
of high pro, which is kind of the base of
[SPEAKER_00]: that amnesia gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, from other to other people and then
into the forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then core was a member of the forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sent it out to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's labeled core cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a high pro amnesia cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two or three of them around in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's kind of what the staple is for
amnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few that are a little bit
better, but they flower a bit longer or
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just kind of that nice balance of
all things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not my favorite weed,
me personally, yeah, but, um, it's easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take a lot of abuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a high TSC percentage.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it breathes pretty nice as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's a good overall clone and
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we jump back to your own breeding
for a moment, it seems to me like your
[SPEAKER_02]: first major cross that kind of started to
get you widespread attention was the biker
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you agree with this analysis and how
did you feel when it initially took off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think OG is definitely the thing
that made me noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the reason was at that time,
yeah, when that came out, almost every OGC
[SPEAKER_00]: that came out, no matter if they were
regular or whatever, they had like a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of herm problems.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this line had way less.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just a small percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think that's the thing that got
noticed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you feel like crossing OG with
things?
[SPEAKER_02]: There is an intrinsic risk with it because
there's this debate which surrounds OG and
[SPEAKER_02]: how it's a little bit Hermey prone and
people often give the example of,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, you should never cross Girl Scouts
and OG together because it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: guaranteed to get your Hermes.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel like about that idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like it's intrinsic and
inevitable that you're going to get some
[SPEAKER_02]: Hermes with OG?
[SPEAKER_02]: And would you ever cross it to Girl
Scouts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, the Girl Scout gene pool,
if you take one of those old cards,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're way more terrible for Herm type
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry pie is even worse than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think if you clean up an OG line,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning if you do like back crosses and
in-crosses and every time you select away
[SPEAKER_00]: from it, um, you can lower the percentage.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, OG is not as bad as, um, some of the
chem and the sour gene pool were in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, at start.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Girl Scout cookie, cherry pie,
those two are like, I haven't been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: get those really clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't like to work too much with
those two lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh geez.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm, I'm very confident these days
with my own lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I dare to cross it with all kinds
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'm not worried about Herms coming
from that side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what, what would be the big,
no-no for you in terms of crossing
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would it be OG and cherry pie?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, I mean, I did headstache,
which is Girl Scout cookie, cherry pie and
[SPEAKER_00]: OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only line I have not been
able to clean.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, no, I don't, I, I try to
stay away these days from the Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie, cherry pie, um, things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's just say that you didn't create
the biker OG line, which out of your own
[SPEAKER_02]: creations would have been next in line for
you to consider working forward or using
[SPEAKER_02]: as kind of a line you wanted to represent
yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that definitely would be the
headbanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the strain that's became most
popular from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that was all because everybody
wants sour D.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which is normal because I think it was
some of the best weed in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, it's kind of the headbanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then that's kind of what I did now
with like the back crosses to that sour D
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I did, so that's what people always
asked for kind of, but I didn't ever did
[SPEAKER_00]: it before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you feel like sour D just
totally overtook the OG craze when it came
[SPEAKER_02]: about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, um, OG is way easier to grow
than, than, than sour D is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour D is not easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of people won't have the big
success right away with it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, it needs a different feeding
than most other plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's certainly one of the more
unique ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you feel about the history?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's almost got a more
disputed history than OG itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's like even a bigger mess than,
than the OG background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've been so interested in trying to
find that out for so many years at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even care that much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people really care when they
don't have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have it, that's kind of the most
important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even though you would still like to
know what it is, it's less important than
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can, I can certainly agree with
that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good one to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting because as I'm sure
you're probably well aware, there's a,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a bit of drama that surrounds your
sour D clone because it specifically comes
[SPEAKER_02]: from a rez dog release, which kind of adds
a extra layer of complexity to the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about working with,
you know, people's gear who other people
[SPEAKER_02]: may not jive with or be as willing to work
with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in this case, I understand a hundred
percent, which is one of the reasons I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't backcross it before either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's why I even try not to call
out his name too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this plant is so special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant is so fucking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people just deserve this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they see just need to go fucking
everywhere and then everybody needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody needs to have smoked this at
least once in their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's just that so good of a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had to pick one thing that I could
bring to me, um, to an island,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would bring that a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how many seeds did you pop when you
initially found this clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: I popped two packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that goes to show all you need is
one or two packs and you can find
[SPEAKER_02]: something really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, you know, definitely,
definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those seeds then, um, I mean,
this is very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get lucky sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got really lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why did I get lucky?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lucky because this plant did not
herm and it's offspring doesn't herm
[SPEAKER_00]: almost either.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is very rare for all those seeds
from res and from those days.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they were pretty messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, Hey, she knows there were
herms in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was just messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there was some like diamonds in
there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my cut comes from the same badge that
another cut that's around in Europe comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from, which is the Riri cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's from exact same seed batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the first time he released his
sour D IBL, which is not an IBL by the
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should not have been labeled to IBL,
but, um, yeah, that's 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught them in 2007.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like people tend to view Rez's
work with kind of rose shaded glasses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of people acknowledge the
controversy surrounding him, but at the
[SPEAKER_02]: same time, a lot of people won't deny that
the gear was really good, or at least so
[SPEAKER_02]: it said, do you feel like people gloss
over the fact, like what you just
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned that there were a lot of herms
and a lot of junk in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think for that time, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those genes were not spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When things go into seed, they go over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so just for people seeing that for the
first time, you had the good things that
[SPEAKER_00]: were in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just made it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The time and being the first with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just made it to what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he was not a nice guy on the forums
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not before all the snitch problem and all
this other stuff happened either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was not a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always was fucking cursing at people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People on the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was not a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well we've seen him pop his head back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was probably about a year or more ago
now on Instagram and they quickly kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: ducked out again just to play devil's
advocate.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you feel if say res dog came
back and he bought five or 10 packs of
[SPEAKER_02]: your sour DBX two and wanted to work that
forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you see that as an honor or an
insult?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, you got to see that as an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that means he fucking admits that I
did it better than he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though I started with his stuff,
I cleaned it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no her almost no her minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it breeds, um, if you pop these back
across two seats, if you look on my
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, there's so many people I had
had them grow out before they were even
[SPEAKER_00]: released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every female is sour D.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's, there's a variation in that,
of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but they all have that smell and that
stink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and most of them have the high,
which it's very important about it as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, if you pop two of these pack
of seats, you'll definitely get a better
[SPEAKER_00]: choice of what you want to keep compared
to what it was then.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I definitely wanted to make the
point of complimenting you on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I look at those photos, that
absolutely unmistakable, undeniable,
[SPEAKER_02]: that, uh, very swollen Calyx look that the
sour D has all the females I've seen from
[SPEAKER_02]: your, uh, BX two, they've got that look.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of on initial glance,
I'm like, is that the clone?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, but then you're like,
Oh, well, it's the BX two.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, yeah, you did an amazing job on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came out really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the back cross one I didn't release,
um, that was kind of iffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that was not good enough to be sold as
a seed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were quite a lot of weaker plans in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I think the headbanger male I
used, um, probably was not the best pick.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably why that's what I started
it off with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then from the back cross one,
I found some really good males here and I
[SPEAKER_00]: used multiple males as well in this back
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you feel is the proper breeding
etiquette for using someone else's work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you kind of think that if you bought
it, you don't really owe them anything or
[SPEAKER_02]: how do you like to deal with other
breeders when you're using some of their
[SPEAKER_02]: work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what I did here is normally wrong.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, yeah, I think it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you buy seeds, this is all about
commercial sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do whatever you do for yourself,
your friends and trading, that's a totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if you buy someone seed,
um, you don't in cross them, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then sell them like a pure version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's kind of a no-go thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but out crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you buy those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you buy my seeds, cross it with
whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that's of course, and you can sell
it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't matter at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want people to do that,
then you shouldn't sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you like to, if it's,
it's at all possible kind of open lines of
[SPEAKER_02]: communication with someone, if you were
going to use some of their work or you
[SPEAKER_02]: just tend to use it and do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, apart from this sour D thing,
cause I didn't talk to res dog about that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all my other things like co-ops or
other things, they were all like in
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement with these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most times they give me this stuff to do
that with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you look at our OG Horty lab gives me
that card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very good friends with camaraderie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gives me stuff to do things with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it the same the other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, I share a lot with a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a lot of people that have seed
companies and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I share stuff with them, which is not
for my own work as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, I have a very big, um,
genetic seed stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I shared stuff from that through the
years with a lot of people online and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, a lot of people made things with it,
uh, started lines with it and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's interesting that you bring up the
sour power because I think it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's an interesting strain for mostly one
reason, but it's probably more.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about undisclosed genetics
and would you ever release across where
[SPEAKER_02]: you didn't release the genetic information
around it?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, if I know it, then I'll always tell
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because with how things are,
you sometimes don't even know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you feel like with Horty labs,
they truly didn't know what the,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, the star bud was, or do you think that
that was a bit of a marketing ploy?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think you really don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other question about them,
I wanted to quickly ask was I had heard
[SPEAKER_02]: some whispers saying that, Oh,
Dave Watson, a skunk man, Sam is the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the mastermind behind Horty labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know if that's true or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I know the guy behind Horty lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not, David Watson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows him though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he knows him though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he knows them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, David is in, is in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Horty used to be in Amsterdam a lot as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they have an acquaintance,
you know, so yeah, no, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they must have met each other a
couple of times, but he's definitely not
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the sour power.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh gee, your, your work with the sour
power is a lime, which definitely gets a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, the photos on your Instagram,
they're gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about that cross of yours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it one of your ones that you're more
kind of proud to put forward?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you feel like there's kind of other
ones that you'd be more looking to get
[SPEAKER_02]: people to grow if they had a choice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think flavors are always very
personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like sour D most of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I kind of always pick something
that has, so I mean the sour power OG has
[SPEAKER_00]: sour in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a head banger is way more like a sour
D type hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would prefer personally to smoke
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when it comes to growing sour power,
OG is very sturdy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's very easy, very resinous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks beautiful as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's pretty powerful as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so a lot of people find things in it
they keep and they can produce.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if we just jumped back to bike a cush
for a moment, I noticed in an Instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: thread, you said that the initial mail you
used on the Hells OG was an SFV BX2 that
[SPEAKER_02]: you actually got from Swerve's gear.
[SPEAKER_02]: Swerve's a guy who gets a bit of flack
from some people in the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd be interested to hear what's your
opinions on the Cali con and Swerve's gear
[SPEAKER_02]: in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me say I got those seeds from
Captain Cribb.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but Swerve said he makes them,
um, those two people used to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever it is, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as for Swerve, um, I know him as a
person, um, he may have made some mistakes
[SPEAKER_00]: here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know when it comes to,
when it comes to the breeding or how he
[SPEAKER_00]: runs his business or how he named some of
his strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a very different philosophy on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how I do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never cross, uh, call across the
name of the clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause when the people grow them out
after that, yeah, everybody starts to call
[SPEAKER_00]: it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where all this mess comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in Europe, there are so many people
to say, I have SFV OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, uh, uh, Larry OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this Larry OG is Larry OG times
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, I have different views on
things and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's definitely not a bad guy at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a person, he's a really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're thinking about OG in
general, I kind of already asked this
[SPEAKER_02]: question in relation to happy brother,
but in specifically for OG, what in your
[SPEAKER_02]: mind is the perfect partner for an OG
cross?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think OG does not cross well with,
um, like very sativa type things like the
[SPEAKER_00]: real phases and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that crosses well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what I think crosses well with OGs or,
um, to be honest, kind of tighter butter
[SPEAKER_00]: type things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, um, that was a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like OGs, cams and sours, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are all kind of pretty maybe even
related.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those things all mixed with each other
pretty well as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes yields go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it does keep the flavour kind of pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not the biggest fan of crossing
them out to like fruity things and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like most times it weakens
both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would tend to agree that the,
the cam and the OG do tend to blend pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: well together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what a perfect segue in terms of
talking about that collab you did with JJ
[SPEAKER_02]: from Top Dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you find the road dog came out and
did that stimulate you to want to look
[SPEAKER_02]: into the cam genetics a bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like cam genetics a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I prefer cam 91, um, probably most
because probably because it's more gassy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think cam D is one of the strongest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that Stardog that I use, that's from
one of his earlier releases as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, at the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's the own selected cut as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I liked, I liked the outcome of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's very gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the only problem with that line is,
and with, I think with some, most of these
[SPEAKER_00]: camps, yeah, is they don't have that long
of a shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make a lot of flour of it and
you keep it for three, four months,
[SPEAKER_00]: it tends to like get a darker tint and
stuff like that faster than a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of like to smoke it a bit fresh
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke it three, four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: After it comes down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most certainly I can attest to the more
fresher stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just being so punch in your face strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that comment being said though,
what strains do you think have a good
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf life and that longevity within the
flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's with the hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they, they, they're really good at
like, they're even better after six
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you take them out of the bag or out
of your jar after two years, they are
[SPEAKER_00]: still a hundred percent dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour D does really well as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can jar that up for a long time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, um, it was in fact, AJ,
who put a post up yesterday of some six
[SPEAKER_02]: month old, uh, sour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was saying, yeah, it definitely
tastes better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer sativa type things are more
sativa genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to cure better for long-term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the same with OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like my OGs to be smoked within six
months after hardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've sadly never had the
production capacity or patience to wait
[SPEAKER_02]: that long to smoke any stuff I've grown,
but I've got a new benchmark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see with most like tight Indica
type buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they are kind of better smoked a bit
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the hazes, uh, they, they,
they are kind of better if they've laid
[SPEAKER_00]: like at least three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in general, what are some of the
other strains you find that are best fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: off the bat, you know, just a few weeks
after coming down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think like, um, these more fruity
type things, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that people like a lot these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That type of stuff doesn't cure well for
long-term as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which is also kind of why the live
residents and everything of them are way
[SPEAKER_00]: better than they're cured residents of
those type of plants a lot of times as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can definitely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the live resin from some of the
fruity stuff is off the chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to jump back to, uh, some of the
collaborations you've done before,
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed you've done a plethora of
collabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of all the ones you've done,
what were you most surprised with?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I shouldn't say surprised,
but which one were you most pleasantly
[SPEAKER_02]: surprised to see the end outcome?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like which one was just really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you always, you always go into
something thinking it's going to be a good
[SPEAKER_02]: outcome, but you were just blown away by
the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like a lot where the camaraderie or
OG came out as even though it's OG and I
[SPEAKER_00]: already had a lot of OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just liked that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, apart from that, something which is
not that known yet is, um, African dream,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is JJ's Nigerian Hayes times white a
five that came out like, wow, was well,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that, that's a really diverse mix
of genetics in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the, the sativa African with the,
uh, the a five white.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's gotta be special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're very sativish style in
grow and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll be mostly 12, 14 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only for the truly committed sativa
heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to grow real Hayes is you,
you got to, you got to be accepting to go
[SPEAKER_00]: between 12 and 16 to 17 weeks sometimes
even.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this kind of brings us to one of the
questions I've been most excited to ask
[SPEAKER_02]: you about going into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little birdie told me that you have some
projects in the works with Bodie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you be able to elaborate a little
more on that for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't know that much about it yet to
be really honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my friend is setting that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't, that's not fully worked out
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, there's not much I can say yet to be
really honest.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your bird flies fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bird flies really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got little birds everywhere,
but, but, um, the question I'd love to ask
[SPEAKER_02]: then is in, in your kind of dream
situation, what types of things would you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to bring to the table and what types
of things do you think that he has that
[SPEAKER_02]: would be cool if he was bringing that side
of the cross to the table?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'd love to have, um, some involvement
with his Nepali gene pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I put.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what would come from me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, knowing him and what interests him,
I think it would be, uh, the hazes though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what probably I have that
probably interests him the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, oh geez, or, and sour he,
he has it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think he would prefer those gene
pools more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause he did the band-aid haze,
which, um, was done with the a five tie
[SPEAKER_00]: those seeds I sent all over the world
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think it would be like probably
that gene pool, a five C five,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, those hazes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So funnily enough, this is a good,
so I heard from a different little birdie
[SPEAKER_02]: that, and you referenced it before the,
uh, you might have access to some of
[SPEAKER_02]: Neville's original breeder cuts,
like the C five and the a five,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this true and what plans do you have
with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've in the early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I used to make a lot of clones of all
these plans for that group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've been kind of part of that
Southern, which is where I live as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in South Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I've been connected to this group
since I was really young.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and they're the crew who kind of
safeguard the C five and the a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they worked with Neville's as well
when he was here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess the thing, which maybe a lot of
people might be interested to hear is that
[SPEAKER_02]: like a lot of these breeder cuts do still
exist, which I was surprised to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: myself initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these cuts are, um, well, some people
call them breeder cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they, they come out of his breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a C five is, is, uh, is the NL five
times the, uh, hay's mill C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the a five is NL five times the hay's
mill A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's not just even one cut yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more cuts of it as well when that
selection was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most people only know one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then there's HBH, which is the hash
plant Hayes, um, the AG 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a couple more even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like for instance, the a five is what
most people are interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there were five cuts of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they are labeled one to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, number five being the most sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the number two is what some called the
diesel cut, which is the cut I work with
[SPEAKER_00]: the cut that I gave to Sandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which is went out a little bit to some
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's the number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the number four is still around as
well, but that never got grown that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way more hazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel like these are really kind
of the benchmark to try to aim for with
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think they're just impressive
for when they were produced, given it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, 30 years ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, those cuts are very, very special
still a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a combination with the NL
five, uh, and those Hayes that really
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like the, that Hayes pure from those
days, um, kind of tickles me way less than
[SPEAKER_00]: these two plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five is the really special one to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember, I was lucky enough to try some
of the C five when I was hanging out with
[SPEAKER_02]: Bodhi and he too said that, um,
a lot of people think that a five is a
[SPEAKER_02]: little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A five is very strong weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's the type of weed you kind of
need to smoke quite a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can get to a level you don't
get with other weeds these days at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a lot about, uh, how it works is we,
yeah, how it makes you feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very important with that weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like the C five, if you smoke a lot of
that, you won't almost won't be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you won't be sleeping well at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some people get very paranoid of the C
five as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's also people that only smoke Indy
cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you let them smoke a five, they'll be
like blathered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what happened to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be like out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sometimes when I go to like one of
these coffee shops here, then I'll bring
[SPEAKER_00]: some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all they smoke is amnesia and OG
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you let them smoke like two or three
joints of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they were all like flat out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes them feel so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not used to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the sample I got to smoke,
it was actually seeded.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably nowhere near as potent as
the sensei, but that C five, I can totally
[SPEAKER_02]: agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so uplifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so uplifting and stimulating that
like paranoia was the next logical step.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you kept smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got the, this got the bandaid
hay seven, which Bodie bread, the line
[SPEAKER_00]: then Doc selected that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've smoked a couple of hundred grams
of that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's, that got a really good high as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's comparable to like a C a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is on that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really nice plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did that one really, really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Doc and Bodie.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, that's another really good one,
which I don't think is on the radar of
[SPEAKER_02]: enough people, but just to jump back to
where we all started this question,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was in regards to kind of Neville,
where do you think Neville rates in terms
[SPEAKER_02]: of the, the great breeders throughout the
Dutch history and, and of all the breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout history, who has had the
greatest influence in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you really look at all the work
that people done, he, I mean, he did,
[SPEAKER_00]: he did quite some work with his very early
days as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just him and a few other people as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the seeds that go out and
get sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so those plants are very special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is very knowledgeable on it as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I think like, uh, Simon from Syria
seeds, that guy has been doing it way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy really did a lot and um,
still does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, he, he's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, someone that most people don't even
think or know about anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Casey Brains did some nice things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a, there's a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those people are not that known
yet because they're not the ones out there
[SPEAKER_00]: or doing the seed company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Casey Brains is a very interesting one
because he's famous for never releasing
[SPEAKER_02]: any of the information around his
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in some instances he says himself,
he doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in other instances, I think it was
just also the way he named his strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about his strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think earlier on, you mentioned that
you've got a special K2 clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that come from him?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, that's not, that's not from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, his, his strains, um, even though
some of them have quite a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, his seeds from what I've seen,
it's been a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had new ones of it, so I'm going to
germ them all, see if they're still the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, he says he's still using his old
moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they had some very fruity,
interesting flavors in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like all the fruit things,
it's definitely a really nice source for
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of different things,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he used a lot of, um, Brazilian and
Afghani genes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Brazilian is one which doesn't really
get explored outside of his work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there might be something in
there that we're just brushing over and
[SPEAKER_02]: missing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of Brazilian friends here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I think that's why I'm doing
this project with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm popping all those seeds with them
because they know all the old Brazilian
[SPEAKER_00]: things that were around.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, they, they definitely say there,
there has been a lot of lime and melons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those type of, uh, terrapins,
uh, and smells that they were there like
[SPEAKER_00]: long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think most people, at least when
I talk to them, the only real exposure
[SPEAKER_02]: they have to the Brazilian genetics is
that mango B shape from B.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, you know, maybe
sometimes it gives things a bad rap,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how do you feel some of these
genetics would go if put in people's grow
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think people would give them a
second chance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they're still not quite refined to the
poly hybrid level we're used to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think some of Casey Brains ones
definitely could be like being commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: produced for today's market and being like
really wanted by the people that smoke it
[SPEAKER_00]: afterwards as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's very open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I just opened a little hole for
everybody to find a little lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everybody wants all these,
um, fruity type flavors and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this guy definitely has a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So getting back to a point I've been
bringing up in recent interviews,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you see this as a way to reinvigorate
modern genetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a common complaint is that we've
worked ourselves into kind of like this
[SPEAKER_02]: dead end poly hybrid type of thing where
there's this same, same quality amongst a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that we need to go back to
basics to some of these land races or just
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these more unworked lines and
generate new hybrids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, definitely, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think a lot of people have,
it all depends with the goal you're making
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most people that do it today or
start today, they make those seeds to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they look at what the market wants
or that's easy for them to sell,
[SPEAKER_00]: sell you and they get noticed for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they all cross it with cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which kind of takes away their personal
creativity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for me, a breeder is like artists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a painter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, if everybody starts to make
similar paintings, it kind of gets boring
[SPEAKER_00]: very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think today's gene pool and the seeds
that are on the market, there are so many
[SPEAKER_00]: of the similar type things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because everybody just takes
all the cuts that are shared, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then pollinates it with something
that's just been released for a year or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you just get everything crossed
with each other now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, I definitely think it's good
for people to, or seek a goal in like a
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes or whatever you want to make
lemon and find as much different lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter what it is, what the name
is or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then start searching in that yourself.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same for all kind of other terpenes or
other things you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make a haze, try and find
as much different haze genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, as genuine as you can German mole,
forget all the names and just pick what
[SPEAKER_00]: you like and start from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you, would you actually do that
yourself in terms of say like popping like
[SPEAKER_02]: a hundred seeds, just losing all the name
tags and just seeing what came out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I'd love to do it to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been as bold to really do it in
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always put the tags in though,
but yeah, that's kind of, that's the best
[SPEAKER_00]: way to be really honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you should just put a number on
everything, write it on a paper,
[SPEAKER_00]: lock it up, do the whole grow,
do your selection, pick what you like
[SPEAKER_00]: most, and then look what you, what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the fairest and the honest
thing to do as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all get influenced otherwise.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, names can have a really powerful
effect on the way people perceive them.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about the whole Candy Rain
situation from Cookie Fam?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like they really dropped the
ball on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they definitely dropped the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a fact to be really honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, I'm not scared of germinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I call it messy genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I'm not scared of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll germ to bite a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kill all the intersex or whatever and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not scared for those things,
but, um, those seeds clearly were not even
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise this could never happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that, it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, everybody knows I'm like very
strict on everything needs to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot just make seeds and start
selling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, for me, that's like not even
possible to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though in today's market,
that's like probably more than 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can't pay to be tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you feel in general about the
price that was charged for those seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether they had issues or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like it's an ever-growing
precedent for there to be these premium
[SPEAKER_02]: price seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you think it was just a bit absurd?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think it's absurd.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look what I sold the Sour D,
Bekros too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have sold those for whatever I
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would have bought them right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sell them for a price that I think is
like almost the max of what seeds should
[SPEAKER_00]: be costing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think seeds should be going above
$150.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that should be kind of a cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though that has changed totally
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I personally prefer not to sell
anything above that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think that there should be kind
of like, I don't want to use the term,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's nothing else that would fit as
well, but kind of like a union for
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding seeders where like you agree on
like price ceilings and price floors and
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of like structure among seed pricing,
like an F2 you can charge this much and F1
[SPEAKER_02]: you can only charge this much.
[SPEAKER_02]: How would you feel about that concept?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it's got to be a free market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, every other product is a free
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy sunglasses for a Euro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy sunglasses for a thousand
Euro.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that, no, I don't think that
should be a standard rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think seeds are worth that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should, if you take a lot of time
breeding something, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it for once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or only sell two or 300 packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to do that for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need to ask $500 or $400 to
$300 for a package of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then these day, all they do is like,
oh, this is limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will never be there anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are very rare, all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that it should be expensive for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not the way it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only thing that can be more expensive or
seeds that are harder to make,
[SPEAKER_00]: take longer to make things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or that took a lot of money to make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of breeding steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, then it needs to be a bit more
expensive to recoup your investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that certainly makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on a slightly related topic,
I noticed on your IG that some of your new
[SPEAKER_02]: seed packaging, the pack I noticed
specifically was the Guava Gelato Cross
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds amazing, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I noticed on it that it said premium
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got me thinking about this idea of
like breeders having different tiers of
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics, like a premium line where like
kind of like more work had gone into it,
[SPEAKER_02]: or just kind of like more of like a
quicker project, but it was still ready
[SPEAKER_02]: for market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think you'd ever look into
something like this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always try to like classify some of the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I do a lot of things that they're not
normally not sold or released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then sometimes once a year,
I'll bring them out to like a spanner base
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll call those exclusives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will only like sell like 10,
20 packs or whatever, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But normally I'll breed a line and I
intend to sell it for many years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spend a couple of years to make them
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I think it's very reasonable to ask
like 100 euros for those seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just to clarify, I'm 100% in favor
of the free market approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a question which I get drilled by the
fans if I don't ask it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And heck, I'm interested as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What traits do you look for when you're
trying to find a good breeding male?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me start here then.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be able to pick a good male
out of a gene pool, you have to grow that
[SPEAKER_00]: gene pool first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot have a gene pool that you
have never grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get these Afghani seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never grown these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds that I have in my hand now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may have grown Afghanis, but that
doesn't count.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll pop these seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to grow quite a lot of those before
I really know the percentages of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that pops up, how common it is,
all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a relationship with that gene
pool then as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you recognize things even without being
able exactly to say, Oh, it's because of
[SPEAKER_00]: these leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you grow them, you know that
family.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have that before you can
really select the male and predict all the
[SPEAKER_00]: traits that it's going to give.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to make your chances way
bigger of picking the right male easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course there is the stem rub,
the structure, all these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always say we're breeding and selecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing is killing a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't start by picking the best thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you start by taking everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's weaker structure,
not strong against illnesses, all these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you're left over,
that's where you're going to pick it from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so are there any particular techniques
or traits that you're specifically looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, a really common one we get
told on the show is the old faithful stem
[SPEAKER_02]: rub.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a fan of the stem rub?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always do the stem rub as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good trick we use works with a lot
of lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when you've grown everything before,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, the females, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The females you like the most,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you write down the day exactly on when
it started to throw pistols, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you look at all the males,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look which one is closest to the
same day starting at sex, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you compare all the leaves shapes
as well between these females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can kind of pick a male,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which has similar genes to that female,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by picking the day that it started to
flower, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, have you ever
considered or done a male reversal before
[SPEAKER_02]: where you, you know, turn it into the
female so you can smell the smells and
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the structure and whatnot?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I haven't yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very interested in doing that,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it would be mostly for smelling
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel like that there would be a
good chance that that smell would
[SPEAKER_02]: correlate to like what the male is
smelling?
[SPEAKER_02]: What the male is actually passing on?
[SPEAKER_00]: If when you grew that gene pool and you
grew all those seeds before and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen that smell being a higher percentage
in that group, yes, then yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then you can almost, you have a big
chance that it's a dominant trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, while we're on the breeder
topic in general, I mean, you could
[SPEAKER_02]: probably say that about the whole
interview, but in just relation to that
[SPEAKER_02]: candy rain situation we mentioned a few
minutes ago, what do you think is a
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder's responsibility in regards to
seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like it's, you know,
the breeder's responsibility to replace
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds that have poor results or do you
feel like their obligation ends at the
[SPEAKER_02]: wholesaler?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that if you release seeds
and you tested them and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you know what's not wrong with them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if then someone comes and says,
Oh, everything herms or everything does
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's not right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, that person did something
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can do something wrong and that
everything herms by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if everything herms, there's a problem
with those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that simple?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, just to really play the
devil's advocate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone comes to you and says,
Oh, you know, I grew out a pack of your
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and I had one herm out of 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not real happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you try to explain that that's like
a possibility or would you just be more
[SPEAKER_02]: inclined to just try to make the problem
go away, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I would definitely say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I tried to find out why first year
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if it's something to do with the way
it was grown or he triggered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's nice for him to know as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then it won't happen in the future
when it's like one herm in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it comes with the territory as well
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but if people are unhappy,
I always give them seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, that's not even a
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I think it's right, if one plant
herms in a pack, like for instance,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a cookie or think hybrid,
now that's to be expected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people won't complain even about it
when it's those, those gene pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause people know it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have the same when I pull up
someone else's seats, it doesn't matter if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's two or three herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never complain about it to be
honest personally.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly feel like it's, it's part of
the territory a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a topic I really wanted to ask you
about is just in general, the concept of
[SPEAKER_02]: Cali import.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel this affects local
markets?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I mean in the UK and in Holland,
I'm sure that there's plenty of Cali
[SPEAKER_02]: import.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like it hurts local producers
or it's too simplistic to view it like
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was at the spandibus this year and
what I've seen is that the higher quality
[SPEAKER_00]: local grown, yeah, that price went way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason that went so up so
high is because that import wheat that was
[SPEAKER_00]: there before, yeah, because that's so
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of changed the market price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think if local growers grow really
good wheat, they get more money for their
[SPEAKER_00]: wheat because that import was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that changed the market prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you feel about the hype
strains in general?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like it's a good or a bad
thing that certain strains just get these
[SPEAKER_02]: mind boggling mass followings?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's, that's just, it's like
fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times it's not the best wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the best flavor or things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be decent for it to become a
hype though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, some things just look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a purple punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care for it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to think about a lot of
things that get hyped is by the younger
[SPEAKER_00]: people as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have they seen before?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the knowledge they have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can only learn from the things that
they see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only thing they've seen is that OG,
that gelato and that cookie, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: better than the local swag or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I understand that that's,
that's gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we're on the topic of hype
strains, it feels like GMO and even Mac
[SPEAKER_02]: have kind of had their time in the
spotlight.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your prediction for the next strain
that's going to take the international
[SPEAKER_02]: stage by storm?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Skittles and the Papaya are
doing really well on that scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: When about something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like a fashion or like a music
number one hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never kind of know where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you ever try to predict what'll be the
next big thing and almost get ahead of the
[SPEAKER_02]: curve in that regard?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, to be honest, I don't really,
I prefer, I try to just work in what I
[SPEAKER_00]: really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to jump too fast on all the
hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll work with the strains that are the
hot thing though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong, but I'm always a bit
later than the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to grow all of them before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so like I just did that gelato
crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking some of the hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll cross with it what I like more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I crossed it with sour D.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, I definitely use some of the
hype strains, but I'm not trying to like
[SPEAKER_00]: when something new is the hype and it's
not my hype, that means it's from someone
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the type of guy to then take it
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it and be the first to throw those
seeds into the market.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we just loop back to the Mac for a
moment, I noticed a while back on your
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram, you put a post up and you had
managed to accumulate 10 packs of Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did that feed and hunt go for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever get a chance to do it yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I didn't have 10 packs of Mac one
though, but yeah, CapSend sent me and my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend sure to multiple packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those selections are just happening now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you excited for that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely excited for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend is running them in the States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what type of work would you want to
pair with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, that would be too early to say,
yeah, I got to see and smoke those before
[SPEAKER_00]: I can like, before my mind starts to work
and picking like the combinations and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm, I'll next coming one and two
years, I'll be crossing a lot with the
[SPEAKER_00]: sour D line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything that really interests me
probably also gets crossed with that for
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Mac is a pretty hashy type
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know he did a bangers and Mac,
which is my head banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes Mac.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very curious to see what comes out of
those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how did you feel about the Mac in
general?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you've had a chance to smoke some
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cap came to bring me some when I was
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it smokes very smoothly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it's not my personal type flavor
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very strong wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything about that is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not 100% my flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing it's very,
I think it's pretty hashy in the way it
[SPEAKER_00]: smokes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It burns really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is with wheat, when wheat looks like
wheat white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that the stock that the
trichome is on most times are longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes the wheat look white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the trichome itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those types of strains, that have a
longer stock, they seem to burn different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they smoke really nice for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the sour D has really short stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of trichomes, but really
short stocks, which makes it a good strain
[SPEAKER_00]: for dry screening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the strains with longer stocks,
they get more dirty dry screen easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're harder to screen clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Mac could be, when you breed
with it, I think it could be a good strain
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow in like Morocco and for hash
fields and stuff like that, to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's certainly undeniable, the
overwhelming resin content of at least the
[SPEAKER_02]: Mac one cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some little controversy surrounding it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to quickly ask you, which you may
not have too much of an opinion on,
[SPEAKER_02]: but there's been some whispers recently
about the genetics of Mac being possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most notably the Colombian aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of been suggested by a few
people that it just could actually be some
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of super silver haze cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the evidence from that derives
from the fact that by caps description,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just doesn't seem to fit the flowering
time of Colombians.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too short at nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever suspect something like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you have any opinions on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that what the plan that he calls
the Colombian, yeah, he got from a family
[SPEAKER_00]: from Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said they were very special.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a hundred percent sure that
they're a Colombian land race.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I smoked it by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought me that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely has a recognizable thing
with like a super silver type terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I know from Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely had a similarity to things
like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's, I think kept very genuine
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In where he got it from and what it is and
what he thinks it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I don't think it's like what the
Colombian, like most people know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be some hybrid seeds that came
over from Europe before there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the person says they're
very special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a lot of possibilities
in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you in the analysis that I
believe him when he says that that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: it was given to him as for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just on a kind of, oh, and the other
little caveat when I was at the Emerald
[SPEAKER_02]: Cup and I got to smoke some Mack from cap,
it was by far the standout of the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: No question.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grows great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, his crew and they didn't grow
great weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow such nice weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in the context of anyone who's
ever had some Mack from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no dispute.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, yeah, that's some of the
best weed I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then other times you get other people
who have grown the Mack one and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really just not even in the same ballpark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to me, that highlights the skill
that they've got over that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's with a lot of strains here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, like a certain way they need
to be grown or best way to say it is when
[SPEAKER_00]: you select plants for a greenhouse or
indoor grow, you select them on that
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which made that plant very perfect for
that system as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you would probably pick a different
plant if you grow an indoor on soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you grow indoor on hydro.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'd tried some outdoor grown Mack
and it just wasn't the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but if you would have select Mack
outdoor, you probably would have selected
[SPEAKER_00]: a different plant as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just it's very catered to what it was
selected in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last little kind of hype question for
this little block.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you ever get into the tangy craze?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did do some things with orange type
strains and also tangy, jelly bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm personally not the biggest fan of
orange flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get sickening really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the extract of it are amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extracts are always amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm personally not the biggest fan of
the orange flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a very good, strong terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very nice and unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of character, but it's not my
personal smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, what are your
favorite terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke sourdise, cams,
OG, I got to be honest, I kind of enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: skittles as well the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoking that during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like like Afghanis that have that hash
type flavor in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That NSE type thing and stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, what are some of
the terpene profiles that you really wish
[SPEAKER_02]: were still around, but have seemingly
vanished?
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, I used to grow a plant
that really smelled like a blueberry candy
[SPEAKER_00]: type smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've tried to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown so many different blueberries
and from different people and from DJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never found that typical terp like
that ever again.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, it's such a common point made,
you know, that everyone knows and
[SPEAKER_02]: recognizes DJ for the amazing work he's
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, it's so goddamn hard
to find that bang on blueberry fino,
[SPEAKER_02]: which most people have had once in their
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it exists, but it's just
like, God, where is it hiding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm still looking for a Jack
Harrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There used to be a Jack Harrow cut here in
the South of Holland, yeah, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: selected by Navels.
[SPEAKER_00]: He sold that cut to a group that runs a
coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Navels didn't keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they lost it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was extinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that cut of Jack Harrow is nothing
like I've ever found in the seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: not when I'm breeded with it or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just got some seeds, bag seeds that
came out of that time from that weed in
[SPEAKER_00]: that coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I got hope again to maybe find and
revive that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one smelled so strong of fucking
church incense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of these other hazes have such a
strong incense smell as that had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was not a high weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very strong stoned weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which just doesn't really fit the haze
profile either.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bit faster flower as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be done 11, 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've, I've been lucky enough to
try the what's referred to as the 10 K
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack Harrow cut to other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's known as just Jack Harrow's personal
cut of Jack Harrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it sounds quite different to what you
describe, but I mean, everyone knows that
[SPEAKER_02]: good Jack Harrow is kind of unbeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This weed, when it was here, you could
only max buy two grams of clients.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause otherwise they would run out too
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody, every day went back to buy
those two grams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would try to get your friends,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To buy you two grams as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like total crazier in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a big hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody in this city.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my age still remembers that like
one of the best weed that was in town.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So brings us to an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the best bud you've ever smoked
ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is there a close second?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that was the third thing I thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I thought, let me think about,
let me go through all these things in my
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why there's nothing that can top that to
be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got all the flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really strong as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something we've touched on loosely,
but haven't really delved into thus far.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you feel about concentrates and you
know, the rise of all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: Connoisseur concentrate varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a big part of the future as
well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely like all the solventless
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like smoking that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that it opens up a whole new
window.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when life extracted, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these fertile terpenes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a very different product as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which kind of makes that that flower,
you can change it in different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: tastes and stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's the same source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think medically it has a big purpose as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I guess the extension of that idea,
how do you feel about vape pens and the
[SPEAKER_02]: way they've seemingly kind of taken over
the casual enthusiast community,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially within the States?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like it's a good or a bad
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't smoke any distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's your reasons for doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, a lot of it is not, I don't like the
way it smokes in these pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes my throat tingle and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know today there's like very clean
distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years ago, most of it wasn't even
fully clean either.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know what to get made from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, that's not my product to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would prefer a solventless or I do smoke
some of these sauce pens though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a distillate I'm not the biggest fan
of to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your favourite type of
concentrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, that would be fresh frozen
isolator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what do you tend to do with your
trim when it's ready to be processed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I have seed crops,
I dry screen everything before the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: are taken out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I most times have more dry skin to my
disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then other things, but the fresh frozen
washed hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then freeze dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really nice product.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, a lot of that really high quality
concentrates made in that regard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really available in many
countries outside of like, say America and
[SPEAKER_02]: Holland, maybe Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Spain is even way more than it
is in Holland, that type of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it takes a lot of material as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an expensive product when cannabis is
very expensive in your country or when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fully legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then why would you then you probably
better off smoking flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to worth for your money kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these products get very expensive,
of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in line with our comments made about
the vape pens and kind of how they're
[SPEAKER_02]: taking over the the amateur consumer
market, do you feel like it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: more or less be inevitable that we'll see
the takeover of corporate cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is this a bad thing per se?
[SPEAKER_00]: We will definitely see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we already seeing a takeover of
corporate cannabis everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally do think that in the coming
years, that market will even out a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will first take everything over and
they'll kick everybody out kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the people are not happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then they only kind of get the
midst to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some big people that do it well
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the biggest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the mid size, there's a lot of
people growing really good flour on a big
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't get me wrong when it's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of weed that's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though we all want it to be all
small home and mom and pop type gross,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's realistic when it's
like a fully legal market.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing when you look at beer and wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A real wine drinker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would like the wines that get produced
on smaller scale and very special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the big masses.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only care for that cheaper red wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't mind that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be the same with the
cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big masses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not like all the really cannabis
heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are really like passion and totally
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't even know that many strains
or whatever and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody is smoking every day or like
we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's the biggest part of the
public that will smoke.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there will always be a place for big
corporate and for, as we call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-suite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the market for the high,
high quality and the specialized things,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, is smaller than most people think in
the big mass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you think the connoisseur
community will survive and adapt during
[SPEAKER_02]: this inevitable takeover?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we always have, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what happens, people will
always, no matter if it's legal,
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal, whatever, the real people that
are really interested in, they will always
[SPEAKER_00]: keep on germinating seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will always be growing the better
wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times that will still stay in
the gray market for a while, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in these legal places,
it's not possible for every, these
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses in some places are so expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hard to get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go through so many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already need capital to even start it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which needs to be a legal capital as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like, oh, I made a hundred
thousand growing wheat legally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to start go legal and I'll
use this hundred thousand to start up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the way it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So legal money needs to come in for
something big to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's kind of no other roads than
there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do you feel about the idea of
companies or even individuals like say
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders who want to patent their work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like this is just an
inevitable fact of the legalization or do
[SPEAKER_02]: you feel like it's a significant step in
the wrong direction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's always been free because it's
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wouldn't copyright anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at any other seed or
breeding with other plants, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: normal kind of, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can understand for some people as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be abused though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what everybody's scared about being
abused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm scared about that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these bigger people just taking
shit away that other people made and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if you really worked for things
for many years, um, and you could,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't fucking be angry at people to be
honest for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there always will be a huge fucking
free market anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause anything that's already been sold or
that's already won a prize, then you
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot copyright that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already a free for all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, to copyright a strain,
um, it's not as easy as it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it needs to be unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to prove all these steps before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, a lot of these things can't
even be copyrighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kind of already in public domain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just jumping to a slightly different
but related point, how do you feel about
[SPEAKER_02]: the rise of celebrities jumping on the
cannabis bandwagon?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like specifically, I'm sorry, I'm sure
you've seen that Seth Rogen has launched
[SPEAKER_02]: his own brand and you know, we've had that
Dan Bilzerian guy hovering around for a
[SPEAKER_02]: while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like this is good in the sense
that it's just giving greater exposure to
[SPEAKER_02]: the masses or do you think in general,
it's just a move towards generic negative
[SPEAKER_02]: bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's very good for the big
public opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and making it accepted for like all
the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't accept it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's very good for things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and no matter what it is, that's going
to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that have money, invest their money
in those types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you smoke weed, yeah, I understand
they will invest it into weed type things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we all know that if you're a good
actor, that doesn't mean you have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I mean, if you're good before the
camera, that doesn't mean you can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have good people, the weed can
be good just as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I guess we just have to test all of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And would you ever buy cannabis that was
labeled simply as hybrid or indica?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to have something more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs something more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate buying weed that I cannot smell or
touch, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand you can't touch weed in
dispensary or in a coffee shop anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: today, but, um, I want to feel and smell
it before I buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very understandable sentiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sadly I missed you at the last Emerald
Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were both at, but I'd love to know your
opinion on the event overall and what
[SPEAKER_02]: event do you enjoy the most?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I love the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I went there, I was, uh, I was so,
I didn't expect it to be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were so, I thought it was very
crowded.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe a little bit too crowded for the
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was, um, I've never seen seed sales
as happened at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen anything like that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spandibus is not like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spandibus is a really nice show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the Emerald, wow, I've never seen
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what was the most impressive cannabis
you saw at the Emerald Cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'd be honest, I didn't see that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you have to understand when I go to
these events, yeah, there are so much
[SPEAKER_00]: people that want to see you or you're
trying to meet or having a little talk to,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, that the days just fly by there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I almost never can see the whole expo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, I can definitely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the interesting thing is, is that you
would expect pretty much everything that
[SPEAKER_02]: you get shown is pretty good, but sadly
there's only a few standouts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always the private weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's kind of people that are
visiting, um, that grown out stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those people will have the best
most times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think is one of the most
underrated clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: And why do you think people seem to flock
to specific clones, like cookies,
[SPEAKER_02]: given that even by your own admission,
they've got a lot of downsides,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the yield and the stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's just a hype and market value
and, uh, people need to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that makes it still that, yeah,
the cookie thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so what do you think is one of the
most underrated clones?
[SPEAKER_02]: In your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think a clone that has a very bad
name, but if you look at all the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates from today, it kind of should
be in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's the critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was not expecting you to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's a really nice fruity weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not my personal thing,
but I, for extract and it's fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: it yields, it's really easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised that's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a big thing to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody hates on it because,
uh, the Spanish always use it to reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: and hit everything with it because it
produced so much, uh, pollen when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: reversed and it doesn't give much Hermia
offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they love it so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they cross it with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but on itself pure, um, that cut
that's everywhere in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, live resin from that is gotta be
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't understand why that's not been
grown in fucking piles in the U S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can certainly attest that I've had some
critical Jack in the past and that was
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely memorable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, what do you think
overall about the Spanish scene?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it something you're looking to explore
further yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think it's going to be the new
big place to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I lived in Spain in 2007, 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was very different than,
than it is now, but I've always been
[SPEAKER_00]: coming there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come there a couple of times a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have many friends over all of Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the scene there is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gross every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the vibe is like it used to be in
Holland now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause all these smaller passionate
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, um, so for that, I think it's re it's,
it's making a lot of progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in, from Europe, it's
definitely the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most things happening at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's still, everything is illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think it's legal there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, um, you can grow some weed for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, not in the way most people do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you think that a lot of amateur
people have the wrong idea in that it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: common idea or sentiment to hear people
say, you know, I'm going to pack my bags
[SPEAKER_02]: and move to Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that that's a bit of an ill
conceived thought?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, when you compare in Europe where
you're best off to grow weed, it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause if you don't do it too big,
yeah, there's not much of a problem to be
[SPEAKER_00]: honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they don't come into your house very
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which has to do with the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, houses and rents are very cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's very socially accepted as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, even though it's illegal,
the chance of getting caught or getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into trouble is way smaller than in almost
every other country in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's still some hope there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can grow really good outdoor weed
there, like really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that's a cheap way for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making this step, even though you're
not having a lot of money and stuff.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Spain is not that expensive as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times it's cheaper to live
there than where people live in currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then if they can grow some plants
outdoor, it doesn't cost much money as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the possibility is there for a lot of
people as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Spain commonly known for its feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will you ever offer feminized seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you've been asked this in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I do some feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've only sold them in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I have I'm currently making
feminized seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, everybody knows I'm all about regular
seeds, but the market definitely demands
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like most companies, they only sell
like five or 10% regular seeds,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they offer them and then the rest is
all feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not because they made that,
but that's also because that's what people
[SPEAKER_00]: buy in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you think that there's a
misconception within the community that
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized seeds are better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Better for growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the reason why they sell so well,
um, in Europe is because, um, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people only want to grow a few plants,
um, and they grow with like one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so they cannot keep moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only want to have five, like in
Holland, they only want to have five
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if they have five plants,
they won't get any punishment if they are
[SPEAKER_00]: caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, then they prefer feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if the plant number is not a problem,
I personally prefer to just pop twice as
[SPEAKER_00]: much seeds and pop regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of growing, what is your number
one grow tip for our audience?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what's something that you
commonly see that gets overlooked or an
[SPEAKER_02]: aspect of growing, which is fairly
underrated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, the thing I see here in Europe a
lot is people only really start to
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate on, um, their yield and their
flower once plants are in flower for four
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing about growing
cannabis is the start is the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have any roots, you cannot
get a lot of fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think people should concentrate a
lot on rooting their plants really well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A point that I've discussed with,
uh, the legend himself, Duke Diamond,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot is that people don't pay enough
attention to the root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even a way in which people can select
males is when you're doing the selection
[SPEAKER_02]: of the males to literally tease the,
the medium out of the root ball and take a
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the root ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of see the male that I think is the
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have a big root ball?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I think that that's an interesting
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a very interesting and very
good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the inevitable question, what medium do
you prefer to grow in and what advantages
[SPEAKER_02]: do you think this has?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, me, um, I grow all different mediums,
um, but I mostly grow cocoa at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when I look to my, like my group and
my friends, there are the people that I
[SPEAKER_00]: work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have one group that only grows
hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then I have one group that only grows
in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow mostly organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as when I grow for myself to smoke,
um, I prefer, uh, soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but then I'll grow like 80% organic
and 20% mineral.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you feel like you're getting the
best of both worlds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I, I know some really good growers
who do exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a very strong advocate of always
telling people, like, um, or I grow 80%
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral, 20% organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be on cocoa or hydro
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when I grow on soil, I'll grow 80%
organic and 20% mineral.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the best from both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's very smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weed is very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you get a lot of good, a lot of flavor
points and stuff from organic wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you can get a lot of strength,
um, and, um, nice structure and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that very easily with, uh,
a mineral supplement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this might be a bit of a hard question
for you to quantify, but over the years,
[SPEAKER_02]: how many different plants do you think
you've grown?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think exposing yourself to a
wide variety of genetics makes you a
[SPEAKER_02]: better grower or a better breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: A better breeder, I definitely think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, um, it's just like a cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more different food you've eaten and
tasted yet, the better, you can work with
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, how many, oh man, I, I wouldn't
even dare to put a number on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but the last years we did such big
germinations of so many different seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, um, it really flew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last years, um, I must have grown more
than 500 varieties, more than 500 for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you popping a new strain,
whether it be yours or someone else's,
[SPEAKER_02]: how many seeds do you like to pop to get a
feel for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why I asked this is because
often in Australia, where I'm from,
[SPEAKER_02]: which a lot of people probably already
know, um, you see people popping like
[SPEAKER_02]: three seeds out of a 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just like, you know, I try not to be
harsh, but like, I just have to shake my
[SPEAKER_02]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you only see like, that's like
opening a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you taste three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let me, it all depends on the source
of the seed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The free seeds are not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but let's just say most seed packs are
like 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you pop that, you should see a part
of the whole gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're good seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you want to see everything that's
in there and they're really good stable
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, um, then it's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably like 200 seeds.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's already good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grow like a land raise,
yeah, you probably need like 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can certainly agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes me look back at some of the
work that earlier guys did where they had
[SPEAKER_02]: to breed things for multiple generations
just to stabilize it before they could
[SPEAKER_02]: even think about out-crossing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you start with, um, like really
raw land raised seeds, or even hybrids
[SPEAKER_00]: that are like messy, as I call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so they have a lot of variations and
herms and everything in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you need to grow, um, a lot of seeds
yet to make a group out of those that all
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have those bad things in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to cross those with each
other, the whole group, um, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate them all again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that percentage of all the
problems should go down and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's why you can start only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it all depends on your starting
point, how many seeds you need to germ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you want to be really serious and,
um, want to do it all at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think with modern hybrid bred seeds,
if you pop 500 seeds, you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you don't need 10,000 like with land
raised seeds or 5,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that point in mind, what
requirements do you place on your own
[SPEAKER_02]: strains?
[SPEAKER_02]: Before you deem it ready for market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what type of things would make you
reconsider whether you're going to release
[SPEAKER_02]: a strain or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my aim, my aim is, um, to when you pop
one or two packs of seeds, that you find
[SPEAKER_00]: the type of plants that, um, I wanted you
to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what I think the strain
represents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or that is like the cut that I picked
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's what I try to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's not done every strain yet,
but I have quite a few strains which are
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like the back crossing so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can corner some, um, uh, trades and
phenos, um, in that gene pool more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, uh, there's less variation and
you have a bigger chance to find that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing in less seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so like, for example, the head banger,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you pop two packs of seeds,
you, you, you, some people have a hard
[SPEAKER_00]: time to really pick what they want to
keep.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there is some variation in it,
but it's not all over the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant is clearly the same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with some of the seeds of today,
if you pop them, um, some things for me as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, like, let me give an example,
um, skull cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's a sour head stash, uh,
times biker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that has way more variation than a
head banger, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will find very, a lot of different
things in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that's not like what I would
normally sell or release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but people do love the variation these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think there's also a very big
difference in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like in America, people, uh,
germinate these seeds to select a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a clone to keep as a mom to be
cropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I hear it, it's a lot of times not
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people kind of want to buy a pack of
seeds, grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two, three years later,
they think, Oh, that was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to grow that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to buy a pack of seeds and
find the similar things that they found
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that's a bit of a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when it's for selection, um,
and for commercial market as a producer,
[SPEAKER_00]: people try to have their own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then they want kind of more variation
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when it's to American people and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what would you say would be a kind of a
deal breaker for you with a strain?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, the hypothetical I like to give
people is if you had a strain and you just
[SPEAKER_02]: thought it was amazing, it was unique,
it was going to take the market by storm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the downside was that there was like
one hermy in every pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just on average, would that be a deal
breaker for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if not, what would be the definitive
deal breaker?
[SPEAKER_02]: If everything else was just perfect,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if in my own test gross, um,
like if it would be one herm in a pack,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be like 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I probably, that'd probably be the
max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would probably still release that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would, it would be known though,
before I release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I am very open about every test grow
all these other things and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody, I would, I would clearly
state it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when I don't like to release strains
is when, um, the outcome is weaker than
[SPEAKER_00]: both parents, um, or the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I most times breed with a goal
before I even start selecting plans and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing things.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if that goal's not met, I'm kind of
not really, I lose interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to release it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and when I really don't like to
release is when, um, you get like females
[SPEAKER_00]: in, in those seed packs that are like
really not worth smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I don't like to release it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even a bad plant in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd still be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should still be nice to okay to smoke
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, of course for people, when they only
grow like five or 10 plants and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: like two plants that's just not enjoyable
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's, that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So while we're talking genetics,
what is one strain or just in general line
[SPEAKER_02]: that you love to work with, but you just
don't have access to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I gotta be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in this, I've been growing for
almost 30 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was in the forums very early as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like a really big wide network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I traveled a lot as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This most times if I think of something,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I really start asking,
it kind of almost always really comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's some things that are
probably like maybe not even true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, they used to be taught,
they were talking about this cut called
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia fantasia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I never seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I will be interested to see it if it's
even real, um, outside of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, no, well, maybe some land raises,
but then I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for them yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there any land race that you don't
have access to that you wish you did?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have different Nepalese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have something with Nepal as a
country.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've spent there months, um, before,
um, but it's so diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the weed that I've seen there in
different places, so many different smells
[SPEAKER_00]: and things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That someone says Nepali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that could be so many different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, that definitely intrigues me
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something I haven't digged or
spent a lot of time in, in germinating,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, seeds from Nepal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that's definitely something I want
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it has a huge commercial,
um, aspect though, but it definitely has a
[SPEAKER_00]: big personal interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess that just reinforces that
point you made about B and what he could
[SPEAKER_02]: bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with that being said, are there any
countries you would love to go and do your
[SPEAKER_02]: own little seed pilgrimage in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to go to Afghanistan,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I love to go back to Nepal as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to do, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to, it's not the time to go
there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would love to like to search around
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you feel like there is still some
really good stock to be gained from these
[SPEAKER_02]: areas or do you feel like it's already
been watered down?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as an extension of that, how do you
feel about the actions of some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: people who have gone there in the past?
[SPEAKER_02]: And diluted the seeds with more modern
genetics as for the, um, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of these places are not that
welcoming at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those places is there will be loads of
little cells and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which are now kind of hard to get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's definitely a lot of stuff
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a hundred percent sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also untouched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when it comes to Afghanistan,
definitely in Nepal, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you have to understand that those
are the mountains and the Himalaya.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, even when you, uh, bring in seeds,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then most bigger gross are always in
the valley and not on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that pollen doesn't traveled as far as
in like a flat dry country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and it's kind of reached itself
out as well, pretty fast in most places as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, like in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if they would not bring any more of
these seeds in there, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a couple of years, a lot of things will
turn back as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which has to do with, uh, different
flowering times of these genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it kind of start to separate each
other as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just let it go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so where do you think would be the
highest chance of getting pure land race?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think the Himalayas, like,
like I said, I think mountain regions are
[SPEAKER_00]: very good just naturally, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's harder to get all these cross
pollination and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get all these little cells that
evolve themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think those are always good
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then places where it's not that welcome
and there's not that many people as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, um, yeah, I mean, uh, Afghanistan
used to be very open and very welcoming
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff and you can still go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people won't go there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, then it's protected more as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just jump back to the modern world
of breeding for a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was cruising through your IG last night
and I saw some photos of the white OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: God, they looked awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reminded me of the old school photos of
deep chunk from Tom Hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two part of question, what did you
think of the white OG and what do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think of Tom Hill?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, Tom Hill, um, I grown deep chunk
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked Tom Hill in the back in the days
on the forums and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very knowledgeable guy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone that did it kind of really,
and also teached a lot of us all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, no, I have big respect for
Tom Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, white OG, white OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the strain that I had my first
prize at high times come with and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2010 or 2010, 2009, um, after that I
lost that original mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the police bust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I made a new version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which is the V2, which is what every,
what's everywhere now and what I've sold
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now that one almost every first prize
in Spain years ago.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a very good strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of came out a little bit after,
um, the white fire from OG rascal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a feminized thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this was like a regular OG times the
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time there, there were not that
many of those things around, to be honest
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a lot of OG times the white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that if you had, for example,
jungle boys do a massive Fino hunt of your
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, it would help put you on the map
a bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody looks at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very good at that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, of course, if someone like jungle
boys or if burner or some of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: promoting or people that really get looked
at, if they grow your things, it always
[SPEAKER_00]: makes you noticed way more, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how do you feel about companies
like jungle boys and even cookie fam who
[SPEAKER_02]: are expanding out into kind of the
clothing domain and becoming more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: lifestyle brand than just a cannabis
brand?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of this idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: And would you ever consider it for your
own brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, nah, not me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like a garden guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even a business or a seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I'm not that good at all though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That part of it, even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so no, no, me, that won't happen for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm way too sober.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like a sober Dutch guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, no, I go to Hollywood and LA a lot
and, um, the difference is too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cannot become that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in my nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, um, yeah, I think it's good that
they do that to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it kind of fits a rapper more to
be busy with a clothing brand and
[SPEAKER_00]: lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then a weed brand, if I'm honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, what would be
your advice for a newly starting out
[SPEAKER_02]: breeder?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the best way they can kind of get
themselves and get their name a bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: exposure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, the first thing I think if you
want to like, I get this question so much,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, people want to become a starter seed
company and want to begin and breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now if you want to sell seeds
commercial, um, with how the market is and
[SPEAKER_00]: how the public looks at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, one, you have to be a little bit more
original than it is at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the other thing is if you're going to
make regular seeds, put some effort in
[SPEAKER_00]: your mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the mail is what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to breed your mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't pick a mail from someone else's
seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You always create your own mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can create it with stuff you buy from
different people and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you create your own mail by crossing
things a few times or, um, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then you have a unique mail as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which also makes it, you don't get copied
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all these other people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think that's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I personally think it's always best
to select everything from seed that you
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just use the custom, everybody
used, you're just going to be one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest and you're not going to be noticed
that much either.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now by doing that, you do have to prove
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then people say, Oh yeah,
well, I don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a lot of people say these days,
which is of course is nonsense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every clone comes from seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then I think you do need to enter some
cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's kind of the starting rolling
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what these cups are still good for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if no one knows about you and you win
these cups or you win one or two of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it does to get the ball rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will get a few good growers
interested to try out your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when good growers grow your seeds,
um, and they post it over social media and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, then the flame really
starts to burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a fantastic sentiment that kind of
echoes my exact personal views.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a question I do want to quickly ask
though, how long or what process should
[SPEAKER_02]: someone go through before they start to
label themselves a breeder?
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to me as though, as soon as
people first get the idea that they would
[SPEAKER_02]: like to breed, they're immediately a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you care about things like this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you think a kind of the
necessary steps before you can really
[SPEAKER_02]: start to label yourself as such?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't label myself a breeder to like a
couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, when you cross things,
you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in all honesty, yeah, they are
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even when you start your kind of are a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think if you use it as a
classification, yeah, you gotta have some
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and some knowledge though,
before you put that on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I hate the name master grower,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So master breeder that that's like a no go
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a no go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone calls himself a master breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think, I don't think people
are capable to learn in all of that in
[SPEAKER_00]: even one life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most certainly just to, I had,
I had a, someone email me asking if they
[SPEAKER_02]: could get on the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Oh no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the show's really just kind of for
breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as tongue in cheek, I was like,
Oh, and also master growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they replied and they were like,
well, I'm actually a master grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, dude, I was joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's a terrible term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Master grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we call them head growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good name for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in these bigger operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're like that guy that has to manage
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, are the one and responsible and
stuff that you're a head grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good term for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a master grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a, that's like Kung Fu movie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the way it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's kind of like, you don't
acknowledge that there's, we're all
[SPEAKER_02]: students, you know, there's still more to
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it gets legal and open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see everything moving way faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's going to be so much in the
coming years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us know it all yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think about clone hoarding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's kind of a necessity when
you're breeding to just keep certain
[SPEAKER_02]: things to yourself or at least out of the
hands of public so that it's kind of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure we're a commodity or do you
think overall it's somewhat a hindrance to
[SPEAKER_02]: the community?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I don't like as much is
like when all your clones get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: hands of these other seed makers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my breeding clones get grown for flower
and the flower would be everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to protect something
sometimes when you're a commercial seed
[SPEAKER_00]: company though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of that, I like to share stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shared most of my things with a lot
of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a question I wanted to quickly run by,
it probably could have segued it in
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere earlier, but here is as good as
any point I figure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you ever consider working with
companies like Phylos?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you have any concerns about these
kinds of genetic mapping companies and the
[SPEAKER_02]: potential implications in the future of
what could happen with this data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my friend, sure he had some things
tested from me by them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are doing like a breeding type
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: With them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I did pick what we're going to do
and which gene pool kind of carefully as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I picked Supersilver Haze because it's
so widespread and there's nothing to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect about it, but it's very special
and all those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that'd be a good one to use
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not enter all my special or unique
things in there though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to do that either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is some clones from me that did
get into Phylos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not the one that entered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The A5 cut is in there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that I know is that came from me and
went to someone and that person gave it
[SPEAKER_00]: away to someone else and that one entered
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that one's certified.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that one's genuine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's AC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They entered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can check that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my cut, my melon cut is in there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the mom of the seeds of the melon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's another one in there
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do tell us a little bit more about the
melon or the melon cut itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I saw that one when I was looking
at some of your strains and I was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: melon is one of those terpene profiles you
just don't come across as regularly,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's kind of like a hot
commodity.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of the melon cut?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me just say, I named this cut
melon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 2013 probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people always ask me, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, well, they come from seeds that I
traded on Overgrow and they were labeled
[SPEAKER_00]: fruity skunk number two or three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a few different bags with different
numbers on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely no skunk in it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more, has more OG type thing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one had like a green melon
candy, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type smell and flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other friend says it smells like light
cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the watermelon or the genes that
afterwards came into Kelly and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was their way before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any plans to work it further
at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That weed I used to always only grow it
myself and smoke it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one of my favorite Indicas to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I could only pick two weeds,
I'd probably have that as my Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have my sour D as my likes type
hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely going to work more with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selecting males at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to jump back to a point
you, you didn't specifically say,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I think you're alluding to it before
you've been working with the Dutch
[SPEAKER_02]: consulting company.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that been?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a company I've put up with two
friends and another person.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the financial backbone of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tam and Roger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's companies like one was needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a big success and it's,
it's only just started that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, that's a match made in heaven
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what types of things can we expect
from you guys moving forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do consultancy for most times it's
bigger, bigger projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times it's projects that already
been running and then kind of don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we come in and fix the problem kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm the genetic consultant and genetic
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll bring in a lot of these seed
batches, not just from me, but from
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a gene finder OG on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like our growth specialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's very special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then got 10 is my other partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, um, he's our business guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's the guy to sit at the table with
all these corporate type people and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has like a banking background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are, I call it our bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between like, um, our, our group and
seeing like more of the alternative hippie
[SPEAKER_00]: really garden cannabis type guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like the bridge in
between us and the guys that don't kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: don't grow weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sit behind the desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that makes it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need that bridge in between it for it
to work with better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that seems to work really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you get brought in to help fix up
some of these problem operations,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's one of the most common things you
see that they're getting wrong that you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to fix up for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all the things that we've done now,
they were definitely the genetics was like
[SPEAKER_00]: very boring and just like what you see all
these big people grow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they all grow a lot of gorilla glue
for blue dream, all those type of plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you can already make a big change
in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then IPM is always a huge,
fuck up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all these grows most times are too
dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to grow clean, good
cannabis on a big scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it takes a very good management and,
um, system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for that to work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you work with a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, once you turn it around it,
it's like a, a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're dealing with these large
commercial operations, what's the type of
[SPEAKER_02]: lighting technology you usually advocating
for and does that differ from what you
[SPEAKER_02]: would use on a small homegrown level?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it would be pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that aspect would be, um, a
responsibility for not for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for a gene finder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be his part of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like way more knowledgeable and on
all those things than I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so much test experience with all
these different things as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, me indoor, I, I, I run Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I put up a room somewhere,
um, but in the bigger greenhouses now that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're running there, um, we're putting in,
uh, led lights in the one in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, seems to work well as well.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you have any concerns about the
Gavitas and how they were bought out by
[SPEAKER_02]: Bayer or whatever the Monsanto,
whatever it was a while ago, I heard
[SPEAKER_02]: rumors of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when it is like that, um, I had
beyond, I got ones that are very old yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're from way before that time,
but, uh, no, it sucks if you support
[SPEAKER_00]: something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there is different ones these days
as well, which are just as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the double ended and the 400
volt technique is what really makes those
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I wanted to ask
you a bit more of a general question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think is one of the most
commonly misunderstood parts of breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, I think the, like today everybody
is like, yeah, no, that's an F one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be an F four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, what does that mean then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those things mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's all about the selection and the
stability of the parents used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there is not even that much of the
true F ones for sale in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody calls across an F one these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a true F one.
[SPEAKER_00]: A true F one is bred by two stable
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That don't give a lot of variations on
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and then they think the F two
would be like more stable and the F three
[SPEAKER_00]: would be more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore that all depends on how you
select on the guy that bred it and how he
[SPEAKER_00]: did his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That number doesn't say much like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a big misunderstanding
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what type of labeling or nomenclature
would you want to use for kind of the poly
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids where it is just, you know,
two unstabilized things whacked together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that like a, we can't say P one,
but maybe poly hybrid one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we can't call it a P one because
that's what we call a stable parent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they should not, it should be,
it's just a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they shouldn't even be labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should definitely not be labeled an F
one or we should label the true F ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: true F ones like TF one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I, I always think about this in
the context of like someone like DJ short,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's very much worked his lines from the
bare land races.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it must be frustrating when
you're seeing people label things and
[SPEAKER_02]: yours is the only thing that actually
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually complies with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a, uh, IBL, I hope to in my life,
uh, make two IBLs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which will just be like working on the
lines that I'm already have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause how many IBLs you think you can make
in a lifetime?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you, we go back to Afghanistan,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It took families, many generations to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that in mind, what keeps you
motivated to keep breeding in an ever more
[SPEAKER_02]: challenging environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I will never, I always say you only
lose when you quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, trust me in all these years,
I've bumped into a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I lived the life of the snake and
ladder a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you climb up and you get trouble comes
and you fall down to the ground again.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I will never ever quit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I sell seeds so that I can do more
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it costs a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the passion is bigger than,
than anything in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I go away from my family for months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've taken risks, all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then people think, how the hell
can you do it for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the passion in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do anything to keep on doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can't take the plan out of the boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most important things in
my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my family and my family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are like, they're,
they're almost, they're almost equal to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next question I had for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is your favorite breeder who's
currently active and have you ever
[SPEAKER_02]: considered doing a collab with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of breeders that I really
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I respect, um, all of them are pretty
different, um, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like, um, I have a lot of respect for
Simon from serious seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, then two of my friends,
which is JJ and Camarado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then both I as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are people I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grow a lot of seeds from as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then when people ask me or my
friends, I say, Oh, you got to try some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this guy and that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those seats are good as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those four people I really think are
definitely deserve a lot of recognition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I noticed that in
the past you'd done a collab with Mosca
[SPEAKER_02]: using the C99BX.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first question that jumped to mind
was when Soul and Duke re-brought back
[SPEAKER_02]: Brothers Grimm, did you immediately think
to yourself, Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, let's redo that project with the
real C99.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or was it very specific to that
relationship you had with Mosca?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know Mosca for a long time
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, and at that time there was no
other, he was the only one offering C99 at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was what he was known for at that time
on the forum as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we do a co-op that it was very obvious
it needed to be that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have not grown the re-releases of,
uh, Brother Grimm's C99.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I still have to do that to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't grown them yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Duke did an awesome job bringing that one
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my next question is, do you think it's
possible to selectively breed cannabis for
[SPEAKER_02]: specific medical properties?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for example, do you think you could
set out to create a strain that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: help with like Crohn's for example,
or do you think it's just kind of luck of
[SPEAKER_02]: the drawer in terms of if the strain
happens to be specifically good for a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain ailment?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think with lab testing these days,
um, I mean you, it needs to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: People need to test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they found out this works
way better, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have, have that happen with a
couple of different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can compare all these lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can see which terpenes or
which cannabinoids, um, or like similar in
[SPEAKER_00]: those different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we know what to breed for and what to
select for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can make that way stronger for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, then we can breed strains specific
for certain illnesses and certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you had the time or the space,
what ailments would you most want to try
[SPEAKER_02]: to breed some cannabis for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything that's on your list that
you feel is not currently being catered
[SPEAKER_02]: to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, I think, um, like me personally,
I have like a ADD, which is like a raising
[SPEAKER_00]: brain syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would like to make something for
that, but I think it's pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold water needs to be in a Tifa type gene
pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's probably going to be found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I have like a lot of thoughts that
go really fast inside my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a ping pong ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm looking for something that gives
me like a rest in my head without losing
[SPEAKER_00]: any energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, all those types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which kind of only get with some of these
hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think some of these hazes are like
very noticeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unexplored on the medical part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they definitely keep some very
strong medical value, which has not been
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bit of an odd question, but I love to
throw it by all our guests.
[SPEAKER_02]: How important do you find it is to engage
with social media as a breeder?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we see, you know, breeders on both
sides of the fence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you personally sit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think social media is, is a very,
um, very valuable tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, um, it's definitely not as pleasant as
it sometimes can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that happens everywhere that
happens on the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've been online so long on all these
forums and stuff that I'm pretty okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty good in handling like all the
negative type things and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which if you handle it the right way,
it doesn't become too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, um, I'm not that straight
or I don't always tell my opinion or
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you don't feel the freedom
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and on this, these days on social
media, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You constantly have to prove yourself or,
um, you have to be used to answering the
[SPEAKER_00]: same questions like every day.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll get the same questions every
day, um, from different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, where can I get this or, um,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter if you said it five
minutes before, yeah, people don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: that well on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter what you put on there,
that info is gone kind of in 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, you have to repeat yourself
a lot on social media.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then how do you, how do you feel things
online rate these days compared to back in
[SPEAKER_02]: the day when the forums were much more
active and popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the forums in the old days,
uh, that was, yeah, that like overgrow
[SPEAKER_00]: when that was almost the only thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then definitely in the earlier years
of it, that was like so special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first time, um, a lot of
underground breeders, um, connected with
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that normally wouldn't have never
ever met each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we learned so much from each other
then in such a short time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that that gave a lot of friendship and
a lot of connections that are like still
[SPEAKER_00]: solid today.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and people wanted to share everything
with each other.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody sends the seeds and clones and,
uh, um, explained exactly how their system
[SPEAKER_00]: worked and stuff to that, uh, to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that totally changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to do that, you get
everybody in saying how you should do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, or like, uh, complaining or saying
something's not right about it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are not, it's not enjoyable for
people to tell and, um, do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's a whole different world now,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that brings us to our last little lot
of questions that I like to call the quick
[SPEAKER_02]: fire questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's jump into them.
[SPEAKER_02]: First one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your favorite food?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, India food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like curry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What type, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Madras, butter chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like the one with the spinach a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gosh, Josh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dolls as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can get down to some food together by
the sounds of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to go for, um, everywhere with
all the traveling and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to go to really good restaurants
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of the big joys in
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good food, good smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So next one I wanted to ask, what is one
of the most memorable smokes you've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: had?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's probably a happy brother dry
screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the a five dry screen topped it off.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Static leaned a five dry screen is like
very special.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost mate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, please go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always makes you trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost makes you trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a color view and stuff like a
mushroom type effect and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I only, I never get with smoking
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on, on the other end of the spectrum,
what's the strain where you've smoked it
[SPEAKER_02]: and you haven't thought it was a very good
kind of the least agreeing with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well I've once grew some plants and
one of them smelled like human shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it also tasted like, no, it also
tasted like so gross that you really could
[SPEAKER_00]: not smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of my friends could smoke it
either.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it, it, it, when you just lighted the
joint, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you took one pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost like make it, it makes you gawk
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just not, not smokeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is truly an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was awful.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So out of all of your strains that you've
got coming out in the near future,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to exclude the sour BX from
this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we've already spoken about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So outside of that, what are you most
excited for to release in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think people are very waiting for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making a five S ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think people are very waiting for
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, myself, um, I like things like,
um, I'm doing some skittles things,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, uh, I think are going to be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, and then some of the Brazilian
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that will be a little while before
that comes as probably next year,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that a five will come this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put me down on the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm already sweating thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm crossing the reverse pollen with the
other cuts as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing a C five times a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm doing the old school haze,
which is from the C club, that old cut
[SPEAKER_00]: from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that one times the five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I got an HPA skunk in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might throw in the amnesia because I've,
everybody wants me to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll probably do pollinate that as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the breeder end of the spectrum,
who's an up and coming breeder who you
[SPEAKER_02]: think might be kind of, you know,
one of the next big names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm not that up to date most times
with, with these things though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people, people know,
yeah, but, um, you know, thunder fudge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thunder fudge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says his stuff is fucking the bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a really good guy as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, his stuff's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the sour Larry stuff is, is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: His ultimate cam is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, he did really good stuff and reviving
all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, he, if anyone wants to buy some one
seeds that are not that known or out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, his stuff is, yeah, it's really
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're now on the desert Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can pick three strains to take with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlimited supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: What three?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sour diesel, a five and the melon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, what a nice little well-rounded
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need something for every different part
of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So final question.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could go to any place, anywhere in
history, any time, presumably to collect
[SPEAKER_02]: some land race seeds, what time period and
where would you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'll go back like really far.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, early 1900s and go to Asia,
China.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get some, some Jurassic shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go all the way to the fucking where it
started.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you better go back to where it
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, no, I feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that being said, did you have any
shout outs or comments you wanted to make
[SPEAKER_01]: before we wrap things up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I want to give a shout out to
all the people I've been working with the
[SPEAKER_00]: last years, um, gene finder, Tam,
um, Kali Kush farms, um, extra big shout
[SPEAKER_00]: out to Emmett from pure sativa,

[SPEAKER_00]: easier.

anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have quit already because I just
don't like selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, those people really make,
made it blow up and without those people,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I wouldn't be doing it anymore.
