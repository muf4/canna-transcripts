[SPEAKER_01]: Guarantee not just on germination,
also on satisfaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll love them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check it out.

Radio Ridge Nursery for all the best cuts
[SPEAKER_01]: in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exclusive breeder cuts you can't get
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why waste your time phenohunting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should do phenohunting, but if you
can't, go check out their cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, big shout out to our friends at
Organic Gardening Solutions, Top Shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: Seed Bank, and of course, Dragonfly Earth
Medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, guys, if you want to help
support the show, go check out the
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of additional content on there for
you to check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are extremely grateful to have
Norcal ICMAG here to lay down the history.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about some modern strains and what
he's up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big thank you and welcome to the one
and only, the forum legend himself,
[SPEAKER_01]: Norcal ICMAG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: As always, I want to know, what are you
smoking on, my friend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much right now, the newest thing is
going to be the OG KB X2, and then I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting on these new Apple Fritter crosses
to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're still a little ways away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the OG KB X2 is basically the OG KB
crossed to a Blueberry headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot more vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not as stony as the OG KB,
the original one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely more of a plant that
you'd rather grow than the OG KB because
[SPEAKER_00]: the OG KB is kind of a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just on a personal note,
I'm curious, what's the flavor on that one
[SPEAKER_01]: like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I hear a lot about it,
but I've never been able to try it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I literally just finished
flowering it out, which is when I saw you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the first batch I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's still some dialing in to
be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's a very Blueberry
dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of want to further work the
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just a matter of getting the time
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But me and Compound Genetics are actually,
I gave him the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's going to be crossing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say it's like Jet Fuel Gelato or
some of his males that he has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's going to be very interesting
to see as far as what comes about from
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some really nice stuff come from
that Jet Fuel Gelato, no question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to divert back, you mentioned
some apple fritter crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always keen to hear about apple
fritter.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you tell me about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was just a cut that I got from
my homies in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's definitely like, you know,
it's a very nice cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just happened to cross it
because I hit it with some pollen that I
[SPEAKER_00]: got from my homie, like always be
flowering Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, I had some purple pollen as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: From like CSI, like Humboldt, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some males from one of the breedings
that he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I utilize that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like it was like an open
pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's going to be interesting to see
what comes out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I'm like, I'm sexing all those
seeds, like right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you looking to preserve the apple
flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I often hear people debate about
whether the apple flavor really even is
[SPEAKER_01]: apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's kind of a roundabout,
but it's not super on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to keep that or refine it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what's your plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'd like to cross it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some blueberry F7s from DJ Short
that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get a chance to have like a little
bit of time to to, you know, fully like
[SPEAKER_00]: focus myself on that, on that work,
I'll, you know, I'll crack them and
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate them and and then utilize those
for to cross to that and see where we get,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, besides that also,
I want to hit it back to the OGKB as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so we'll see where it all where
it all ends up at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the meantime, they're all just
kind of in the vault as far as holding on
[SPEAKER_00]: to those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely keen to see what pans out
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got to ask the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any kind of fond memories of
any of the older DJ Short work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, everyone has one thing
where like, you know, I used to get this
[SPEAKER_01]: really good flow or I used to get this
really good blueberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have one of those stories?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's the only time that I would
have ever had access to like DJ Short's
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I never bought me like, you know,
like from overseas when when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: buying stuff on like Seedbay or Breedbay
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like it would have been in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Amsterdam in like 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had like a couple different
phenotypes of like his blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was I think it's a LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think about the strains off the
top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, like if I actually have his
book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it Skywalker?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it wasn't like Skywalker came way
after after all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's there was an LSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say it was one of the strains he
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: The original blueberry is one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was there was a few other
ones that he was pretty well known for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I have his book here,
but I mean, well, actually, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody actually took the guide book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the strains would be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: In there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember going to like Barney's and
and and I think that the Bulldog in in
[SPEAKER_00]: Amsterdam and they had a bunch of his
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of those lines have probably been
reworked or or just are not even like like
[SPEAKER_00]: around anymore.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that he kind of stopped
formally working with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at that point, I think they
started popping seeds to find new parents
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now with like tissue culture,
like being more prevalent, it's definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot easier to preserve genetics for like
a longer period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's really hard to keep a
plant alive for, like I said, like 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I love to ask people this question.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the oldest clone that you're aware
of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, like to me, like me still having
the OG KB is pretty like it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because like that plant is like when
I got those when I got that strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was it was it was butchered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in very bad condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's it's it's very interesting to
see how like, you know, like how it does
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it's pretty healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've actually had a tissue culture by
my homie at the labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and like, you know, like he's pretty
much trying to figure out, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the issues that it actually had,
because I mean, we went through,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that it's still even like has
any vigor, it's it's kind of impressive in
[SPEAKER_00]: a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, I mean, like I like it's
it's hard to put a, you know, to to to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically tell you a strain that's been
around for so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's like most most stuff has
been lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and unless they backed
everything up by seed or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, like most times,
like back in the days that they didn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: it like, you know, any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, even like if people tell you
that they have a certain strain nowadays,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if somewhere to be like, like they
have like train wreck or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, more than likely, I would I would
probably I wouldn't say I wouldn't believe
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just more of I think it's just
more of that terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, like that's,
you know, that's more of like where they
[SPEAKER_00]: would classify it as far as like in a
train wreck profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's yeah, it's it's at
this at this at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like down the road,
it's keeping a plant alive for that long
[SPEAKER_00]: like train wreck was from like,
you know, I mean, I remember hearing about
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's it's going to be pretty
impressive to find someone that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: has like access to those genetics still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the people who have that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've met a few who I think do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I get what you mean where like that
profile became representative of the
[SPEAKER_01]: strain in a way, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's jump back on track for just a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know everyone's keen to hear us talk
about the OG KB because you just brought
[SPEAKER_01]: it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's put that to the side for just a
minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was I mean, I didn't I didn't
smoke weed until I basically I got out of
[SPEAKER_00]: high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I graduated and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just I pretty much took like the
semester off and I didn't go to college or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was just I would I was hanging
out at my homie's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, we we pretty much we
used to like literally just throw down on
[SPEAKER_00]: like a dub every day and a 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: And go to his house and just chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his parents were cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, like my homie is not with
us anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it was like we had like a
tight little crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that was like our daily ritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I started smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then pretty much I got into selling
weed as a result of all that, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: figured it would be cheaper to just,
you know, grab, you know, grab a grab more
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, like a larger amount,
like grab more quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it was because we were paying like
back then we were paying 20 bucks for a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking for a dub, which is like it's kind
of like unheard of nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do you remember any of like the
notable names strains of that time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, back then, people I mean,
people were just throwing names on
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever there was like Juicy Fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there was M-39.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot a lot of the stuff was
coming from from, you know, from British
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia, from from from, you know,
from Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it like I said, like like Juicy Fruit,
M-39, critical mass, I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like just very
commercialized strains at this point that
[SPEAKER_00]: people normally like if you had it to this
like this day, you probably would not be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get much money for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did you have a soft spot for any of
those looking back, like kind of guilty
[SPEAKER_01]: soft spot?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like like it's I mean, a lot of that
stuff is was really it was just like
[SPEAKER_00]: chemmed out, you know, phospho loaded,
you know, like like product that was just
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from, like I said, B.C.,
you know, more than likely like the only
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that was like actually was more
notable would be probably the outdoor that
[SPEAKER_00]: was coming out of like Mendocino and
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like back then,
a lot of the stuff that was in the streets
[SPEAKER_00]: was was all going to be like Canada,
like B.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and it's, you know, like they were kind
of like a lot of the times like they were
[SPEAKER_00]: like what was coming in was stuff that was
kind of bland in the in the in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: of like like a nose as far as like like
the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all kind of has to do with as far
as like they didn't like when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping large quantities of of of
anything, you're not going to want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: smell too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, so all the skunky varieties
were pretty much coming out of like
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino and Humboldt at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, there was like I can't say
there was anything that that was that
[SPEAKER_00]: memorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, understandable, understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess my question is, did you have a
eureka or like a light bulb moment with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis where it all kind of clicked for
you and you realize this was something you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to dedicate yourself to,
so to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, when I started growing, it was it was
like it was very like eye opening in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sense where it just gave me a whole nother
respect for the actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's like medical
properties and how it can help people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like when I went to
Amsterdam, it was in 2006, I went with
[SPEAKER_00]: like Eddie Lepp and we went there and I
met like Arion from Greenhouse Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and like that's kind of when I was
able to actually because we didn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: the clubs here were very like minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say it was medical at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it just there wasn't that as much
of a variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everything was coming from Amsterdam,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a transitionary period where
actually a lot of the stuff started coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from here, like from northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started becoming the staple as far
as like being known as the the like
[SPEAKER_00]: basically like the the the sorry,
my dog is tripping like like basically
[SPEAKER_00]: like like like the that's a staple for
like a lot of the good strains here and
[SPEAKER_00]: also like the like the granddaddy when it
came out or the Urkel actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the bigger like,
you know, game changers and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I would say it was
like the OG and then and then and then and
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course, it definitely fits with
the general consensus that there was that
[SPEAKER_01]: paradigm shift and kind of a changing of
the world's superpowers in regards to weed
[SPEAKER_01]: from, yeah, the Europeans to Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess was there anything notable
about that trip?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you what do you make of Arion when
you met him?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's pretty much I mean,
he was he was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was cool, like, but it gave me a big
like a big understanding as far as as as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as like the game and how everything
works, like as far as seed companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: because at like back then it was like if
you were going to grow, you couldn't go on
[SPEAKER_00]: Craigslist and get clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like at some point like Darkheart
Nursery, they started up like off on like
[SPEAKER_00]: on Craigslist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, you know, you'd want to
grow like the fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you would consider the fire would
be the Cannabis Cup winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you'd open up like like a high
times and and there would be low mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got greenhouse seeds and they,
you know, they they would tout how many
[SPEAKER_00]: like Cannabis Cups they won and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like when I actually went to
Amsterdam, I realized like like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dutch genetics were inferior to what
we have here and actually like in
[SPEAKER_00]: California and you know, in California,
basically, because I was there and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I'm paying the euro was definitely,
you know, the dollar was was definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: weaker than the euro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to pay, you know, like whatever,
18, 20 euros for a gram and like to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that it was actually not like it
wasn't that good of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very eye opening to me,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a really pertinent issue we
should talk about, like people buying cups
[SPEAKER_01]: or rigging cups or however it is,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that was something which was
kind of limited to the European scene or
[SPEAKER_01]: do you think that that's happened and like
what might be some examples of it
[SPEAKER_01]: elsewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, like I couldn't tell you to
what extent it still exists, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely know that like back in the
days, it definitely came off as like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Ariane, he, you know,
he he he would basically I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have so many Cannabis Cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, at the end of the day,
when people are looking for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to start growing there,
they're going to they're going to trust
[SPEAKER_00]: like high times as judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to think that whatever
one the latest Cannabis Cup is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be, you know, the like the hot stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I mean, even like like Eddie Lepp
told me he's like every time that he wins
[SPEAKER_00]: like a cup equates to literally like over
a million dollars in seed sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, that was, you know,
like, you know, quite a bit amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so, you know, it's just a matter
of buying advertising space and high
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no definitive evidence about all
this, but it's kind of like you can I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, you can put two and two together
and, you know, realize that that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like I mean, I was there
myself when I was kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, damn, like I want to when I started
growing, I wanted to grow the like we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have access to clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to grow, you know,
like the best weed ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I assumed that it was pretty much
whatever had won the Cannabis Cup that
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and like that when I went to
Amsterdam, it was kind of eye opening as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as like that wasn't true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us, do you remember about your first
grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: What were you growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it like?
[SPEAKER_00]: The I want to say the strains that like
what I was growing the the first ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, I was actually I was growing in my
mom's in the closet of my mom's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it was O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had gotten like some legit O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: like S.F.V.O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, like those towns were going
for like over six thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like and I happen to meet one of my
homies, homies, and he had these clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it was legit O.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the first first strain I
grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was like, you know, one of the
game changers as far as where people were
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I guess, transitioning more from
like the fruity stuff to more of the gassy
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, like like like,
yeah, I grew that in my mom's closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and I mean, it was it was
definitely it was it was it was pretty,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it was nice to to have your own
my own smoke and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definitely better than most shit
that I was getting on the streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And did you you realize kind of what a
baseline you had?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I often talk to growers and you
realize very quickly that everything's so
[SPEAKER_01]: relative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like what what's your best could be
shit for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you realize at the time you just had
the kill?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I I mean, no, actually,
I did not like I was I like think about it
[SPEAKER_00]: this like to this day, like it's actually
I'm very surprised that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like my homie, he was kind of known he was
more like a connoisseur and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back then, they were connoisseurs were
definitely like the minority within the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the the industry and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like to even be giving those clones,
it's like I'm very I'm still surprised to
[SPEAKER_00]: this day that I actually got those cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like, you know, I like to get
like legit OG clones back then was you
[SPEAKER_00]: normally you would get some shit like,
you know, somebody would just throw the OG
[SPEAKER_00]: name on it just to sell it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was very, you know, I was very
grateful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was it was legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like SFOG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got the Larry after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and like, you know, even to this day,
like it's they're hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Larry is like a personal favorite
of mine, but it's also one I find hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about because there's like that lemon
Larry and it's like most people don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: which one they're getting and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried both and which one do you
prefer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the original one was it was very
like lime greenish and like I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: like, yeah, lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, like nowadays,
it's I mean, it's it's really hard to find
[SPEAKER_00]: those same exact genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like I have not come across
them ever like since, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's kind of like even like like the
Urkel like he like most.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a pretty hard, hard strain to
come across nowadays, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like especially once it got watered down
with the granddaddy and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people were trying to get more of like a
yield out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but yeah, I mean, I like, yeah,
I, you know, like the OG was there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why it was it was a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, like everything seemed to
be like fruity and kind of blandish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And OG was just like like like gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people, you know, people definitely
took, you know, took to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was it like when you were then,
you know, starting to progress in kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: your skills?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd had a few harvests.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting more clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you kind of develop?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like like I pretty much I kept
my closet at my mom's house for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: while, like probably like at least like a
year, year and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at that point, too, I like the
reality is like you didn't have to really
[SPEAKER_00]: grow that good of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there was like a more like
there was a higher margin error for like
[SPEAKER_00]: for error.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I mean, I had shit that when
I was started to do seeds that had
[SPEAKER_00]: literally gotten seeded up and I was still
getting rid of the pounds for like four
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand dollars just because there was so
much shitty weed on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so back then it was,
you know, like I definitely made a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, you know, a nice little chunk of
change off off of that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like two six hundreds in the
closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and yeah, like it's like it was a it
was nice because everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, was coming from more than
likely Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was not it was incomparable to like
what I was even growing when I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: starting off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was and from then, like I got other
spots and, you know, like save my money up
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much, you know, moved on and
like growing more and more like basically
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, getting more lights going
and all that, you know, all that shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a warehouse here in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, like I kind of
regressed a little bit just because like
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole tech boom that came in into play
like the prices for the rent on like the
[SPEAKER_00]: like the warehouses went like through the
roof and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back to residential stuff and,
you know, like that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that's pretty much where we're at
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense, you know, like it's like,
yeah, I mean, getting into the market here
[SPEAKER_00]: in California is pretty, pretty expensive,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of why I choose to do like
more of my consulting and like like dabble
[SPEAKER_00]: in like other states, because it's just
it's it's cheaper and easier to get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's cutthroat in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to jump back, though, just for a
second to how you talked about getting an
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like this is a topic we don't
really delve into a lot on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just wondering, when you first did
get your bigger space, no matter what,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the context was, were you quite
anxious about it or were you just
[SPEAKER_01]: overwhelmingly excited?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what were kind of the factors that
played into mind when you were selecting,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, strains for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you just thinking, well, I've got to
get a good return.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the priority here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or was it like you were able to kind of
just grow whatever you wanted?
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't a consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I mean, back then it's I
mean, it's crazy because the market's
[SPEAKER_00]: completely, completely changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, back then, I would I mean,
I was just buying like a you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: strains from from like seeds from from,
you know, Dutch genetics and whatnot on
[SPEAKER_00]: like Breed Bay and like Seed Bay and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just I just literally remember being
up at like two, three in the morning to
[SPEAKER_00]: like get in on these auctions,
you know, for like certain like strains
[SPEAKER_00]: like like reservoir stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, back then, like honestly,
like it's like the market the way it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it allowed me actually to have a lot of my
mistakes as far as like like like messing
[SPEAKER_00]: shit up, like I said, as far as like
missing males in in the room and then like
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're like, you know, when you're
sorting through seeds and whatnot and and
[SPEAKER_00]: like having like a seeded crop and still
like being able to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nowadays, you wouldn't be able to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was back then it was there was no
there was no I mean, Oji Kush was
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely like the probably like the you
know, the top strain at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was never into like monocropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of I mean, that's that's
actually like my own like not say issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in a sense, I just always was looking
for something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I ran some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran some of, you know, whatever whatever
else is available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like back then you could
pretty much grow whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time, if you were growing
like decently, you would be doing better
[SPEAKER_00]: than whatever is coming was coming through
like on the streets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds
like probably the next big thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: really caught your eye after you were
running the Oji was probably the first
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, like I mean, Oji kind of
like I mean, it's it's still pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: pivotal as far as like like, you know,
like within the market, there's a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: market still forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love like, you know, the gassiness
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, cookies, you know, there's a
reason why cookies was a was a game
[SPEAKER_00]: changer as far as, you know, like why it
is so prominent, like as it is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, yeah, I mean, it's like I said,
it's just a matter of like your market and
[SPEAKER_00]: what you have and, you know, but like
coming to see how like like like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like the first time I ever saw
cookies and came across it, it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people were passing off Bubba's as
cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, a lot of people were
showing me stuff and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this just smells like Bubba, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and when I finally actually got a hold
of the real deal cookies, I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this is what everyone's talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, people were, you know,
trying to pass off shit left and right as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as, you know, being cookies,
like especially Bubba's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, it wasn't,
you know, to me, I was like, it just
[SPEAKER_00]: smells like Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I finally got a hold of like the
actual, you know, real deal cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was I was like, this is I understand
why, you know, why it's a game changer at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was the first sample you got to
try?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it like Forum?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it like Thinmin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I couldn't tell you what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that like the the first packs were
coming through from from like Burner to
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, like they see Oji Kushbread,
which is my homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that was like even like like
Frostboss, like he like I remember like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I was selling them packs like
they they like they had fucked up a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of those batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was a bunch of seated packs
that came through and we were still
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking selling them like like nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is and I want to say like like
probably like 2010 ish, 2009, which
[SPEAKER_00]: actually was like the the crash of the
weed market in a sense where everyone kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of went balls to the wall and grew a bunch
of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the prices like plummeted,
like went through the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, you know, like back then to
be able to get rid of like seated product
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, like people were like
lining up to buy cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was also more of the fact that that
it was only coming out of like the cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: fam little like they're the circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was there's only so much to
go around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, luckily, I knew like like Oji
Kushbread was kind of tied in with all
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was like showing me, you know,
those packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember going to his house and I
was like, yeah, like, actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is like pretty fire, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he told me the tickets,
I was like, like, I don't know if I can
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of this sort of, you know,
this stuff or this kind of a ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there's a certain market
that definitely wanted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like said, like Frostboss and my other
homie, ABF and like a nonprofit,
[SPEAKER_00]: they kind of had that that market where
people were actually like willing to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, pretty crazy.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you said those first couple ones
came through with seeds, you mean that the
[SPEAKER_01]: first batches coming out of cookie fam
when they were grown, it was seeded with
[SPEAKER_01]: like S1s or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, well, no, I mean,
there was like a bunch of batches that
[SPEAKER_00]: came through that were fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there were some that definitely
were seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it was just kind of
like, like beggars can't be choosers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want cookies, then you're going to
have to fucking buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I like, I'd probably like attribute
that to actually all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes that we see today, just because
like there were so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were smart at the time,
you would have you would have planted the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds because because, you know,
the strain was in high demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you remember how long it was
between then and when you first tried
[SPEAKER_01]: OGKB?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the OGKB just kind of like like
pretty much fell into my lap as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: like there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were already testing the animal in
the forum because we already had access to
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I said, like the OGKB kind
of just fell into my lap as a result of
[SPEAKER_00]: like like an unfortunate incident in a
sense where I, you know, I pretty much I
[SPEAKER_00]: grabbed the clones and like those like
like out of OG Kush Red Spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, like I we we only knew
the animal in the forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, you know, when I got
the actual, I mean, the OGKB clone was not
[SPEAKER_00]: even it wasn't even named that it was just
more of I named it after OG Kush Red
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's my homie who gave it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like it's like it's like a
mutant cookies that actually is like
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking like, you know, like really good,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people are really curious as
to how you actually got your hands on the
[SPEAKER_01]: OGKB.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you be able to tell us the backstory
behind that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so basically, I mean, like OGKB is like
like I've known her for for a long time at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point is, you know, close to like
almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, he actually like he actually
like brought me in the game and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and he's always he's always taken care
of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at that time, we only knew of the
animal in the forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was an instance that basically
like one of his his spots had gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: robbed like like they it was like the home
invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was in I think he was in Vegas
and he called me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like like three, like three or
four, like four in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just he was like, yo, he's like,
can you go clear this spot out for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like, you know, pretty much it was
it got robbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hopped in in my girlfriend's car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was saying, like, you know,
at the time, I didn't have like a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grabbed my pistol and just, you know,
pretty much took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to make a bunch of trips back
and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty, pretty fucking pretty wild,
really, like to think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, whatever it is,
what it is, I got I cleared the place out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of plants that were
literally in like five gallon pots that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had to put in contractor bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and like, luckily, there was people
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like they, you know, once they were
like some of them were all tied up and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I once I, you know, got them loose and
whatnot, they were able to help me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was like driving back and forth with
these huge plants that were literally like
[SPEAKER_00]: five, six weeks in a flower and in like
five gallon pots and in my car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like basically what was
there was the OGKB is what we know as OGKB
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was it was it was pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so I got, you know, I got it taken
care of and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, like, you know, back then,
it's it was a different times as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: the legality of as far as what we were
doing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like that was, you know,
the cops could have came in at any given
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no I had no idea what the hell was
going on, but I just want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: everything out of there and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I brought that, like all the
stuff back to my house, I asked him what
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, this mutant ass plant,
like what like what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said it was cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was I was like, that's weird,
because we've already like been
[SPEAKER_00]: documenting the cookies as, you know,
as far as like what we know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a whole other phenotype of
the cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I finished it, everything up,
it was definitively like a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very, very good cookies cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't that desirable to actually
like grow because of the fact that like a
[SPEAKER_00]: veg so damn slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, that's pretty much what came
to be known as the OGKB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it wasn't even named that at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty much I named it after my
homie, like pretty much after him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was pretty much it just to like
differentiate the clones that we had
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What an amazing story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving you a virtual clap for being a
solid homie on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the first question is how does
OGKB himself feel about how the strain has
[SPEAKER_01]: gone on to become so popular?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he really doesn't seem to be
involved in the scene too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really get to hear his
perspective much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I mean, at the end of the
day, I mean, that's the reason why why it
[SPEAKER_00]: was named after him.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, like the the
recognition will kind of always go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is kind of crazy how everything has
kind of like, you know, snowballed into
[SPEAKER_00]: like what it actually is and how it's
actually very, very, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's a basis of a lot of like,
you know, one of the some of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: famous strains, I guess to date now,
you know, it's it's a it's a very unique
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, he's not really concerned with
a lot of that stuff, to be honest with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't think he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is just more of it's just crazy how it
all kind of like, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, just everything kind of
came into this whole situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it's a good plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it produces fucking fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The offspring is definitely like a lot of
it's very promising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like, yeah, there's there's
a it's, you know, I like it doesn't it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a finicky plant to get basically
dialed in and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, like at the end of the day,
to see where it's at now, as far as like
[SPEAKER_00]: if you saw like the healthy plants that I
have of the OGKB and that I even have it
[SPEAKER_00]: still alive is pretty, pretty crazy
considering the the the shape that it came
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great little turnaround story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely want to chat about the
offspring of the OGKB, but just as a quick
[SPEAKER_01]: little sidetrack, do you know much about
or have you tried the OGKB 2.0,
[SPEAKER_01]: the one that came from the bag seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that like a dark horse or?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure who it is, but like someone
bought some OGKB from a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_01]: they found like some S1s and they popped
it and it was like really good and they
[SPEAKER_01]: called it OGKB 2.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's even a few breeders who
breed with it, like most notably in-house
[SPEAKER_01]: has done a cross and he calls it OGKB 2.1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, at that point, I don't know,
like, man, I was honestly like people hit
[SPEAKER_00]: me up all day and they want to like they
want me to vouch for their for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: their their clone or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like, like I said, at the end of
the day, I just tell people like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yo, if you're happy with what you got,
like, you know, and it's fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, like, you know,
that's that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can't I can't, you know,
specifically vouch for for for your
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, what what what the weed
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are very quick to attach a name to
something that pretty much sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then in a day like like, you know,
it's kind of hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, at the end of the day,
if it's good, then, you know, it is what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like you got to give props
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have not tried any of those,
you know, like the OGKB 2.0 and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for me, it's just more of like I
have the original like like why the hell
[SPEAKER_00]: would I want to, you know, like experiment
with like trying something else and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, understandable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you started growing it out,
did you notice any similarities with the
[SPEAKER_01]: OGKB and any other plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I ask this is because
we've heard CSI in the past say that some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Urkel S1s come out with that exact
same morphology that mutant kind of looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at the OGKB has.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever grown the OGKB and just kind
of thought, oh, man, I see a bit of this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, yeah, the Urkel is very I
mean, it's a short stocky plant that was
[SPEAKER_00]: and which is pretty similar to the OGKB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, he definitely could be on onto
something besides that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only other one that I actually
noticed, like the leaf structure was at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time back then was was the cherry pie
that was going around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually like the cherry pie
tended to have hermaphrodite tendencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and back then it actually was it
was pretty similar in structure and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to kind of like that the leaf
structure and it was kind of short and
[SPEAKER_00]: squat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also tended to make like like like
like, you know, pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were they were non viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like but that's the thing is like it
was kind of like the cherry pie came first
[SPEAKER_00]: and then cookies started coming around
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like like it was I mean,
even I wish I still had that cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definitely that cherry pie was was,
you know, was was nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just not very, very stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got the OGKB.
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you first start to do some
collaborations with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like back then I I I met Fletcher
from Archive Seed Bank through through the
[SPEAKER_00]: forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it was just kind of like a thing
where I was like, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he was working with the face of
OG male at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so that was kind of like like the
basis of a lot of his his seeds and his
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company was kind of more like the
infancy stages as far as like it was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like just taking off and not quite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, you know, man,
like if you want to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hit like people were asking me left and
right for the OGKB because we had the form
[SPEAKER_00]: of the animal already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like the OGKB, once it became known as
like like like a very like legit cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, people, you know, people,
people were, you know, they everyone was
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hit him up and was like, you know,
if you want to pollinate it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just, you know, we'll split the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what became the dosidos
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like and from there,
it's just it's kind of progressed into
[SPEAKER_00]: like everything else that it is nowadays,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OK, so the seeds were made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you pop them immediately?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you really excited for it or you kind
of didn't really suspect it would go on to
[SPEAKER_01]: become what it's become?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, well, like a lot of the
seeds were like like they like the OGKB
[SPEAKER_00]: tends to produce very like white,
pale seeds that are typically non like
[SPEAKER_00]: non-viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they don't it's really hard to get
them to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I had like a jar full of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, I kind of actually held
on to like some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I gave them to I think was N.P.
[SPEAKER_00]: Callie, actually my friend, my friend Ryan
and Callie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he got actually the last of the
dosidos, the original dosidos seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were it was really hard to
germinate them and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, but, you know, that's that's pretty
much where the dosidos came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, I got the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started like doing the selections and
then pretty much like that, like Fletcher
[SPEAKER_00]: named it the dosidos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's that's pretty much
like where it's at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the MendoBreath is another story
as far as that was done with Gage Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, like it's it was like
like, you know, out of like a tray of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, I'd probably get like like less
than a quarter, like 25 percent of them
[SPEAKER_00]: that like actually germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're they're they're
definitely they require a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did the MendoBreath collab come about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was like like I had I had a
friend that was like that would that was
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a friend of a friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually mentioned to me that he
had some neighbors that I guess had this
[SPEAKER_00]: seed company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like like back then, same thing,
Gage Green was kind of in their infancy
[SPEAKER_00]: stages and in a sense that they were,
you know, they weren't that big,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they were definitely doing like
breeding work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, yeah, you know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was almost like, you know,
about like, you know, if if, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always about working with people and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, oh, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had talked to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they were like, oh, yeah,
I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know who you're talking about,
like as far as like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: me having the Oji Kush breath and whatever
and being on the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and so like I like we, you know,
we made an agreement and I gave them the
[SPEAKER_00]: clone and then they pollinated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there was the MendoBreath and the
GratefulBreath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, there was,
you know, that was those were probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: two most prominent strains that they
actually produced and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, but like they they
like, you know, like what like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that comes from the OGKB,
it tends to be pretty, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty, pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you feel that the majority of
their work now is just really stemming off
[SPEAKER_01]: the OGKB?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even further, you know,
Gromers now made his whole thing off their
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you've almost given birth to a brand
that's given birth to a brand,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you get what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's like the the base of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basis of the infrastructure for other
people's fucking companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's in a sense, it's kind of
flattering, but I'm not ever really one to
[SPEAKER_00]: be like a hater in a sense, you know,
like like at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way that this this industry is
like, I'm not going to try to go and like
[SPEAKER_00]: shake people down for, you know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just happy for people that they're
being successful with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, if you really
know what's up, you'll know that like the
[SPEAKER_00]: work came from me, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so there's always, you know,
you know, there there's always that sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of recognition in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, like,
you know, someone's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing well, like I'm I'm happy for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like as long as they're not a,
you know, a punk fucking like dickhead to
[SPEAKER_00]: me, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like like even like with Gromer,
I literally hit him up and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, like I wanted to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some like the peanut butter red.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked him for like a pack of the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, well, like 25 packs of seeds
of like all the shit that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I respect that, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure he's made plenty of more
money than whatever those are worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, like it's,
you know, it's I respect the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, he kind of paid it
forward, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always good karma stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people would know you because
through name, because the fact that the
[SPEAKER_01]: predominantly widespread cut of both the
Dosey Doe and the Mendo Breath are the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones you found.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you were doing those Fino hunts,
did you realize that these were going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be really good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I remember we just spoke about when
they were in seeds, but when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually flowering them out and you could
smell them and get excited, were you
[SPEAKER_01]: really excited or you just thought,
oh, this is a nice cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give it to some friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I could tell they were they
were game changers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like as far as like like how,
you know, how it's, you know, they've
[SPEAKER_00]: taken off or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, nowadays there's there's
definitely a lot of like like really good
[SPEAKER_00]: strains out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the time, they were definitely
like, you know, game changers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was definitely very
special as far as whatever I already had
[SPEAKER_00]: on deck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of blew everything else out of
the water, which is why I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you look at my Instagram or whatever,
you realize like I wasn't I didn't never
[SPEAKER_00]: intended to hype them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not like like I call like like like a
used car salesman where it's it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm not going to put my name on
something that's not going to be that
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, pretty much now,
like, you know, like nowadays,
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's a reason why people utilize
those strains for, you know, for for the
[SPEAKER_00]: basis of their other breeding projects,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this time, I think it was kind of
about the same time like look,
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies was just going through the roof,
you know, like you had like rappers
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to name drop it and the really
the cultural side of weed started to
[SPEAKER_01]: really generate a lot of interest in
Cookies as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever think to yourself I could try
to like, you know, jump on Dosedo or
[SPEAKER_01]: MendoBreath and try to launch it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you just feel like that was just
kind of not in your lane?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's it was I think like a lot of
the hype that came along with it was very
[SPEAKER_00]: organically fabricated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, like a lot of people
like would hear about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they like it's one thing to hear about
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another thing to like, you know,
actually have it and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like smell it and, you know, just like,
you know, smoke it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, but at the time it was,
you know, it wasn't it wasn't about like
[SPEAKER_00]: capitalizing on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all that hype really like I'm actually
very surprised as far as like how far even
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, like Cookies itself has
like come along, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's but but it was at the time it
was definitively like I can't deny that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was not I mean that it was a game changer,
you know, like it was just definitely like
[SPEAKER_00]: it like like said back then people were
passing around Bubba as Cookies and I'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, this ain't that fire, you know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I actually got a hold of the
actual like real Cookies, I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this is what people are talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually, yeah, like game
changers, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we try to put personal attachments
and whatnot to the side, if you consider
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that you conceded, you know,
it's not not a great breeding plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: the OGKB, and it's a bit slower overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you still think that it's worthy of a
title of like it's a good plant or do you
[SPEAKER_01]: think that it's just like worth the
hassle?
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, it's probably not really a
great plant, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, when I mean the flowers are I
mean, like whenever I have any of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's plenty of people that like
they want to run it into ice, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like ice wax or like, you know,
as far as like making it into hash or
[SPEAKER_00]: even, you know, just it's I mean,
it's sold always.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not necessarily the most
lucrative plant to to run when you're when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're when you're running, you know,
when you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but I mean, I always love having it
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's definitely very much a
really good a good plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like the offspring in itself,
too, is actually it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it holds a lot of weight as far as against
it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I kind of prefer to work with
the offspring as far as like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like the dosidos or even the OGKB
blueberry headband that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I just did.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those plants are going to be like
definitively a lot more like have more
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor and just be more like easier to work
with, you know.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess before we jump into the OGKB
blueberry headband stuff a little more,
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have one last question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any other plants which kind of
fit that category where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is a little bit finicky and most people
don't put in the effort, but you still
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it around because it's the killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I not really like honestly like
that's the one plant that I will always
[SPEAKER_00]: make space for in my in my bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there's like I hear like the
Mac one is like very similar and like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like characteristics as far as like
vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never grown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't say anything, you know,
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as just the OGKB, just it's
like, I mean, it's clearly it's a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: worth keeping around considering it's
notoriety at this point.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, you've never grown the Mac one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you're one of the few people to
resist the overwhelming hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I I know Cap, like if I'm sure if
I wanted to go grab a cut, I could go
[SPEAKER_00]: down, you know, see him and and,
you know, grab it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run like like some of his seeds and all
that stuff is just more of I'm not really
[SPEAKER_00]: one like the type of person to go out and
like like seek certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen flowers of the Mac one,
but yeah, it's just I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like I kind of just work with what I
work with because I'm already sifting
[SPEAKER_00]: through so much stuff as it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's kind of like it's I mean,
it's a good thing and a bad thing because
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's a lot of a lot of bullshit
that you have to sit through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like I like I have so many
seeds and things that I like crosses that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already made that I kind of like I
kind of try to focus on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got to ask, did you end up getting
into like GG4 or Skittles or any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other commonly hype ones of recent?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I literally just got a Skittles
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably like a like a month ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like like like I said, for me,
you know, like GorillaGlue4 was like I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to say it was that that's Josie's
like clone and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've ran it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just it wasn't it didn't it tended to
get over like overproduced to the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: where like it actually like the market got
kind of saturated with like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: GorillaGlue as a result of that because it
was a huge yielder and it was it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: that tough to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but Skittles and I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, I kind of tend to focus
on a lot of the stuff like that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: already doing myself as far as like,
you know, my my own work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's jump back into the OG KBX2,
which is the blueberry headband cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you hope to pair with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you plan to find a male from that
and then pair that with stuff or use that
[SPEAKER_01]: as the mothers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, with that one, I mean,
I like it basically was a cross that I
[SPEAKER_00]: made an outdoor cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I still have some seeds left
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can which I can sort through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, a lot of those seeds from the
original OG KB are typically not like non
[SPEAKER_00]: viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I like I said, I I I planted like
72 in a tray and I probably got like like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 14 or something like out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, you know, for me,
I still have I probably still got another
[SPEAKER_00]: like 20 or 30 seeds left that I can sort
through and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that OG KB blueberry headband was
definitely like, you know, as far as like
[SPEAKER_00]: what I wanted out of the OG KB,
it was it definitely like brought more
[SPEAKER_00]: vigor into it and also like it has more
like the blueberry nose on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's and like I said right now,
like compounds going to be working with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, I'm really more excited about
that whole situation, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and like see where that that that all
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you plan to get a few females
together and then he'll provide the male
[SPEAKER_01]: or do you know how you plan to do the
collab exactly?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I pretty much I made this
selection and then I gave him the like he
[SPEAKER_00]: saw the flowers and was like, oh,
damn, like I like he liked it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was like, you know, whatever,
like we should do like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess collaboration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, that's pretty much like
where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's I was like, yeah, if you want to
take it and like work with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: go like, you know, go ahead, dude,
you can do whatever you want with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's like I said, I don't know
exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't really discussed exactly what
he's going to do with it as far as like
[SPEAKER_00]: what males he's going to use to to
pollinate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I'm just excited that like,
you know, that that work is getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like is progressing and whatnot,
because I don't I don't I can't always be
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinating things, you know, considering
like, you know, my my like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like my the spaces that I have and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think that you'll ever open your
own seed company or do you prefer to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this sort of collab type thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of creation?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, honestly, like it's I mean,
like you said, I really would I like I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: rather work with people and, you know,
like I like the idea of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I think like collaborative minds when
they come together, they like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: like good stuff can come from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I'm not trying to be a jack of
all trades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I just like I like I
appreciate the fact that certain people
[SPEAKER_00]: are even willing to work with me and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm like, you know, as far as like
establishing a seed company, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather I'd rather work with somebody
that I already know and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: let them do their thing and then we can
figure it out from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but I'm not I'm not I just I
don't really don't have the time for that
[SPEAKER_00]: at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really perceive myself having
the time for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, with that being said,
what do you perceive is your future within
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you see it going and what do you
think your role will be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for me, like I like I'm pretty
tied up with like a lot of my consulting
[SPEAKER_00]: work as far as, you know, designing like
certain facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We you know, right now we're we just
submit our application to in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once that goes through and if we
everything is, you know, good with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'll definitely be busy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I just I just like growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like it's it's like I've always
like that, you know, like the plants and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as far as like working with them
and just just being around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's very like it's therapeutic
in a sense, you know, and then also the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that like certain you know,
like I would like to do more research as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as going into strains that are like
more medically like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have more like like medicinal
benefits and, you know, things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: as as far as like where, you know,
where they tend to help people out with
[SPEAKER_00]: like certain ailments they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like things like that,
like that's kind of what kind of drives me
[SPEAKER_00]: in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the medicinal stuff you just
mentioned, do you think that that will
[SPEAKER_01]: take you into the kind of CBD realm or are
you talking more of like just a regular
[SPEAKER_01]: THC dominant strain, but it just also
happens to help with X or Y?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I mean, I feel like the sky
is kind of the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds kind of like weird, but like
there's so much stuff we don't know about
[SPEAKER_00]: the like the cannabis plant at this point,
like certain compounds that we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: like discovering and seeing how they like,
you know, medicinally like how they affect
[SPEAKER_00]: people and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like I said, at the end of the
day, I'm just happy to to provide like a
[SPEAKER_00]: service for people if like if they feel
like the, you know, these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: these certain strains, you know,
medicinally benefit them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are there any conditions that are
maybe like close to heart which you'd like
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to work on or anything which
catches your eye?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just it's just a general topic of
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I feel like like like
cannabis is so subjective that it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when you when you smoke like
someone could smoke a sativa and tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a sativa and then someone else could
be like, oh that, you know, that same
[SPEAKER_00]: strain like kind of put me to sleep or
like they feel like it's more indica
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's I just feel like it's very
subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, if you know,
they're like like like said with any of my
[SPEAKER_00]: work or whatever can help anybody out as
far as, you know, like like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutically or like medically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just very it's it's very,
you know, like it's it's it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes you feel good in a sense,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned that you submitted an
application in Illinois soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, given we're dealing with kind of
this current corona uncertainty thing
[SPEAKER_01]: going on, how do you perceive that's going
to affect your work in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think everything will come to a
grinding hold or do you think the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry will kind of keep doing its
thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, it's really hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I know that that the application
deadline was extended by two weeks in
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois because of the whole corona virus
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's I mean, yeah, well,
they may extend it even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, like, as far as on the
application process, they were requiring
[SPEAKER_00]: people to submit the application itself in
person to like the office, I guess it was
[SPEAKER_00]: in Springfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and now they don't even want you to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I like I couldn't tell you to the
extent that it actually is going to affect
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it actually it has affected,
you know, somewhat are already like they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't they don't want to take any
applications from anybody in person
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to mail them in and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as like moving down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, who knows, man, with this with
this whole situation, I wouldn't I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't have a forecast that it would
even get to this point as far as like
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're at now or literally like we
can't, you know, can't leave our houses,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've heard a general sentiment from
a lot of notable Instagram figures saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, now's a great time to just spend
some time with your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like that's a good idea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I got nothing better to do,
really, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like like like really like hang
out with my dog and and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, basically like, yeah, like just put
some more work in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing else to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, typically there's other stuff to
to like, I guess, attend to or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at this point, we're not supposed to
leave our house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to kind of jump back for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there any certain point when you were
on the forums where you felt like you
[SPEAKER_01]: started to have like some kind of
notoriety, so to speak, or do you feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like that all came after that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, I still wouldn't tell you
that I have any notoriety, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm blessed to like be able to work with
the people that that I have and that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like that we have mutual respect
and some things don't always necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: work out with, you know, there's like,
you know, with with the people that you
[SPEAKER_00]: you deal with, but you live and you learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like I like I couldn't I
couldn't say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that we were doing a bunch of
like documenting as far as the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as far as the cuts that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, just everything is kind of
like I say, like snowballed into where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I like but I wouldn't I mean,
I wouldn't I wouldn't like to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to to, you know, to basically
accept the fact that like you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like that there's notoriety that
comes along with like the territory that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm in, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, ever humble.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was your favorite forums or did
you have like a favorite for a moment in
[SPEAKER_01]: general?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like ICMAG was good at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very convoluted and like
watered down at this point just because
[SPEAKER_00]: you have so many like new newbie growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was like it was, you know,
ICMAG overgrow THC farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, it was it was just a huge
like like like the huge like a library to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically learn like about growing at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were, you know, like I said,
like like me and like Ivan from the
[SPEAKER_00]: jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boys like lump status frostboss,
like an nonprofit like like AVF now like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that, you know, to have met
those people and and be able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: shared the knowledge that we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's kind of you can't really like
that's not going to like I don't foresee
[SPEAKER_00]: that coming about like again, like back
then we were like just super underground,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just basically starting out and,
you know, just sharing a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, like they said,
I kind of stuck to ICMAG and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was never about like gaining any
notoriety or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like really see when I jumped onto like
Instagram was when I noticed that like
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram was a huge marketing tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it was I was very surprised
at how like everything from there to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so it was like when I when I
set up like my Instagram handle,
[SPEAKER_00]: people were like recognizing me from the
forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, how like how do you know
about about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And and, you know, people had basically
had been following my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they were, you know, they were
like, kind of like, like, are you that
[SPEAKER_00]: person from, you know, whatever ICMAG?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was that's kind of what
surprised me a little bit and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you mentioned the marketing of
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you look at Cookie Fam now and feel
like they've done a pretty good job
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were to say that, who do you
put the like the kudos to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who out of Cookie Fam is the marketer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think Cookie Fam did
anything really.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like really see like Burner is the
one that actually hyped the strain like at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the day, like the strain
actually kind of held its own weight
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was like I said, Cookies was
definitively a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, I don't I don't you know,
I don't see how they did anything to like
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel that whole situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Burner definitely, definitely did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, like it's I
mean, it's kind of ironic, like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people assume like Burner is like a like a
weed grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, he I mean, he might have grown
weed back in the day or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he's more of a hustler in a sense,
which I mean, I totally respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but like, you know, like he he he's
the one that fueled the whole cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's you know, that's that's I would
say that's really who's responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: it, if not like Scherbinski like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's he kind of branched off and did
his own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he also had like the the you know,
the the the momentum from like the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookies thing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You read my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was going to be the next question was
about Scherbinski and how he branched off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I want to know is he's been name
dropped a lot in a lot of pop culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: like even in a Calvin Harris song,
which is pretty good for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like he's done a better job?
[SPEAKER_01]: And furthermore, what do you think will
happen to the Cookies brand if they
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to be passive, as you said?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's only so much that they
that that I mean, they can actually do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Scherbinski is definitely a lot
more of a of like a marketing type of
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know, that's fucking great
for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like said, I'll never hit on anybody,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But even like when he branched off from
the actual cookie fam and all that other
[SPEAKER_00]: shit like like initially, I was like like,
you know, I didn't I couldn't foresee how
[SPEAKER_00]: it was actually going to work out for him
and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's cool as dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, like he like,
you know, I'm very happy for anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: that's fucking making anything happen at
this, you know, in this industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's I mean, you know, he's he's
definitely more of a marketing type of
[SPEAKER_00]: person, you know, in the mix as far as,
you know, like branding and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, which is actually like it's it's
very surprising at how everything's come
[SPEAKER_00]: together nowadays as far as branding
within like the industry and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a lot like it goes a long ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would have never thought that
it would have came to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like it would be wrong to say
that Cookies, in a sense, was the root of
[SPEAKER_01]: where all this bloody branded Mylar bag
comes from, if you like, kind of really
[SPEAKER_01]: think about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, not not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, it's Cookies is the basis
for pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even the like the dose,
like dosidos, like whatever, it all it all
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stems from from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're just like a burner base.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he has a platform to basically
promote this like that strain and he has a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge following.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and as a result, it kind of it's like
a trickle down effect to where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, anything associated with it can
actually, you know, be very, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: worthy of recognition in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, like like I said,
like, you know, Sherbinsky as far as like
[SPEAKER_00]: him branching off and doing his own thing,
like he does have, you know, very
[SPEAKER_00]: prominent strain that are like pretty well
known in the industry, like under under
[SPEAKER_00]: his belt and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, like I like you can't deny
the fact that like Cookies literally is
[SPEAKER_00]: the basis for a lot of the stuff that's
going on now in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that you can reduce it all
down to like Cookies and TK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I mean, I mean, I feel like
the TK is more of a connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like market, most people would not know
what like what the TK is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, but I mean, like all the hybrids
are like have those two components in them
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's yeah, I mean,
it's like, yeah, I would not I would not
[SPEAKER_00]: argue with that that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, like I said,
Cookies is I mean, there's a reason why it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a game changer in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was definitely like when I first saw
the actual Real Deal Cookies, I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this shit is actually fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the only other strain that I could
attribute that to would be like the OG
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, like the like the original SFV or
the Larry that that was around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then and also like the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like back then, like nobody had like
purple strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of crazy to see.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you make of the Sherbets and the
Gelatos when they first came out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they impress you at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly, like I didn't I didn't
I'm not I'm not the person to like go go
[SPEAKER_00]: and seek out these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it comes across me like like then,
you know, I'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually like the people that I deal
with, they they are they're they they're
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they they hold some weight in
the industry in a sense where like I would
[SPEAKER_00]: trust that whatever they had was legit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like at some point, everyone wants
to kind of pass whatever they have off as
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sherber or like Gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's you know, they're they're
good strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like but like, you know, like I was I
didn't even have any idea that the the
[SPEAKER_00]: Gelato like there was the different
different types are basically just
[SPEAKER_00]: different phenotypes of the same,
you know, I guess like seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, yeah, I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, the Sahi and the like
whatever other like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypes there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all kind of all based off the same
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, like that, I mean,
they're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't I can't deny that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm a fan of the old 41.
[SPEAKER_01]: But have you seen what the Cookie Fam are
doing now with their like their collab
[SPEAKER_01]: with JBZ and the mints thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have seen that like in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like there's definitely like a lot
of good strains coming out of that out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that camp in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like I said, at the end of
the day, like I wish nothing nothing but
[SPEAKER_00]: the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the same boat where I'm always
looking for something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hope that everything works out,
you know, like for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's there's when money
comes into play, a lot of bridges get
[SPEAKER_00]: burned sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, but I mean, they're
they're doing good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope everybody's getting compensated
and everyone's getting paid and making
[SPEAKER_00]: money and, you know, be able to take care
of their family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sentiment we've heard echoed by many
different people over the past few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that everyone's so hyped over like
these new school things, but people don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really give enough credit to how some of
the old school strains were really
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you kind of feel like you're into that
mentality or are you not really
[SPEAKER_01]: subscribing to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like I love old school strains,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the problem is they're just not like
necessarily available anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and like a lot of the new stuff is
definitely like very, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's a lot of like nice stuff
that's out, like nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like to be able to have
like like, you know, some land race
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that are, you know, you know,
from back in the days, it's just not
[SPEAKER_00]: really it's it's it's very few and far
between the lights to actually come across
[SPEAKER_00]: them, especially like the legit ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's there's a yeah,
there's like there's certain like there
[SPEAKER_00]: was like the Pepper Fino Romulan that I
like is very like for me, like very
[SPEAKER_00]: nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like probably a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even think about them right now at
the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but like things like that,
you're probably not not going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: across them again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pepper Fino Romulan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only really heard of a Berry one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there was a great one, but there was
also a Pepper one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I actually brought it back from
Amsterdam when I when I came back,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from the Cannabis Cup and like
it was like 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and yeah, like I brought back the
seeds and there there was I know I know
[SPEAKER_00]: the great, you know, was that was one of
the one of the more prominent ones as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as like that was went around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was also the Pepper Fino that
was very like kind of like spicy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, yeah, like like I said,
at the end of the day, like if I had it
[SPEAKER_00]: today, there's you're probably not you're
going to get more money for things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are a lot more hyped up like like JBZ
stuff or, you know, gelatos or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sherbards and all that stuff,
you know, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's more of a personal preference
to run them and, you know, keep them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you pop new seeds, do you like to
delve into some old, some new or you find
[SPEAKER_01]: it's fairly much the new?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like as far as like like as far as
what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like if you're going to do like a
Fino hunt, just kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: look through some new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's it's for me,
like it's I mean, there's a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets the that ends up, you know,
you have to sit through a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit to get to the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's just kind of like the
reality of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but like when I'm selecting like
males or, you know, like crossing into
[SPEAKER_00]: certain females, you know, it's all like a
matter of selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you never know exactly what what's
going to come about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, if you put your
best foot forward, you usually will get
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you know, like, you know,
something worthy of keeping around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, too,
everyone gets tired of shit like after,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you run the same strain for like
a year, year and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are going to get tired of it no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that popping new seeds is
really kind of a vital thing to the scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's honestly like as far as like like
like, I mean, the longer you keep a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: alive, the more of an instance it has to
actually become, you know, diseased or
[SPEAKER_00]: like have like a like like some sort of
like pest infection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I guess if that's what you want
to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like seeds are are, you know,
definitely, you know, like if you
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly are are popping seeds and
looking through stuff, which, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the end of the day, you have like you
have to sit through a lot of bullshit to
[SPEAKER_00]: get to some good stuff sometimes,
depending on the stability of like like a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, like you're going to
always have like new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea of always having something
new to like look forward to, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's not always going to be like not
everything's a winner, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, OK, I definitely feel like we've all
had our fair share of junk seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that kind of same vein of thought,
when you are popping seeds, do you
[SPEAKER_01]: subscribe to this idea of like maybe
popping a certain amount?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, if I gave you five
seeds, would you be like, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not really enough to do a good hunt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you just whatever's there is there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I mean, if someone give me
five seeds, I'd just plant the five seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, you know, beggars can't be
choosers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense, but like I mean, it's
definitely nice to have like more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: like like a broader spectrum to like
select from and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like you can also,
you know, you can't find some some winners
[SPEAKER_00]: within five seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like like I said, it's definitely nicer to
have like like, you know, a lot more to
[SPEAKER_00]: choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, at the end of the day,
you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like, you know, like at the end
of the day, I'm probably going to narrow
[SPEAKER_00]: it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: To probably like a few phenotypes,
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then toss everything else like it's
it's it's easy to get like attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to keep certain things around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, it's just like
you have to realize like like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: always going to be something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to keep looking, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you do a pheno hunt, do you like
to run the keeper, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a clone a few times before you rule at
the keeper?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you feel like you've got a good idea
from the first run?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I find people different opinions
on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, you have to like like
like, I mean, it takes a little while to
[SPEAKER_00]: dial the strains in because they all have
like different, you know, like nutritional
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements in a sense, as far as like
like, you know, nutrients and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, so your first round may not be
like you're not going to hit it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, out the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, you know, you'll get a decent
idea of what, you know, what it can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce and what, you know, what not if
you get a pheno that's super, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: larpy and like has like a like,
you know, like like a bland smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably I mean, I probably am not
going to run it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like there's you can definitely see
the potential in certain strains as like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like when you grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, you know,
most of the time, like I can tell within
[SPEAKER_00]: like the first round, like what's going to
be worthy of like keeping around and and
[SPEAKER_00]: running it again and trying to dial it in
better as opposed to just like wasting my
[SPEAKER_00]: time on keeping the mothers for,
you know, certain genetics that are not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be, you know, that like,
you know, worthy of keeping around in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a bit of a hard question to answer,
I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what to you makes you want to keep a
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, do you have like a certain baseline
and you think if it doesn't meet the
[SPEAKER_01]: standard, maybe like a common plant,
you just refer everything to and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, it's not better than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not keeping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how do you try to define what's
going to stay and what's going to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just a hunch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, realistically, I mean, it comes down
to a matter of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after like most of the stuff that I'm
going to select is going to be stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like I'd like to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then as I'm sorting through new stuff,
then things have to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the bottom line,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, you know, like there's if I
have unlimited space and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, too,
it's it's always nice to start from new
[SPEAKER_00]: seed stock and have like new genetics and
like, you know, everything gets old no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's ironic how like now certain
strains like are literally like vintage
[SPEAKER_00]: strains in a sense of you call like,
you know, things they're like like like
[SPEAKER_00]: the the trends are cyclical in a sense,
even with the weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's it's you know, like like said,
some people like nowadays they'd want
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, oh, man, I wish I had like
this train wreck or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just kind of like that was,
you know, around a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to come by nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like said, it's just it's
ironic how things are very like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the trends are very cyclical,
even within like the cannabis market and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, it is very cyclical,
like with a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't asked you yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on FEM seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you ever make them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like I personally wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually running some first time right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I got like that's that's going to
basically be the basis for for my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, on that, I typically wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that like back in the days,
like like there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic like tendencies that could
come about from like the feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like from what I know now,
like I'm running some of like like like
[SPEAKER_00]: like from ABF genetics, some of his are
like feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I trust his judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm running them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I like I probably wouldn't keep
mothers for longer than maybe like a like
[SPEAKER_00]: a few rounds as far as taking clones off
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just me, you know, herring on
the side of caution as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally like back in the days,
hearing that like they tend they tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: have her hermaphroditic tendencies after a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I could be completely wrong,
though.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to clarify, you're saying if you
found one you like, you'd run it a few
[SPEAKER_01]: times, but you'd probably give it up after
a while because it probably start to harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that I mean, I can't say that that's
that's what would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more than likely, like in my
experience, back like back in the days
[SPEAKER_00]: before things were like a little more
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's kind of what was the
consensus at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things I mean, people, I mean,
even like auto flower genetics and like
[SPEAKER_00]: feminize auto flower like like like
everything's gotten, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people have definitely dialed in things a
little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, like it's like I
couldn't I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, I've always like like
back in the days, there was always kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphroditic tendencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as like back then, people would
typically run feminize seeds and for like
[SPEAKER_00]: one round and then, you know, move on to
the next round of like like new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like I said, like this is
literally like the first time I'm running
[SPEAKER_00]: feminize seeds and we'll see how it all
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I trust, like I said, my like my homie
Brian's judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he tells me there should be
a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's, you know, that's why I'm
running them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: To hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep my eyes on your Instagram to see
the updates just as a quick follow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other packs of seeds or
breeders that you're kind of excited to
[SPEAKER_01]: run?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, there's there's tons of
stuff out like, you know, like on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, I like I'm very fortunate to
know like a lot of, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, very like good breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I see them, they they'll throw me
down seeds and they, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always very, like, very grateful
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and like, I mean, I already know,
like, they do really like really good
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like there is, you know,
there's a lot of prominent breeders like
[SPEAKER_00]: Canorado, Swamp Boys, like Sea Junkie,
you know, like like OBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm going to forget certain people
at this point, so I don't want to,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, offend nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there's there's,
you know, I'm very fortunate to,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, like, know, you know,
know a good amount of these people and
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, like, like I said,
be able to run some of their gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, you know, they all do good
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some really big heavy hitters in the list
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another heavy hitter you mentioned early
on was M.P.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I can guess what type of grow
style you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my question is, do you use M.P.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carly Pro Nutrient Mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, actually, I do not at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like I I use perfect grower and like I
like I, you know, they're they take care
[SPEAKER_00]: of me like they they, you know,
like the nutrients are are dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, we have very good success
with them, you know, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, Ryan is is is my homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I wouldn't, you know,
like I would not shy away from utilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: his stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also more of at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of like, you know, we were
already used to running the perfect grower
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like like Ryan's he's a brilliant
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's he's his product, I'm sure,
is like really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like maybe like, you know, maybe like
further down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, at the time when I was
making the transition from like my like my
[SPEAKER_00]: old formula, like which is based off,
I think it was like a cutting edge like he
[SPEAKER_00]: he hadn't he hadn't gotten his nutrients
like like, you know, on deck yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so, yeah, that's why I went with the
perfect grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like everything as far as
for me, it's just more of like if it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: broke, don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have really good success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but, you know, I got nothing but
respect for Ryan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's a he's a really good friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't didn't mean that in,
you know, kind of throw you onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: busway at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome to hear that there's some
other good brands out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess kind of on that topic,
are there any other products which you
[SPEAKER_01]: think are really solid products just
lifted your game happy to kind of throw a
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out to them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, like like everyone that that
like pretty much messes with us,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, as far as like like from the
lighting is as far as like lux lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, from my homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, you know, jungle boys like the
deal I likes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We utilize both of those, you know,
the floor flex.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like Aaron at floor flex.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they he definitely takes care of
us at a troll master, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Miami Mango.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, that's like, you know,
that's they like I just appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody, you know, coming together,
you know, like the camaraderie that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: along with like like you know,
like as far as people taking care of each
[SPEAKER_00]: other or not, they all they all
definitively, you know, they like I'm very
[SPEAKER_00]: fortunate to to be in the position to
where like I have their phone numbers and
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's any issues I can always call
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, like, I mean, it's you know,
they they're like, you know, I'm very
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful for all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of big hitting names just mentioned
that I definitely want to get into some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the nitty gritty of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, people are going to be
super interested in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's like tell us about your
relationship with Ivan of the Jungle Boys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we just we came up from the from
the forums and whatnot, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like he was one of the pioneers as far as
like like, I mean, he he taught me how to
[SPEAKER_00]: literally like set up a pump start relay
and irrigation controller for over a drip
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when we didn't have access
to any of this information, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so it's it's it's just crazy to see
how everything's kind of progressed as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as to where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, whatnot, but he's he's
definitely like a pioneer within this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's he's he's he's a smart guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not fucking he's, you know,
he's he's definitely he's definitely not
[SPEAKER_00]: not I mean, I'll say not stupid,
but like I'm saying, like, he's a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: smart guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect the shit out of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was more of just like like a
relationship within the forums that we
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that's, you know, that's kind of
where we all came up from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as far as I said, like maybe if
Frostboss, which was actually yes for Prop
[SPEAKER_00]: 215, I mean, on ICMAG, on nonprofit,
like, you know, like all of our homies,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's it's crazy to see how we all
kind of came up and and we're at like
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're at now, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely seems that when you talk to
all the kind of more notable names in the
[SPEAKER_01]: scene, there is a common thread,
especially in the early days, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: nice to see that, you know, the people who
associated together in the early days
[SPEAKER_01]: putting in the work, it's kind of
translated on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, it's it's like I said,
it's really crazy to realize like how
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's fabricated as far as like our
success and and, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's kind of like like we all kind of
took up a trade that was, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're very underground at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's like it's like a trade
that literally is in very high demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are like, you know, we're getting
paid for our experience as far as like how
[SPEAKER_00]: many fuck ups we have.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you also mentioned the Troll automated
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel that that's going to be the
future of growing with these really
[SPEAKER_01]: tightly regulated automated censoring,
which helps keeps things in control?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, I like the idea of it,
but like you also always like like like
[SPEAKER_00]: like I remember when like there's there's
a thread, I want to say it's on I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's on THC Farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like it's weird how I actually
remember this because it's so long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Ivan from Jungle Boys, he had
mentioned that like he had it was like one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the threads as far as I think he was
setting like an irrigation controller up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, you can automate this,
but like I still like to go there and push
[SPEAKER_00]: the buttons and literally like make sure
everything's getting watered
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it's good, but it's also,
you know, you have to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain things like mechanically
that like that can definitely like fail on
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they do like depending on how big
of a setup you have, like it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: catastrophic as far as, you know,
like like you know, things don't get water
[SPEAKER_00]: or there's certain clogs and like certain
irrigation lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you always want to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But automation is definitely nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to have the ability to to to
like, you know, to have access to these
[SPEAKER_00]: products, because back then we didn't like
we had to pretty much kind of like come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with the ways to to do what we needed to
do with what, you know, in our industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the products weren't readily
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had to like you had to incorporate
other products from other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: To actually, you know, like like get what
we wanted to get done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that in mind, what do you see as
the future of more large scale
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just it really depends on like
what what you're going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's a you're going to have
like your Budweiser's where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that like people still buy
Budweiser, but there's always also a
[SPEAKER_00]: market for like craft beer and like the
same thing with like with weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I think for me, I'm very much into
like exclusivity and having that like
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, not not, you know,
not necessarily having whatever whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else has access to or has.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, too,
I mean, I like, you know, people love to
[SPEAKER_00]: clown on Purple Punch or Blue Dream or
Green Crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know that I got homies that have
dispensaries and they like people love to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy those trains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's it's it's you know,
it's just a matter of like what what
[SPEAKER_00]: people want, you know, like what like what
the market dictates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of something I've been thinking
about for a long time is the Budweiser
[SPEAKER_01]: analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good one because I think people
understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you on a personal level be a little
bit bummed out about if we use that same
[SPEAKER_01]: analogy, you know, Budweiser makes a lot
more money than a lot of, say,
[SPEAKER_01]: craft breweries that are making a really
high quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that same analogy holds true in
cannabis, is it a bit disheartening or is
[SPEAKER_01]: it just a whatever thing to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at the end of the day,
I mean, like like like it's I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's commercial growing versus like,
I guess, more like craft growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, like once you
commercialize something like especially
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture and whatnot, it usually always
is going to lead to like a degradation of
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I mean, but most people are like
like I always say that there's like the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer market and the connoisseur
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them, it's a very thin line as
far as like discerning, like whether or
[SPEAKER_00]: not this weed was grown commercially or or
like, you know, like or someone who grew
[SPEAKER_00]: it like, you know, 10 lights or versus
like 100 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, it's it's like I said,
it's it's pretty subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time, like the majority of
the market is going to be like consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily connoisseurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of people, it's crazy to me
that they will literally like buy stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: without even looking at it or like,
you know, like like I just I can't I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't buy something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as like going to a store and,
you know, like like not being able to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the product, like that's why I like
even like delivery services.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I like I don't, you know,
it never really like like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like struck me as far as like a lucrative
business in a sense, because I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: who the fuck would want to buy something
that they can't necessarily like see or
[SPEAKER_00]: smell or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, it's I mean, clearly I was
wrong.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get down to some of the neat
gritties of growing itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of medium do you like to grow in
and what's your how would you describe
[SPEAKER_01]: your general style?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I just try to keep things as
sterile as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like I like using I mean, Rockwell is
just kind of like a generic term in a
[SPEAKER_00]: sense, because there's so many other like
brands it's but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've I've done pretty much everything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've ran every single medium you
possibly could deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done like water cooled lights at one
point, which was a disaster, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: a medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just saying like, you know,
I I tried everything on it like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, everything that is pretty much
like like is is tribal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and I kind of settled on the Rockwell
because I had my most consistent yields
[SPEAKER_00]: and and, you know, like product to come
from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's it's it's it's it's sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I said, I've done
cocoa, I've done beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at the end of the day,
like Rockwell was just kind of like what I
[SPEAKER_00]: did best with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so is there any little tips or tricks
you might have for our growers in regards
[SPEAKER_01]: to how they can produce a better quality
and bud, just general ideas or product
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like there's a very negative
connotation that comes along with
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell, especially Rockwell with with
salt based nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will always, you know, the soil
growers, it's like a never ending argument
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're going to they're going to,
you know, tell you that like it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to taste this way or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, I feel like a
lot of that is somewhat subjective,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and I mean, it's it's
definitively subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, you know, at the end of the day,
I actually feel like I've I've I've smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: organic, you know, soil, which I like,
I definitely like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on a commercial scale, it's not
necessarily like feasible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's like when you're talking
about like minimizing your not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: like just your cost, but as far as like
like labor intensity and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like Rockwell's like if you you
know, it can be it's a lot easier to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like every time you buy it,
it's going to be sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no pots you have to sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like after every round, you know,
dirt, all that stuff can become very like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, labor intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about being lazy either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just more of like, you know,
I I like the idea of having everything
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of, you know, like like just like
streamlined and, you know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's yeah, it's it's like I like I
said, I've done cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, like I couldn't
there's very few times that I've actually
[SPEAKER_00]: been able to discern the difference
between, you know, like something that was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in Rockwell with salts that's
flushed properly as opposed to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like soil that's organic soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned earlier that you like lux
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they the ceramic metal highlights?
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that we have are actually we use
the CMHs for our mother room in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everything else is like Doolin and
like HBS is so like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we're basically we run DLI
and we also run Red Lux.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like they're both, you know,
they're both good brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both take care of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I appreciate the shit out
of like, you know, both those companies.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what type of temperatures and
humidities do you like to run your flower
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms at?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the flower room is typically like
I like to keep right around like 80,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe like the low 80s as far as we're
running like like CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people they're going to
like they want to follow like the VPD
[SPEAKER_00]: charts, which they I mean, it's not not a
bad idea, but like those charts,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not necessarily tailored for like
cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like they're kind of a
generalization for like like like
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cannabis, like you can't run that high
of a humidity like according to the VPD
[SPEAKER_00]: charts like that later in a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, you know, it's kind of like
you kind of take it with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, take what you want from it and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I usually run everything at like 80
and like the humidity is always going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be like between 50 and 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's your kind of basic outlife,
your dry and cure process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I find this is an area people are
always kind of looking to learn more
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, honestly, it's it's not it's really
not that not that difficult in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: where we pretty much we cut we cut at the
base of the stock, hanging on a hanger and
[SPEAKER_00]: having it in a climate controlled room,
like a dry room that's like going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: about 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you want to keep a little colder
just because you like the cold tends to to
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibit the growth of like mold and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and and like the humidity just like
right around like, you know, 50,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, basically like 50 percent,
like 60 degrees and just let it do its
[SPEAKER_00]: thing for, you know, two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, everything gets
trimmed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, like we like I
designed this this we call like a can of
[SPEAKER_00]: cellar and for our place in Oklahoma with
where we have like the cure tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from, you know, we're not throwing them
in like turkey bags directly after we like
[SPEAKER_00]: like after everything gets trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're literally we're throwing them in the
tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, they can kind of cure
like, you know, as long as we want until
[SPEAKER_00]: the product actually gets gets gets gets
bought by the by the distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you feel that will be the future
for a lot of brands getting out of the old
[SPEAKER_01]: turkey bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't like the idea of of like,
you know, just trimming your, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: your your buds and just throwing them in a
turkey bag like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to I mean, you can literally
see the trichomes getting, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like like sticking to the actual turkey
bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you if you open open up a turkey bag
like, you know, like after everything's
[SPEAKER_00]: been trimmed and, you know, like thrown
thrown in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I just I just don't like the
idea that, you know, you're going to smash
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's at the end of the day,
it's just, you know, like it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: matter of doing things like as best as we
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like I like I like I love
the idea of having that that that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: seller, you know, like pretty much taking
everything from being trimmed and not
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing it in a bunch of turkey bags and,
you know, throwing them into the cure
[SPEAKER_00]: tubes and letting them cure in there from
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to kind of jump to a different
topic, I forgot to ask you earlier between
[SPEAKER_01]: the Do-Si-Do and the MendoBreath,
which one do you like more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, like I like them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: They it's I would say the Do-Si-Do is
probably going to be like a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: indigo dominant, but the MendoBreath is
like, you know, like if you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: run it outdoors, like the Do-Si-Do is very
I feel like like it's very reminiscent of
[SPEAKER_00]: of like more of an OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: The MendoBreath, though, just like stacks
like if you I mean, I have homies that
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll pull down like 10, 12 pounds off
of like one single plant outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the Do-Si-Do, it's going to be
pretty tough to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's like it's probably doable,
but that gets it takes less effort to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it with the MendoBreath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and like, I mean, yeah, I like they
both have their own like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: place in as far as like what what I,
you know, what I like them for or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, you know, the MendoBreath
definitely will yield a lot more for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that the if you're looking
more for an indigo effect, your the
[SPEAKER_00]: Do-Si-Do is probably going to be your best
bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So often when we talk about OGs and chem
dogs and things breeding, I often talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: guests about what pairs well, generally
speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your mind, do you feel as though
there's something which generally speaking
[SPEAKER_01]: pairs well with cookies?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's nothing that I like
necessarily prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain like cookies crosses that
I definitely have like been impressed by
[SPEAKER_00]: and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I like, you know, when you
take two things, it's I mean, for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just very interesting to like pretty
much see what comes about from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from the cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, the Do-Si-Do is basically
like a remade cookies, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like a, you know, like as far as
that, when it's the Do-Si-Do cross the
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles, I forget what the actual name of
the of the strain was that I want to say
[SPEAKER_00]: Fletcher made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so yeah, like it's it's it's
definitely I mean, you know, like when you
[SPEAKER_00]: take two like really good things,
you usually will come out with something
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty damn good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but they're like, you know,
like I'm still like experimenting with
[SPEAKER_00]: that as far as like the breeding,
like things with the OGKB, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: like stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like certain projects that I'm
looking forward to, like down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to be a little while before
we before I get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, let's talk a little more
collaborative stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your affiliation with Colt
Classics?
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to use a lot of your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I like I mean, Marcus is basically
like someone that was introduced to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like we like I like say
it's kind of the same thing as far as like
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else that I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave the cut and and, you know,
like he bred it to like a like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a bunch of like whatever like
males that he had and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of let him do his thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you know, like whatever,
like he like I unfortunately like I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really hear too much about his
company at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but, you know, like like there was
certain things that came out of like those
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding projects that were like pretty
like very like very promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I remember that ultraviolence
thing he did was pretty popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that the cement shoes, you know,
like there was definitely a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: promising stuff that came out of out of
those breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I was like for me at
the end of the day, it's just it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very like it's exciting to see what comes
out of these crosses and these are these
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinations and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So someone we've spoken about a few times
already before has been flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned he's a good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the question is, do you have any
collaborations in mind or do you think
[SPEAKER_01]: that it'll happen in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, yeah, I mean, I'm always like
like eager to work with him regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I respect the shit out of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, he has OGKB.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, you know, he's free to pretty much
work with it like however he wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said at the end of the day,
like I trust his judgment as far as what
[SPEAKER_00]: he's going to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got excited to see what what would come
about from from that whole, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone wanted to get their hands on
some of your work, what would be the way
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's in the future, you know,
what do you think will be the best way for
[SPEAKER_01]: him to get it through a seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bank or maybe through a clone bank?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I said, that's why I kind of
let other people handle that, that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say I've had multiple offers for
like all sorts of stuff where people are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they, they, they want to carry
like, you know, like whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the, you know, the crosses I make and
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, that's not
really like, I would say it's not my
[SPEAKER_00]: specialty, but it's just more of like,
I'd rather leave that up to like somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else and have them take care of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just like, you know,
work with somebody else and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: do like the collaborations and have them,
you know, take care of all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as far as like facilitate like,
you know, the liquidation of all of like
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds and all that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm sensing here is that you're
actually given a message to all the pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: chuckers out there being like,
guys, making the seeds isn't the hard
[SPEAKER_01]: part.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the other bit I don't want to be
involved with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's, I mean, it's,
I mean, selection goes a long ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what takes the longest time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, but like, yeah, for me,
it's just more of like, I like working
[SPEAKER_00]: with people and, and like, like,
you know, like seeing what, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, it's exciting at the end of
the day to see what can come about from,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the work and the collaborations that
can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really like, like, you know,
a lot of people are very, they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep everything in house and, and not work
with other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this industry is very ego driven and,
and I think that's kind of what will hold
[SPEAKER_00]: some people back at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I said, I'm like, you know,
like I decide at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I think just kind of everybody eats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever, if we can all help each other
out, let's make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned people contacting you
about stocking your things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even earlier in this episode,
you, you mentioned Dark Heart Nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a notable nursery that definitely
sells a lot of the Mendo breath clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like honored by that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like, how do you feel when there's
places stocking kind of your work directly
[SPEAKER_01]: or indirectly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, at the end of the day,
like, like I said, if you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the, like, not necessarily like
the lineage of like, of the genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like, you know, a lot of the times all
that stuff is kind of associated with me
[SPEAKER_00]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, in a sense, yeah, like kind of
honored, but at the end of the day too,
[SPEAKER_00]: like they, like I said, when I released
the, the, the, the clones of those,
[SPEAKER_00]: those are the Mendo breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were some of the first people to
literally line up to like grab them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They paid for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do whatever they want with it at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not, it's, uh, like,
you know, I can't hate on, on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on them at the end of the day,
like it's, it's a, like all the,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the, you know, the, the notoriety that
comes along with those strains kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you know where they came from there,
it's going to come back to me anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, like I said
before, like I'm more than happy for them
[SPEAKER_00]: doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually just, uh, identify like the
hop, uh, I think it was like the hop late
[SPEAKER_00]: and viroid, um, issue with like plants and
whatnot, like, you know, like they,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we, yeah, years ago when we
were, uh, when we were growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was that that's pretty much what we
called it was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they actually were able to lock it
down and then, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, identify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I respect that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool as fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it probably didn't cost them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably cost them a lot of,
a lot of money to, uh, to retain the
[SPEAKER_00]: people to actually, you know, do the work
to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to get your pin on this
situation then.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel when people, like,
I guess kind of do what Groma did,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, grab someone's strains and like
just F to it and sell it or just run with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that fit into your same philosophy
where like, you know, you're not really
[SPEAKER_01]: going to hate just whatever, or do you
feel like at a certain point you draw a
[SPEAKER_01]: line?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's nothing you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, why, well like why lose
sleepover?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's, uh, at the end of the
day, it's like, if, uh, if, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I can, in a sense, I feel like I helped
somebody out, you know, and, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want to utilize like my,
my work to like further yourself fucking,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when, when people want to,
uh, to like, you know, like if,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if someone wants to mouth off and,
uh, and, uh, and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like, uh, you know, like I said,
like with him, I literally hit him up and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yo, like I kind of wanted to
get a pack of like peanut butter bread and
[SPEAKER_00]: he sent me like 25 packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I respect that, you know,
he doesn't owe me shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so at the end of the day, like I
respect his work.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's done good work based off of my stuff,
but that's kind of just, like that's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of what, you know, par for the course as
far as what comes with the territory and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can't, you can't control that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, like at the end of the
day, uh, I mean, if he was a dick and was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, like, like, you know,
like one or like, you know, like talk shit
[SPEAKER_00]: to me about, you know, whatever,
when I asked him for some seeds and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: a different story, but he was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He fucking, you know, I, I, uh,
I respect that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just re yeah, I just realized I
hadn't actually asked you, what was the
[SPEAKER_01]: story with gauge green?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that end?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was just, it's so, I mean,
it was just more of a, like, like that
[SPEAKER_00]: was, like I said, me, like me and
Fletcher, like people want to think that
[SPEAKER_00]: like, uh, they're, you know, think like I
got rich off of, uh, the whole dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like situation or whatever,
but like our original agreement was
[SPEAKER_00]: basically to make the cross and split the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so, you know, I respect the shit out
of Fletcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, like he's, he's a good
friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'm, I'm very like, uh,
you know, I'm very happy for him and like
[SPEAKER_00]: his like success as far as like,
like the, you know, the, the, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed lines that he's running,
like now we're not based off the dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like all that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with them, I, we actually had a
contract where there was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like, you know, like I was supposed to
get compensated for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds that were sold and things just
got kind of like convoluted and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, didn't necessarily work out the way
they were supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, I like, I, I know,
uh, I guess like he play and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mike and, um, and, uh, like,
you know, like we're cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not like, there's no bad blood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just more of like, they, they,
you know, like they, I mean, they,
[SPEAKER_00]: they definitively like defaulted on our
agreement, put it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but at the end of the day,
there's not much, you know, else,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an industry where like,
I can have my lawyer contact you and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and sue you for, you know,
whatever.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think that, more contract based
collaborative project will be the way
[SPEAKER_01]: going forward, or do you hope not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, no, like, like everything I do,
like even like with, with compound,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, uh, like, you know, our,
our agreement was like almost like 30
[SPEAKER_00]: pages or something, you know, like my
lawyer put it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, that's, I mean,
at the end of the day, it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, it, I mean, it's, it's, it's,
uh, like, it's, it's just, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry is very, it's not very like,
uh, mature in the sense where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually like, uh, exercise these rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day too,
it's like, I just, I'm, I just feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: it, like I'm over the whole like handshake
shit and you know, like, uh, like those
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of agreements, like if everything's
written down on paper and at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, uh, like someone defaults on it,
um, you know, then it's like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's like, it's, it's, it's clear as
day as far as like, it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's all written down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we agreed on and that's
pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned earlier that,
um, we bumped into each other at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your feelings on the Emerald Cup
and on the cups in general?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel the general vibe of them
is going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I mean, what's ironic is actually like
a lot of people, they, they, they consider
[SPEAKER_00]: the Emerald Cup as, as like being like a
very, like, I guess, like a, like a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a custody, um, uh, expo or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and like this year was actually the
first year where people were actually kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of more, uh, they responded to,
to like going to the Emerald Cup and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, cause like everything else actually,
like high times, all those, all those
[SPEAKER_00]: other shows are just like, you know,
they're, they're, they're garbage,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I mean, you know, I like,
I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the idea that it's only,
uh, for outdoor growers and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, things like that,
but whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I have fun, you know,
attending those things, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing, meeting people like you and,
you know, like conversing with people
[SPEAKER_00]: that, uh, that, you know, like that are
like very prominent with the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, um, it's, uh, it's, yeah,
it's like, I just, at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like having like, even like MJ BizCon,
like I don't go there for the like actual
[SPEAKER_00]: conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I go there to have,
you know, see every, like all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: homies under one roof and literally just,
you know, like converse with them at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's nice to have everybody
under one roof and, and, uh, be able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, converse with them and,
uh, you know, talk business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I was also lucky enough to bump
into at the Canna Illuminati party.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing to me, which stands out about
the Canna Illuminati party and also things
[SPEAKER_01]: like the ego clash is that we're seeing
the rise of these kind of more smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: boutique events, because some people are
losing a bit of faith in the bigger ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what do you, how do you feel about the
smaller, more boutique ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, at the end of the day,
like it's, uh, I mean, if there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always, I always, uh, like I always like
to see, like what people have to offer at
[SPEAKER_00]: these sort of events and whatnot,
you know, like there's a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so like the, the, I mean, the bigger ones
are, you know, I would say they're
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a little bit more, uh,
like watered down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's nice to have, like,
see the up and coming people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, literally like trying to
like make moves in the industry and that
[SPEAKER_00]: are like, you know, doing like really good
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's really where you're going to
see it at most of the time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, as far as like the up and comers,
like, you know, at the, I like the bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: events, you're going to see the people
that are probably a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: established, which is, is dope as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, it's like, you know,
there's always, like I said, something new
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up and like, you know, like it's,
it's, it's always interesting to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: other people have to offer, you know,
especially the underdogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the last things I wanted to ask
you about before we get into the quick
[SPEAKER_01]: fire questions is the concentrate
takeover.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't heard so much news about it
recently, but for the longest time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the rise of the vape pens,
the issues with them, the way it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, kind of taking over the market,
the casual consumer, just totally just
[SPEAKER_01]: having an insatiable appetite for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you sit on the concentrates
taking over the market debate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I mean, it's, it's, uh, like,
like I, I don't mind like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, uh, like a nice, like, uh,
like dab, especially like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if it's ice wax or, you know,
like, uh, like sauce or rosin,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if it's good product,
like, you know, uh, I'd like, I definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: like enjoy it and whatnot, but you know,
as far as like the pens and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, it's, I just feel like it's,
it's more of a matter of, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: accessibility and like, uh, like,
uh, being very like, like inconspicuous as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as, you know, that's why there it's,
it's a lot of it's very popular and like
[SPEAKER_00]: other, other States that may not be so,
uh, so privy to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like legalization and like things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, uh, but at the end of the day,
like it does suck that there was a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: issue with the, the vape carches that,
you know, we're all tainted and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and you know, like people were getting
sick from them and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, uh, like, you know, but I like,
uh, good concentrates are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at the end of the day, like really
like it's, it's, uh, it's, I think it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more healthier, uh, you know,
than actually like smoking, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like flowers and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, uh, you're smoking, you know,
at least you're smoking, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, like the majority of it's going to be
THC as a, as opposed to like a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: foliage that, you know, like you roll up
and you smoke, but I still like smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: like weed, you know, that that's that I'm
just kind of old school like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's jump into our last quick fire
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first one, indica or sativa,
which one for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, it's, uh, it's like it,
like everything has its place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's, uh, like I can't,
I can't necessarily tell you, I prefer one
[SPEAKER_00]: over the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain sativas that are going to
be like panic attack inducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, there's also like, uh,
like, you know, certain indicators are
[SPEAKER_00]: good if you're going to try to go to
sleep, but, but, uh, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially at this point to like
nowadays, I mean, everything's been
[SPEAKER_00]: hybridized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, uh, it's, it's kind of,
you know, tough to say exactly like what,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, what I would prefer in a sense,
but everything has, it's a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's time and it's placed as far as if I
wake up, uh, I'm not going to want to take
[SPEAKER_00]: a dab or, uh, or, uh, or, you know,
smoke a joint of like some heavy indica,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, obviously like a sativa
probably better to get my day going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but at the end of the day,
if I'm trying to go to sleep or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, like an indica is probably going to
be your, you know, your, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: your best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, like I can say
too, it's, uh, a lot of it's just very,
[SPEAKER_00]: just very subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just all like everything
has a time and a place and you just got to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So flower or concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly, like, I like flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I feel like the concentrate game is,
um, is so new that like, we don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't know the negative repercussions
of, uh, of like, like even with the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing with the cartridges as far as like
smoking and concentrates and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are certain, uh, there's certain
ones that are definitely more pure than
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but, uh, like, yeah, I mean,
I'm just, I'm super old school in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sense that I like, I like smoking flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the conversation with a few
people before where it's like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's just everything like certain
things are just so new that we don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going to, you know, like we won't
know exactly how it affects people as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as their health until probably like 20 or
30 years down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so if you're smoking cartridges,
like all day and, um, and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, like, you know, people are still
going to weed, you know, flowers for
[SPEAKER_00]: forever at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, like we'll know more or less,
you know, the, the consequences of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking, you know, other, other things
like, it's like, you know, butane
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted, uh, concentrates, uh,
cartridges, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I said, we won't know until,
you know, like I said, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: years before we figure out like what
exactly, what, um, like how, like how it
[SPEAKER_00]: affects people in like their immune
systems and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of the following three strains,
you have to pick one to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one is it Mac, GMO or Skittles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I mean, I mean, you can't really go
wrong with either of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would, I would probably say,
uh, the Skittles really like the Mac to
[SPEAKER_00]: be, to be honest with you, like reminds me
a lot, like I've like kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Bubba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's, it's, it's, it's a very good
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I tend to like more of the fruity
stuff to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so like, yeah, like Skittles is
definitely, you know, uh, probably,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the GMO is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's definitely super gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, I think I just have like,
uh, some sort of affinity as far as like
[SPEAKER_00]: not wanting to smoke it just because
really like it takes so long to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's a longer, like flowering
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a personal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, like, yeah, like Skittles,
I like, I like, yeah, I like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely like, I was definitely
impressed with the Skittles when I,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I saw it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you saw it or when you tasted it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean both, but I'm saying as far as
like, when it like literally when I,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I actually saw the real deal,
you know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of all the weed you've smoked ever,
what's been the most memorable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I mean, like, like I said,
there's that, that pepper fino of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Romulan and then there's, uh, uh,
the, like, like the blueberry headband
[SPEAKER_00]: that I like, that I crossed the OGKB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like there's like a certain,
actually like I saw like a, what was it
[SPEAKER_00]: like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like a blue diesel when I
was actually in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I was actually pretty impressed
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, it was like super frosty and I,
I didn't get to smoke it though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as like, you know, looks wise
and like, uh, like, you know, like the,
[SPEAKER_00]: like terpenes and all that, it was
definitely, uh, it was, I was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but, uh, but for me, like it,
like the one of the most memorable,
[SPEAKER_00]: memorable strains realistically is going
to be like, so there's like the DJ,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I, I'm just very, very like,
uh, like very, um, I like a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry strains for that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, like the DJ short blueberry that
I had in like Amsterdam, like was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very nostalgic to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, like the blueberry headband that I
had, like I've only had like a few times
[SPEAKER_00]: it was very like, yeah, like it was,
it was, uh, it definitely stood out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the other hand, what was a strain
which really kind of took off with other
[SPEAKER_01]: people, but you were just like,
man, I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, like everything kind of has
its, uh, its place as far as like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like for smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that are going to talk shit
about, like said, blue dream, verbal
[SPEAKER_00]: punch, um, you know, green crack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like I, I, at the end of the day,
I'm actually like pretty grateful to have
[SPEAKER_00]: this selection we have nowadays because
what music you know, what I smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, 15 years ago or whatever
was, you know, a lot of the stuff was just
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, uh, like, you know, like there's,
I mean, like, yeah, I've definitely,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I mean, I've, I've, I've smoked out
of fucking out of like, uh, aluminum cans
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that where it's,
it's kind of like, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, uh, taste is kind of irrelevant at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, like, you know, like,
like I've definitely had my fair share of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking up, like a lot, you know,
a lot of bullshit really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's, that's, you know,
most people that used to smoke back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: days, like, you know, they, they,
uh, like, yeah, there was definitely a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff that was going around that was,
you know, just, uh, like not, not like
[SPEAKER_00]: what we have this selection of today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God we are where we're at now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lucky last question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could go back in time, any place,
anywhere in history, presumably to grab
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds or maybe a clone, where would you
want to go and what would you grab?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, uh, I mean, it's,
it's always nice to have land race
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, I mean, but at the end of the
day, it just depends on what, what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I know that like, you know,
like, like, uh, to go to Africa and get
[SPEAKER_00]: like some, like, you know, some driven
poison seeds, um, you know, like any of
[SPEAKER_00]: those land races like that, like the Hindu
Kush, uh, like things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are, you know, like, you don't,
you don't see that anymore, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, like to be able to go, it's like go
and like acquire those genetics would be
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like, you know, at the end of the
day though, we actually have a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: selection here in California, just not,
uh, like it's like, obviously not
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's going to be like a land race
genetics coming from like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like South America or like Africa or,
you know, um, like the middle East and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, uh, it's, it's, it's hard to say
actually like what I would actually want
[SPEAKER_00]: to, uh, like what's on my, on my,
uh, my hit list as far as like what I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to, like what I want to acquire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certainly a lot of choices in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with that being said, do you have
any shout outs or comments you'd like to
[SPEAKER_01]: make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I mean, I mean, not really,
man, just, you know, fucking, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful for like everybody that,
you know, like, uh, that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: has worked with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I got a lot of, like, you got to
weave through the bullshit to get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: real people sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, very grateful to have
access to like, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, knowing a lot of people that are very
prominent with the industry and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and uh, and that, like, I respect a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I have my, my crew out in
like Oklahoma city that they, they,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they stay crushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, you know, like I said,
like, like Ivan from jungle boys,
[SPEAKER_00]: love status, my boy frost boss,
Brian, uh, unknown profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my homie, uh, like Garris that helps
me out over here is my homie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, he's, he holds it down when I'm,
when I'm gone, all the goddamn time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He watched my dog and stuff for me and
honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, uh, you know, like, it's,
you know, I'm just, I'm just very
[SPEAKER_00]: grateful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm blessed to be able to, uh,
be associated with like a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: people and, uh, and be able to like absorb
their knowledge and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: share it, like share what we've learned
within the industry with it over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of the last, like 15, 20 years.
