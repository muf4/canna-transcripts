[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you guys are excited for that final
three out of three part hitter from
[SPEAKER_00]: Chimera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people over the years have
expressed concern to me around the idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: the development of such a strain whereby
it's approximately the same height,
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, profile, terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got all these traits on lockdown such
that a big combined harvester can just
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest a field of it perfectly,
and it just goes through to production,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fear that gets expressed with this
sort of end outcome is that we could lose
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic diversity if these populations
were to hermaphrodite or to put pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: out, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that that is a legitimate
concern, or do you think that it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: akin to the way there's corn and then
there's heirloom corn and they both still
[SPEAKER_00]: exist?
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetic diversity for me is a concern for
every species on the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis being one that I've chosen to be
a custodian of, hell yeah, genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity is a hugely important thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that everybody needs to practice
good, we need to be doing open populate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever I do a population, for example,
when we did the blueberry stuff with DJ,
[SPEAKER_03]: we grew all the stuff and we just let it
open pollinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't do a lot of seed from it,
but we let it all get a little bit of
[SPEAKER_03]: seed, and all that seed got bulked
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you've got everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: That goes in a freezer somewhere,
or a fridge somewhere, or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: into your long-term germplasm storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you start working from the clones of
the individuals and creating sub-families.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first step is the open pollination.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first step is the preservation of the
genes in the pool, because it doesn't stop
[SPEAKER_03]: you from doing any other type of breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to open pollinate the whole
thing and collect all the seeds from all
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants, and then you've got it all
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to do that for another 25
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can take the one clone and make
seeds from that one plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you've got an inbred version of your
population and the breadth of the genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: diversity in another population in the
fridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a crucial part of if you're
serious about germplasm preservation or
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic preservation of a crop,
that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You preserve it, and then you improve it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you put the preserved stuff in the
freezer, and then you can improve the
[SPEAKER_03]: line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then if you want, you can go back to the
original population, or cross the new line
[SPEAKER_03]: to the old line, or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your options are limitless.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you didn't do the preservation,
you can't go back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, hugely important for all plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And definitely people need to start
thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is making uniform seed going to compromise
the genetic diversity of the species?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so, because again,
you might be able to make that new line
[SPEAKER_03]: where all the plants look the same with a
small subset of your population.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as long as you've got that genetic
diversity that you've preserved in the
[SPEAKER_03]: first place, you're not really losing
anything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to jump back one question,
you raise a brilliant point and one I've
[SPEAKER_00]: actually kind of struggled to navigate the
minefield of myself in that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people in the community use like the
incorrect sort of nomenclature around
[SPEAKER_00]: certain topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my suspicion is that it arises from
the fact that a lot of growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: genuinely very inquisitive and curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they try to look into things and
often words get used in the wrong context
[SPEAKER_00]: because maybe there was never like a
formal education around what it's used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often it leads to just people like
myself using the wrong terms just so that
[SPEAKER_00]: people kind of understand what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question becomes, do you think there
ever will become a sort of formalized
[SPEAKER_00]: nomenclature around cannabis and like an
effort to set it straight?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I specifically
reference this is because we're seeing a
[SPEAKER_00]: shift with seed seeds instead of being
called S1s, people calling them R1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether that's correct or not,
it makes me realize that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to think about this sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's R1 reversal?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's silly because that's silly
because it's S1 means self, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, after you have to reverse one
plant, but that plant that you reverse
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't make the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a weird thing to call it
S1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's actually kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's actually a good way to make
this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis world kind of likes to be on
its own.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question that you asked was,
will we ever get to a standard point in
[SPEAKER_03]: time where everybody uses a strict set of
terminology that's correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there is a whole strict set of
terminology that's correct and the rest of
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant world uses it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for some reason, stoners don't,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's no fault of our own.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, when somebody teaches you
something the wrong way and you we all
[SPEAKER_03]: learn it and we all think that it's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden, one person
learns that, hey, we all learned it wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty hard for the rest of the
people to come back and turn around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So words like strain, sativa, indica,
like all those words are used wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I even used it earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used the word Kalecs.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no Kalecs.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis doesn't have Kalecs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis has Brax.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, when and I'm not blaming Rob,
but Rob in marijuana botany, he misused
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these words.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, he learned them the wrong
way as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was taught them the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not trying to put any blame on Rob for
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's dive into the sativa indica thing
for a second here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's start with indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indica means from India.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's there's other plants that are
from India and they're like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: metacago indica, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like indica means from India.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you look at plants from India,
the cannabis plants from India,
[SPEAKER_03]: what are they like?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're equatorial.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got long, thin leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we call those plants sativas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sativas, sativa means useful or
cultivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Latin for it's kind of got a by
meaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like useful or cultivated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peas are Pissima sativum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, that sativum is the same root
word, which means useful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So somebody had taken a plant out of that
collection and found a use for it really
[SPEAKER_03]: is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they cultivated it in out of the wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like the process of taking it
out of the wild and and putting it into
[SPEAKER_03]: into your own domestic cultivation is is
what the word sativa means.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the plants that we mean to be the
plants that were first described by
[SPEAKER_03]: Linnaeus to as cannabis sativa were hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't drug cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hemp plants have narrow leaves and
really tall stems.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are the so what are the wide
plants then with the wide, the really
[SPEAKER_03]: short, stocky plants with the super wide
leaves that we call indica?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're actually Afghan.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're Afghanica.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we call what we call indica is
really Afghanica.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we call sativa is really indica and
sativa is really meant for hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that might sound all interesting and
everything, but like, how the hell are we
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get everybody to get on board and
understand that that's what it is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, even yourself, you're like a
highly informed person in the space and we
[SPEAKER_03]: still use these terms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not trying to, you know,
make you feel bad or dumb about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I run into this like every day
with people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like everybody I interact with,
it's like, oh, this is a sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the word strain, the plant
people that do the name, the naming of
[SPEAKER_03]: plants in the world, they kind of oversee.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like an organization that kind of
develops the taxonomy and the names for
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't use the word strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strain is simply reserved for bacteria and
viruses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can have like covid-19 as a strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the reason it's called the
coronavirus that we call covid.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason is that it has that name,
is that all individuals within that family
[SPEAKER_03]: that came from a common ancestor,
since it's spread all over the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's undergone all these mutations in its
genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's actually no longer one individual
genetic type reproducing itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's become like a hairball of all these
different genetic types that are
[SPEAKER_03]: reproducing themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason that we all call them you know,
the covid strain, a coronavirus or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever, is that they all induce the same
phenotype in humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is the coronavirus disease or covid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, people that are using the word
strain should stop if, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you're calling what you refer to as a
strain, like, for example, blue dream is a
[SPEAKER_03]: specific clonal type that has been
selected from a population.
[SPEAKER_03]: And every plant that subsequently comes
from that clone or from mother,
[SPEAKER_03]: mother plants of that clone, that should
be called a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, cultivars don't necessarily breed
true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as long as you propagate them through
clones, the traits that we refer to that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the traits that we named,
we have or somebody has named blue dream,
[SPEAKER_03]: all of those traits are consistently re
they consistently come from the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you're taking cuttings of it,
OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you then cross that plant to itself or
one member of its family and all the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants came out again, identical to blue
dream, that would be called a variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a variety is a seed family that
reproduces a type when you inbreed it
[SPEAKER_03]: through sexual recombination.
[SPEAKER_03]: A cultivar is a plant that maintains its
type when you reproduce it through clone.
OK?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think cultivar is the word that
people mean when they say strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's probably not enough true
cannabis varieties yet for that to really
[SPEAKER_03]: be too, too relevant to most people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pinot noir, for example, it's a clonally
propagated plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a strain like you'll never hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you hear it occasionally,
but the plant people would never call it a
[SPEAKER_03]: strain.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's kind of why I lean away from
words like indica and sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I try to tell people or I try to I try
to use the words.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can do a sudden example by using these
words myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of try to use the word
equatorial for what you've been referring
[SPEAKER_03]: to colloquially as sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Afghanica, I think, is the best
word for indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, Linnaeus, the guy that did this
work, was, you know, whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: over 100 years ago, well over 100 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when the drug cannabis growers
started getting into cannabis and call it
[SPEAKER_03]: the late 50s or maybe 60s and 70s,
that's really when the words sativa and
[SPEAKER_03]: indica appeared in our pop culture
vernacular or even our cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_03]: vernacular.
And.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty understandable that they went
and read the scientific literature and
[SPEAKER_03]: decided, oh, look, this plant is tall and
it has thin leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably sativa without realizing
that Linnaeus was describing a hemp plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: not a drug cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same with the indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, it becomes hard when everybody
is using the words to mean different
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's again, it's like we're talking with
Terps and we don't have a consistent
[SPEAKER_03]: agreed upon definition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got their own definition of
what these words mean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So someone says, oh, I got a strain of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what what what's a strain?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask them what a strain is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, watch them try to figure
out what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a strain, a strain, when it
reproduces, it should always reproduce the
[SPEAKER_03]: type.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you breed a cannabis to a cannabis
plant to itself and it's a cultivar,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a hybrid cultivar.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you breed it to itself, it falls
apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: The kids no longer look like the mother.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a real problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: The seed market, because some dude gets a
cutting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we'll stick with Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some dude gets a cutting of Blue Dream and
he's like, I'm going to make a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: money or he or she thinks they're going to
make a bunch of money making seeds from
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they take one copy of the clone and
they reverse it with their STS and take
[SPEAKER_03]: that pollen and put it on their their
other plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they put they harvest all the
seeds and they put them in a bag and they
[SPEAKER_03]: label it Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those seeds go off to the seed vendor
and he puts them on his website and puts
[SPEAKER_03]: them in a package that says Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you grow the seeds out,
they look nothing like the parent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the word Blue Dream becomes
meaningless.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, again, it doesn't, you know,
the net goes out onto the market and some
[SPEAKER_03]: guys, he finds a plant that's totally
different from Blue Dream and he's selling
[SPEAKER_03]: in his market as Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the public has no idea what Blue
Dream even means.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you go into a grocery store and
you buy a Macintosh Apple, and you're in
[SPEAKER_03]: Vermont or Australia or like London,
UK or Amsterdam, it's the same Apple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's it's been registered as a
plant variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they get that when you when that
process happens, that's when you get to
[SPEAKER_03]: put the name on the plant and you get the
commercial rights to the plant and the
[SPEAKER_03]: name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other dude can't come along and start
like selling an apple in his backyard as
[SPEAKER_03]: Macintosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because eventually everybody gets to know
the flavor of the Macintosh and they
[SPEAKER_03]: realize, yeah, that's Macintosh.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Granny Smith.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's honeydew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people learn these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, we don't have that kind
of standardization in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you actually have to be of a certain
level in the business with access to lab
[SPEAKER_03]: testing and, you know, a bit of a snob
like a Somalia kind of snob person to to
[SPEAKER_03]: really understand the differences and be
able to pick up a plant and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the other thing, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sort them by chemical type.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, you know, I like to complain
about these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, I mean, really, the only reason I
complain about it is because it needs to
[SPEAKER_03]: become a talking point before people are
going to do anything about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to have some, you know,
that was one of the things that I did when
[SPEAKER_03]: we were working down in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: The company that I was working for gave us
a really quite significant budget to go
[SPEAKER_03]: and buy all the weed that we could find in
the state and run it through our lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: And through the process, we were able to
start seeing, OK, everybody agrees that
[SPEAKER_03]: this is sour diesel, except for these
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got something else they're calling
sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: The entire market agrees that this is blue
dream, except for these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got something else that's blue
dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can start making you can start
linking a chemical profile that that is
[SPEAKER_03]: discoverable by a lab assay that means the
type.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, a good way to think about it
is like if Tom Cruise has kids,
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't call them Tom Cruise and start
telling everybody that the kid is in Top
[SPEAKER_03]: Gun.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's like it's just that we all
agree that the words Tom Cruise or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever word you want to use is a symbol
for a type.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that symbol and that type should
remain constant from group to group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: For it to be a real thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, what people are doing is
they're just trying to slap a population
[SPEAKER_03]: or name on a different variety to sell it
and fool the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, what that does is it just
confuses the market in the long term.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then nobody knows what anything is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's one of the shortfalls of
cannabis.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like maybe I'm a way nerding out on
about too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it would be really great if
everybody understood that this certain
[SPEAKER_03]: smell profile is sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_03]: This certain smell profile is what we call
blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some really good food for thought and
a little something I'm going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep in mind going forward, trying to use
the right terminology, because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a huge advocate of that's how
things get very muddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've certainly told a lot of
people when they make some S1s,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, make sure to say that it's an
S1, you know, like otherwise you have that
[SPEAKER_00]: same problem you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to jump back to something we were
talking about earlier with the the A77
[SPEAKER_00]: Cali Orange, I just wanted to ask,
there is this prevalent idea that exists
[SPEAKER_00]: broadly around, I guess, all orange
strains, but maybe it stems from the Calio
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is so widely used and it's
like, you know, a common ancestor for a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the popular ones at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've worked with it and you've made the
Calisar and the C+.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your experience, do you think that
there is a link between that orange
[SPEAKER_00]: profile and a lack of potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people speak as though
you just can't get like an orange flavored
[SPEAKER_00]: strain that hits you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the way an OG does.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes and no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the long answer is no.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason is, is that like,
like I kind of mentioned to you off camera
[SPEAKER_03]: or off recording.
[SPEAKER_03]: Scent or smell is a heritable,
heritable characteristic.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's a trait like every like
anything else, and it's probably a series
[SPEAKER_03]: of traits that all appear as one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And usually when you have traits like that
on a given chromosome, they kind of get
[SPEAKER_03]: stacked in one part of the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so chromosomes during copying,
they break apart and they can switch.
[SPEAKER_03]: People were talking about the blue and the
red chromosomes before for mom and dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: When that, when that child from,
you know, from mom and dad has it goes,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's making sperm or eggs or pollen,
those pieces of chromosomes can actually
[SPEAKER_03]: change little pieces of information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you might get like a majorly blue
chromosome with a little tip of red and
[SPEAKER_03]: correspondingly a majorly red chromosome
with a little tip of blue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they do exchange little pieces of
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: The probability of those genes that are
inherited on that same little chunk
[SPEAKER_03]: getting separated, like the closer two
genes are on a chromosome, the more likely
[SPEAKER_03]: it is that they'll be inherited together.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's less chance of a crossover
happening at that part of the chromosome
[SPEAKER_03]: between those two genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it can happen.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really low probability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you say it's THC and orange,
you know, are they linked to be that there
[SPEAKER_03]: is no THC?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no higher potency orange stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it takes a lot of breeding to get to
that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a phenomenon called gene
linkage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people can look up on Google gene
linkage or even on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there's videos gene linkage and
gene linkage maps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's ways that you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you if you score traits over many
generations and you very diligently record
[SPEAKER_03]: the traits and the occurrence,
the number of times those traits appear on
[SPEAKER_03]: a set of plants on the population,
you can actually start to figure out how
[SPEAKER_03]: close together sets of genes are on the
chromosome.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're using genomics or molecular
techniques, you can actually do it a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: more quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the idea is that you want to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might be that the orange flavored
genes are very close on the same
[SPEAKER_03]: chromosome to a version of the THC gene
that doesn't work very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we need to do is we need to
take that piece of the gene for the orange
[SPEAKER_03]: sorry, the piece of gene for the mediocre
THC production and switch that out for a
[SPEAKER_03]: gene that is that makes THC, but it's very
effective at doing its job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's called breaking the linkage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the closer two genes are on a
chromosome, the harder it is to break the
[SPEAKER_03]: linkage between those two alleles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, again, these are all things that can
be solved with plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it really takes doing like a cross
with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to cross probably you'd want to
cross something like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: an orange plant to a high THC plant like
cookies or OG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you grow the F1 and you let them
all breed together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next generation, you want to grow
like, say, 50,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you grow that many of the next
generation, you have a higher likelihood
[SPEAKER_03]: of finding the plant that has all the
orange flavor, but also the high THC
[SPEAKER_03]: production or the high cannabinoid
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just plant breeding and
numbers.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Luther Burbank used to grow hundreds
of thousands of plants looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, I think he selected the
russet potato out of like 100,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that he kept two plants from
100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a chore and it's serious.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like, man, you want to make those
improved plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now when you've done the work,
now you've got an orange plant that is
[SPEAKER_03]: high in THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it but it takes a lot of work to get
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you certainly can't do it in a closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we have genomic tools,
you know, they can definitely aid in the
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they also have a cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're still paying however many dollars
per sample to have every plant genotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, the good news is that the new
ones, like, you know, some of the sherb
[SPEAKER_03]: and the new things, they're they're orange
and they're a lot more potent than the A77
[SPEAKER_03]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually had a question from one of
our viewers submitted about like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are your thoughts on the occurrence
of like the supposed like one in a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand phenos?
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, they kind of reference
this idea of every now and again for the
[SPEAKER_00]: most part, you'll see most plants having
just lots of characteristics of the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents, some blended, some leaning more
towards one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every now and again, maybe you call it
a one in a thousand phenos, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a plant that's almost unlike
either of the parents in any regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like this is a real sort of
phenomenon that occurs or maybe it's
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen contamination?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think these one in a thousand
phenos will be more sought after given
[SPEAKER_00]: we've kind of discussed them a bit and how
there can be advantages to finding these
[SPEAKER_00]: special occurring plants?
[SPEAKER_03]: They can be better than the others,
but they're not necessarily better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when people are talking about the
one in a thousand, it's really most often
[SPEAKER_03]: about, you know, it's like you said,
you get traits from mom and traits from
[SPEAKER_03]: dad.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, did you get all the right traits
from mom and all the right traits from
[SPEAKER_03]: dad?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one in a thousand kind of material.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that you might see,
I think what you're hinting at is there
[SPEAKER_03]: are these very rare genetic combinations
that lead to an altered phenotype of some
[SPEAKER_03]: type.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason that they're rare is that
again, it's really it up with with
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's again, like I said, it's statistics
and math.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all comes down to just having the right
genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have all the right combinations
of genes, then you can get an aberrant or
[SPEAKER_03]: a stranger and new phenotype that was
unseen in either of the parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that all is based on probability.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really just rolling the dice over
and over and over and over and over again
[SPEAKER_03]: until you get the right combination of
genes together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, it seems like a good point to
segue into some of the more advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: science and IP stuff we're going to chat
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first question I have in regards to
genes and the way they line up,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you, to the best of your knowledge,
know if CRISPR or any kind of molecular
[SPEAKER_00]: editing has been used to create altered
cannabis varieties?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe so.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might have been done somewhere in some
lab, but CRISPR is not as easy as
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody thinks it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't just dip a plant in CRISPR
juice, for example, and the whole thing
[SPEAKER_03]: comes out changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these genetic changes, they happen on
a single cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that single cell has to have
integrated the new trait and that single
[SPEAKER_03]: cell needs to become a new plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when that single cell divides and
divides, you have what are called,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you get a clump of cells,
you get what are called sectors in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those sectors might actually,
like you might lose the CRISPR mutation or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever the CRISPR change is caused.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now you've got a plant that is
growing as a chimera, like it's actually a
[SPEAKER_03]: plant with multiple genetic types within
the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what you need to have is a plant that
is all one genotype that all incorporates
[SPEAKER_03]: the, you know, the new CRISPR mutant
version of your altered gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you grow, how would I explain
this?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you grow cannabis plants,
it's not like the shoot that comes off of
[SPEAKER_03]: a plant, it's not a single cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an organ, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not one single undifferentiated cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like all the cell types are already
organized in a way that they know what
[SPEAKER_03]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the equivalent to people can think
about in humans, if you've got,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the cells in your heart are
heart cells, they're heart tissue cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cells in your lungs are lung tissue
cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: The nerve cells in the back of your eye
are eye tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cells, they're all highly specialized and
differentiated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now any cell type can revert to what we
call stem cells and plants have
[SPEAKER_03]: equivalents of stem cells, um,
which is, you know, more or less callous.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's really like a, a D
differentiated cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cell that started as an organized
group of tissues and it went back to the
[SPEAKER_03]: cellular level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you do that and you get it down
to the one cell, now you can make your
[SPEAKER_03]: CRISPR changes on that one cell,
but you have to grow it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Out into a full plant that is re
differentiated into the proper types.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that doesn't just happen
spontaneously.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you have to, there's protocols with
different chemical and hormonal
[SPEAKER_03]: applications that you have to get that you
have to go through to re differentiate a
[SPEAKER_03]: stem cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, it's like,
if you want to take a stem cell from
[SPEAKER_03]: someone, you take skills, cells out of
their skin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you, you put them through a genetic
program and it makes them back into a stem
[SPEAKER_03]: cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's like, the progenitor cell that
can, can become heart tissue or eye tissue
[SPEAKER_03]: or lung tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so depending on what you want that
cell to do in the end, you have to coax it
[SPEAKER_03]: along that genetic pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So your little baby stem cell grows up to
be a heart cell, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can take those heart cells
and coat them on some kind of like matrix
[SPEAKER_03]: so that they grow into a piece of tissue
that you can actually transplant into a
[SPEAKER_03]: heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, um, you don't want to put
lung cells into a heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a whole science that nobody
has figured out to my understanding that
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody's figured out in cannabis to really
go through that process of single cells to
[SPEAKER_03]: differentiated tissue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, when they go through that
process of re differentiation,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's something called soma clonal
variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and again, you can look that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's soma clonal S O M a, and then the
word clonal variation and that's genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: variation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or epigenetic variation that stands upon
the genotype.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and that can actually cheat through
something called DNA methylation that can
[SPEAKER_03]: either silence genes or over express
genes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the result of those things may be that
the plant that actually comes out of that
[SPEAKER_03]: form of tissue culture is not the same as
the one that went in regardless of the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic change that you made.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that for now, listen,
it's going to happen at some point in
[SPEAKER_03]: time, somebody will make, you know,
CRISPR cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't, I don't believe it's happened
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, typically you make those kinds of
alterations in, in species that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that are already ID or mostly ideal,
but you just want to fix one trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there isn't the natural genetic
diversity that is present in the species
[SPEAKER_03]: for you to be able to go back and select
those traits through breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's a, it's a, it's a shortcut.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a really cool technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super neat that we can, that we're at
the point in time that we can do that now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think that anybody has to
worry that that's happening with cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: at the moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It will come one day, but I don't think
that we're there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a really comprehensive answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we jump to the other end of the
spectrum, you know, as, as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the, the quote experts using genetic
modification, let's talk about the novice
[SPEAKER_00]: for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be your advice to someone just
starting out on the right way to breed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be any tips or sort of
principles you would recommend they adhere
[SPEAKER_00]: to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Genetics for dummies.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd get yourself a genetics for dummies
textbook, understand a basic plant
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding textbook, or even a basic biology
textbook that teaches meiosis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, meiosis is the dance of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: That goes on, like I said earlier in the
forming of the cells that become sperm,
[SPEAKER_03]: pollen, eggs, and, you know, um,
ovules and plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that genetic dance is more important
to the breeding process than anything
[SPEAKER_03]: else, because if you understand how it
happens, then you understand what's
[SPEAKER_03]: possible and what's not possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you have that knowledge, you can add
on cannabis knowledge on top of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you only become more informed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the vast majority of books on cannabis
don't do an adequate job of talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Rob Clark's book is not bad for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's a pretty good start.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to remember the context and I say
it's not bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an epic book, but I say it's not bad
today because it's 2020 and that book was
[SPEAKER_03]: written 39 years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was published in, in 1981.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so the, the amount of things that
we've learned about science since then is
pretty vast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of those things are kind of left
out of the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I don't, you know, I don't talk bad
about Rob's book because it's,
[SPEAKER_03]: it fails because it's, it's not a good
book.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a great book.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's got a lot of science from,
you know, that time period and the,
[SPEAKER_03]: our perspective on breeding from that time
period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, start off with basic plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do yourself a favor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just read, you know, the first 10 chapters
of a plant breeding book, then go and
[SPEAKER_03]: start really digging into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guarantee you that it will make your
cannabis breeding that much better because
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll understand how you can do things,
what you can do and what you can't do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are important things to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you have to know, you know,
plant breeding is about getting from point
[SPEAKER_03]: A to point B.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to understand where you are at
point A and know where you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: point B.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't just get in a car and start
slamming the gas down, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and close your eyes and hope that
you're going to get to your destination.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of the way that we've been
breeding cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if that, if you can take that as an
allergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really good answer as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think probably do everyone, even myself,
good to brush up on that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question is we commonly hear
people discuss this idea about how
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders of years gone by, maybe people
working in the nineties or even earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was, it's commonly discussed that like
they just had such good stock to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then on the counter end of that
argument, you hear that, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe they were just better breeders,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But part of me thinks, well, there wasn't
as many breeders back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be weird that like,
there was such a high number of breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: that historically have been considered to
have done some pretty good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that the stock was better or
that there was some interplay of skill
[SPEAKER_00]: involved?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think either of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there, there's good plant breeders
then there's good plant breeders now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the stock that people were working
with back then was probably less refined,
[SPEAKER_03]: not better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there was probably more dogs in any,
in any family and any seed population that
[SPEAKER_03]: you'd grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably more sub par plants than
there are today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because again, the people that are
breeding today, they get to benefit from
[SPEAKER_03]: all the good choices that people made in
the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the past, I mean, it depends on how
far back you go, but I mean, we're talking
[SPEAKER_03]: like seventies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, at that point in time,
people were really using, um, what I would
[SPEAKER_03]: call like more close to land race or
indigenous or region of origin
[SPEAKER_03]: populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said before, those types of,
of genetic material, that type of genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: material is usually quite, it's a lot less
refined.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you have a lot of, of, of a lot
more, less desirable traits in those
[SPEAKER_03]: populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things like intersects, you were
talking about, you know, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: tie ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people know that tie has got
intersex plants and you know, David,
[SPEAKER_03]: I spoke a lot with David about tie because
he's probably done more tie breeding than
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: He used to go there and collect seeds and
then bring them back and do a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, he said that like the 95% of
them were just trash, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tall, weak potency, intersex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, so if you're growing like a
few thousand tie plants and you're only
[SPEAKER_03]: going to find you know, call it less than
a hundred that are even potential
[SPEAKER_03]: candidates, that's not, that's a lot of
work for, um, not a lot of reward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also tie doesn't yield anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's a tiny little sparse plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you grew 2000 plants and you're not
yielding very much, that's also not a very
[SPEAKER_03]: good use of your resources, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a reason that we don't grow
those plants anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that there's specialists that
like to go back and haul small home
[SPEAKER_03]: growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think it's great that people are
growing those things and still playing
[SPEAKER_03]: with those plants because even if you're
just crossing and stumbling around,
[SPEAKER_03]: like the chances are you might,
you might stomp, there's a possibility at
[SPEAKER_03]: least that you might stumble into
something good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I think from seriously going to
work, a line like that really,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it's nice cause Thailand is just
about to legalize medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, you'd really want to go
back to Thailand and grow 200,
[SPEAKER_03]: 300,000 plants looking for the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and, and so when I talk about
cannabis, you know, and in genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: resources, it's like, we have some painful
steps that we have to do through those
[SPEAKER_03]: processes, but that, you know,
that would be a terrible thing to have to
[SPEAKER_03]: do grow like 20 acres of plants just to
find the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, because they're not going to yield
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from a commercial perspective,
it's kind of like, how do you convince
[SPEAKER_03]: your investors that that's a good idea?
[SPEAKER_03]: But if somebody does it, and they do find
the one plant that is just Epic for
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever reason, for whatever set of
trades, then yeah, like at that point in
[SPEAKER_03]: time, we move forward from that new
starting point and then things get better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And corn, apparently I have some corn
breeder friends too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, they tell me that corn kind of
went through the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there was a lot of times where there
was a lot of crosses with all these
[SPEAKER_03]: different corn varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, the vast majority of them were
dogs.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just terrible populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were, they didn't taste good.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they didn't have good mold
resistance or, you know, crop protection
[SPEAKER_03]: traits, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once you, once you go through the hard
part of purging all those negative traits
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the population, you're actually,
you, you end up at a starting place.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's much better than where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once we get there, we'll be able to
turn cannabis into that type of crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we were talking about with corn,
where you can plant seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they all come up looking, you know,
I call them bulletproof plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come up, they're perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got the perfect chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got the great yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got all the proper resistances.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all uniform, you know,
everything that a, a true crop producer
[SPEAKER_03]: could want, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think that's really what a plant
breeder's goal should be aside from the
[SPEAKER_03]: discovery.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, you know, we sell breeders
typically in the cannabis market,
[SPEAKER_03]: sell the variation as a, a feature,
not a flaw.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not really, like if you're
growing crops and you're a, you're a
[SPEAKER_03]: farmer, you want to plant all the seeds
and they come up looking the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you plant thousand seeds and all the
plants are different, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be very happy, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because then you got to go and do all that
phenotypic selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're, you don't, you lose all the
uniformity in your crop, which is a pain
[SPEAKER_03]: in the ass for many, many reasons from
harvesting to marketing to everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so we got to get to that point in
time where we've actually bred the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: to be reliable seeds so that you can plant
a crop and the farmer can know that what
[SPEAKER_03]: is on advertising, the description is
going to come up in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really valid point there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some kind of often under-considered,
um, kind of points you raised there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a shame, but it's just part of this
evolution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, like everybody wants to be
a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a lot of people think that like,
okay, I'm, I've been growing for five
[SPEAKER_03]: years, so now I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, no, you're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a totally different set of skills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to be a grower to be able to,
to appreciate the minutia of the
[SPEAKER_03]: characteristics of the plant and look and
understand what you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, if you want to be a breeder,
go learn how to be a breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just takes time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and it's a set of heuristics that you
have to understand and methodologies that
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not difficult stuff to grasp.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like you have to be some super
special, crazy person to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't, but you do have to put in the
time, you know, just like you don't pick
[SPEAKER_03]: up a guitar and then like start touring
with Metallica.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good analogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, on the point of being a good
breeder, a question I always like to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: the guests, what are some, if any
attributes you look for in a male that you
[SPEAKER_00]: think are a sign of quality or will help
with the project?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to flip it back right to
the same thing I said before about males.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think males are a detriment to breeding
drug cannabis because they don't match the
[SPEAKER_03]: morphology and the chemistry that the
female plants use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I am really doing a lot more
work these days on, I'll do preservation
[SPEAKER_03]: run.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have a population and I do a
preservation, I'll open pollinate it using
[SPEAKER_03]: the males.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I select my females from the,
once I've open pollinated the males,
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that I've got all the genes from
the plants, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: From the entire population, you cross all
the males to all the females.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's what's called an open
pollination and all the genetic diversity
[SPEAKER_03]: is then preserved.
[SPEAKER_03]: That goes in the freezer or the fridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you take your females and you start
selecting, like I said, for traits of
[SPEAKER_03]: interest on any given size of the cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you asked me, what are
important traits?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put it back to you and say,
what are important traits for you,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, flavor, yield, potency,
or I'm not going to say potency,
[SPEAKER_03]: but cannabinoid profiles, because you
might be selecting for, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: THCV and against THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not all about the drug or at least
the THC, the recreational drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's all these other compounds that are
really have important potential medical
[SPEAKER_03]: uses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you identify that compound in
two female plants, you cross them together
[SPEAKER_03]: and now you've got a population that is
more likely to have that trait in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can start adding in,
you know, stature or morphology or plant
[SPEAKER_03]: architecture or flavor or color or,
you know, cannabinoid profile or whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Resistance to powdery mildew, resistance
to molds, resistance to pests,
[SPEAKER_03]: like all of those types of traits,
especially the last three, they're
[SPEAKER_03]: impossible to breed for.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be growing in closets.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just can't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to be growing on a field with
disease pressure and selecting plants in
[SPEAKER_03]: the environment that you're going to be
growing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that those kinds of traits,
like the things that are really important
[SPEAKER_03]: to growers, have kind of been left out of
the agendas of plant breeders,
[SPEAKER_03]: because let's face it, everybody's been
chasing flavor and potency, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Really above everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think even you look at the basic
architecture of some of these,
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant architecture, I call it,
or the stature or the structural
[SPEAKER_03]: morphology of the plant, you look at some
of these new hybrids coming out of
[SPEAKER_03]: California and their statures are
terrible, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these plants, you have to support
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to stake them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to grow them in nets because they
can't support themselves with the weight
[SPEAKER_03]: of the flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: The stems are all tiny little thin things
that you put them in a room with any kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of powdery mildew issue or greenhouse and
they're turning the powdery mildew and
[SPEAKER_03]: mold so all those traits that have been
ignored, like we really need to start
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding for those things because again,
from an industry, there's two sides and I
[SPEAKER_03]: call them, I look at them as competing
interests, but I call them growers plants
[SPEAKER_03]: and smokers plants, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants that the grower wants to grow
are typically not the plants that the
[SPEAKER_03]: smokers want to smoke, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they've kind of got competing
interests.
[SPEAKER_03]: The grower wants the big one that's
bulletproof, it's mold resistant,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's powdery mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter if mites bite it,
they just keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got these big thick leaves or
whatever the traits are that keep the
[SPEAKER_03]: mites at bay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the same with root aphids or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we could be talking about any part
of the plant here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's really what, as a breeder,
you need to deliver a plant because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're your customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your customer is not the smoker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your customer is a seed purveyor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your customer is the grower, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you need to be serving his agenda.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also his agenda is to have a
marketable product that he can sell on the
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you give him a bulletproof plant that
sucks to smoke, you're not really also not
[SPEAKER_03]: doing him any flavors, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really about balancing the wishes,
the goals and the growers versus the goals
[SPEAKER_03]: of the smokers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ideally, you can create a plant that
caters to both.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that there's any plant
breeders on the planet really with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis that are at that point yet where
we've got plants that do both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, prohibition has kicked us in the
teeth over the last 40 years, 50 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't been able to make any progress,
60 years, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't really, if you look at the
genetic progress that crops like wheat and
[SPEAKER_03]: corn have undergone in the past 60 years,
they're light years ahead of where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we just haven't had, we've been
kept out of the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wouldn't let us play in the game,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time we tried to set up a row,
the cops would show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the United States are running around
the world paying people to cut down on
[SPEAKER_03]: their weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a pretty hard time for cannabis
for the last 60 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, undeniably so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the next question, admittedly,
is one of those ones where it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a how long is a bit of string
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of growers and breeders often
ask the question, what is sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum number of seeds you'd want to run
through to feel like you had a reasonably
[SPEAKER_00]: good idea of what was in the gene pool,
so to speak?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'd love to hear your thoughts on
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it depends on the number of traits
that you're chasing.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we would do a cross down in
California, the minimum, we had these
[SPEAKER_03]: nursery trays that are called 72 cell
nursery trays.
[SPEAKER_03]: It fits in a 10 inch by 20 inch standard
nursery tray and it has 72 cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would start those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's enough to get a good,
excuse me, a good initial look at the
[SPEAKER_03]: population.
[SPEAKER_03]: And depending on what you see in that,
you might find an incredible plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might even find a plant that's a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might realize that the population
sucks or you might decide let's grow
[SPEAKER_03]: another 10 times what we grew or another
five times what we grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I kind of feel like, you know,
I'd like to do more, but just because of
[SPEAKER_03]: this is like a good size for starting,
you know, it was like it was an easy thing
[SPEAKER_03]: to put in our inner production system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not ideal, but it's it's a pretty
good idea to get a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to remember, also, most people are
breeding from like three, five or 10
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds, not 100 or 72 or, you know,
500.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 72 is a lot better than we've done in
the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't mean it's close to ideal,
but it's all about being able to move your
[SPEAKER_03]: project forward and balancing with,
you know, the resources that you have
[SPEAKER_03]: available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs money to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes time.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an opportunity cost to growing
plants because you could be growing other
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And truthfully, I got so many populations
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I'm never going to get through
them all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's about prioritizing them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes you make a cross and you're
like, well, that was that was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but now I need to grow the next
generation of those plants and the stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that's in your vault waiting to get
sprouted.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you don't even have a chance to
go back to it because every time you grow
[SPEAKER_03]: a new line, you might add a new population
or a new project to your goal or your set
[SPEAKER_03]: of breeding goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, 72 was what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good start, like I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that seems like a pretty,
pretty nice number to start with,
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's far, dude, it's far less than is
ideal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'll tell you that right off the
bat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'd want to grow a thousand if I
could.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thousand plants sent to the lab at
50 bucks a pop, that's a fifty thousand
[SPEAKER_03]: dollar bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's probably worth more than the crop
is worth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's all about balancing
your resources, your space available and
[SPEAKER_03]: your priorities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no magic numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been alluding to it all episode,
but time to get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may or may not be aware,
but you're involved in the first case of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis having a patent on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear how you got involved in
this initially.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, the first so the first they
weren't the first patents involving
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were the first utility patents
involving plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And truthfully, I had nothing to do with
the patent side of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked for a research company and I did
the plant breeding and the the IP
[SPEAKER_03]: development and the patents came from more
or less the lawyers of the group.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's certain things that I can talk
about that I just been publicly disclosed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's unfortunately stuff that I
can't because I was under contract with
[SPEAKER_03]: these folks and I signed a non-disclosure
agreement.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, they were first patents done on
work that I did on these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my name is not affiliated affiliated
with those patents at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, people get really freaked out when
you start talking about patenting plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: These weren't patents on a specific plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were patents on the use of a specific
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might seem like a like splitting hairs,
but it actually has a big difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plants plant patents per se, like specific
plant patents are only really valid in a
[SPEAKER_03]: couple of countries, one being yours and
the other one being the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Australia and the United States are,
I think, two of the only global justice
[SPEAKER_03]: systems that are legal systems that
actually recognize patents on plants in
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't recognize patents on higher
organisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although you can patent the cell of a
plant, which is kind of bizarre.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if somebody has a plant with that cell
in it, I guess you can in some way try to
[SPEAKER_03]: enforce intellectual property rights on
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's heard the story about Monsanto
going after this poor organic farmer that
[SPEAKER_03]: grew seeds and his seeds were contaminated
by Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_03]: The story that most people don't
understand, which is the truth,
[SPEAKER_03]: was that this farmer planted his soybeans
right beside Monsanto's crop that was next
[SPEAKER_03]: door and he went and actively collected
all the seeds from the plants right along
[SPEAKER_03]: the border and then grew those plants and
subjected to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those plants had a gene in them that
caused a resistance to a chemical,
[SPEAKER_03]: an agricultural chemical called glyphosate
or Roundup.
[SPEAKER_03]: Roundup is a herbicide that essentially
kills plants that don't have this specific
[SPEAKER_03]: gene in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: The gene came from a bacteria and they put
it into this plant and then once the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants had the gene, they became resistant
to this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Percy Schmeiser, who was the farmer,
somehow the media really painted him as a
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of a hero, this poor organic farmer
against big old bad Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong, I have no love for
Monsanto, but the truth of the matter was
[SPEAKER_03]: that this guy actively went after using
their genetic technology and he wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: growing organically.
[SPEAKER_03]: He exposed all those seeds to this
agrochemical and then in the process he
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially stole their IP.
[SPEAKER_03]: He took the gene and he went to court and
he lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: But somehow in the media that became,
oh this poor organic farmer, he was being
[SPEAKER_03]: bullied by the big guy and I think that's
probably a bit of a narrative that was
[SPEAKER_03]: created because there's a certain segment
of the population that's against genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: modifications.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that we do genetic modifications
now compared to the way that we did them
[SPEAKER_03]: 20, 30 years ago is really different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back then it was probably closer to doing
surgery with a Japanese sword rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: a scalpel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowadays we're very, very skilled.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have all these new technologies that
allow us to go in and create specific
[SPEAKER_03]: changes to DNA like you were talking
about, heavenly, with CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those things are just by the wayside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, just to clear it up, I think there
was a lot of people running around online
[SPEAKER_03]: saying that I was patenting all the world
and I was trying to steal the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: world's strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truth is, I had nothing to do with it
other than breeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name's not on the patents.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get any intellectual property
rights from them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get any royalties from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really have absolutely nothing to do
with it and I don't work with that group
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore and I haven't for a number of
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's just kind of a funny thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started working with the group because
they were quite patient focused and I had
[SPEAKER_03]: an opportunity to have someone build us
our dream lab to really start screening
[SPEAKER_03]: large populations of cannabis in a way
with what we call brute force chemical
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like I said, it's expensive to grow a
lot of plants and then send every single
[SPEAKER_03]: one of them to the laboratory and have
full terpene and cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also looked at other chemicals as well
that influence smell and flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a learning experience for me and I
really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were some good folks in the group
and we created some really cool plants
[SPEAKER_03]: that had unique chemistry, CBDV,
THCV, CBD type 2 plants with altered
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid ratios and really interesting
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that stuff was able to go to a
series of dispensaries and companies that
[SPEAKER_03]: were growing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really a lot of fun and it was
really gratifying to be able to create
[SPEAKER_03]: these plants that we'd always talked about
and deliver them to patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a few people in the community
that were pretty upset about the idea of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis patents being granted and they
did a lot of effort to create a narrative
[SPEAKER_03]: where people thought that we were trying
to steal the world and nothing could be
[SPEAKER_03]: more further from the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only things that were patented were
new unique combinations of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: and terpenes that didn't exist before.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were new plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really were new inventions.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we did that, I guess the lawyers for
the group were like, oh, we need to
[SPEAKER_03]: protect these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's also a thing that
people kind of want to say, it's unfair
[SPEAKER_03]: that you can patent a plant or a life or
an organism that occurred in nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, dude, these things didn't occur in
nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: These plants, you're not going to go into
any population and find a plant with this
[SPEAKER_03]: set of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just don't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're new.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't spend many hundreds of thousands
of dollars or more doing research into any
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of technology or plant or breeding
program or you're designing a new computer
[SPEAKER_03]: or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't spend money in research and
development if the people that are paying
[SPEAKER_03]: for the research and development can't get
a return on their investment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the way it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patents aren't the only way, like we said,
that you can get intellectual property
[SPEAKER_03]: rights on plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's these things called PBRs or plant
breeder rights registrations through UPOV,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the Union for the Protection of
Plant Varieties, which is a global
[SPEAKER_03]: organization that, like I said before,
kind of oversees the intellectual property
[SPEAKER_03]: matters of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you spent 15 years to make a new apple
variety and let's just call it,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, Granny Smith or whatever,
you should have the rights to reap the
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial rewards for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of that system exists that,
yeah, you get the commercial rights,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you have to make the plant variety
available to any other breeder in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can take that variety and use your
work to make something better.
[SPEAKER_03]: That better plant, even though you have
your commercial rights for 20 years or 15
[SPEAKER_03]: years or whatever it is, depending on the
jurisdiction, it might be in five years
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody's created a better variety of
yours anyway than yours anyway using your
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason it's set up like that is so
that humanity benefits from ... It's a
[SPEAKER_03]: communal development where the whole world
gets to benefit from a new technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you might come up with a new
technology and you get some rights to a
[SPEAKER_03]: few years to use it, but everybody else in
the industry also gets to take it and then
[SPEAKER_03]: start using it in their own breeding
programs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a trade-off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, it's a funny thing because I've
had death threats online about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just bizarre because it's like,
read the patent.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name's not even on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really have nothing to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get a penny from it and you're
threatening my life because of some
[SPEAKER_03]: perceived notion that somebody took
something from you which couldn't even be
[SPEAKER_03]: further from the truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, it's just weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just what it is, but hey man,
that's part of the thing that's going on
[SPEAKER_03]: from this transition from the old world to
the new world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been doing this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been growing cannabis for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've worked with people all over the world
and all these different really ... Like I
[SPEAKER_03]: said, all the people that we've talked
about, these people are all colleagues and
[SPEAKER_03]: friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get new people in the industry
that come in and they've been around for
[SPEAKER_03]: two years and they're accusing you of
stealing from the community, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like, go fuck yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you're Johnny Come Lately.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've dedicated my life to this kind of
work and you're telling me that I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: stealing from you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a break.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: Truthfully, the reason that we did the
work is so that we could provide these new
[SPEAKER_03]: types of medicine to patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't feel bad about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I would seek patents
myself on plants, but again, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: apply in my market because in Canada,
that's not how you seek intellectual
[SPEAKER_03]: property protection.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is one way you can do it in the States
and you can do it in Australia,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's not something that interests me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a comprehensive answer to a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people have been
interested in hearing the backstory
[SPEAKER_00]: behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another similar question you hear
discussed in that same vein, which I've
[SPEAKER_00]: always been interested in but quite
skeptical of the truth behind it is you
[SPEAKER_00]: hear people discuss this idea that if
someone were to be able to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: obtain a patent right or some sort of
patent over a very primordial sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis genetics, which I don't even know
if that's possible, that they could then
[SPEAKER_00]: pull the plug on anyone growing a distant
descendant of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To give it some context, if somehow I got
a patent for the original Northern Lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fear is that I could claim
infringement on anyone who's growing
[SPEAKER_00]: anything with Northern Lights in the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody that says that doesn't understand
how patents work and intellectual property
[SPEAKER_03]: rights work.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get a plant patent in the States
or Australia, you get the rights to that
[SPEAKER_03]: one clone, that one specific genotype and
it has to be very described.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually they've done a DNA fingerprint
profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody else takes that plant and
cross it to something else, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's out in the open.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still can't grow their one plant
that's registered, but you can make a
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid of it and grow that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like this idea that
somebody's patenting primordially.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing about patenting primordial
varieties, if you want to call them that,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's actually a great little term,
is that you can't patent anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the key criteria for getting a
patent granted is that your patent,
[SPEAKER_03]: your invention, this is what a patent is,
is a protection on an invention.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your invention has to be novel and that
just means new.
[SPEAKER_03]: You actually have to have something that's
new.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't come along and take something
from the market and patent it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: They'd never grant the patent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if they did grant the patent,
patent is just really a piece of paper
[SPEAKER_03]: that says, I own this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got this patent and I own this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone can say, I'm going to challenge
your patent so they can take you to court.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then there's a court case and the whole
process that goes on about deciding who
[SPEAKER_03]: actually owns the patent.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're granted a patent on a plant and
somebody else says, hey, I've got the same
[SPEAKER_03]: plant or whatever, you have to sue the
person that's violating your rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a defensive strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you own the patent, you're not the one
getting sued.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the one that's doing the suing.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you start suing somebody,
it could be ruled that your patent's
[SPEAKER_03]: invalid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be worth your while to go after
someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really has to be affecting your bottom
line.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you always open up yourself to the
chance that the court rules in the other
[SPEAKER_03]: person's favor and you lose your patent
rights.
[SPEAKER_03]: A patent is not like an impenetrable
bulletproof vest.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a stake in the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: When people stake mining sites,
it's like you're planting a flag on the
[SPEAKER_03]: ground and saying, this space is mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether that space is yours, it really can
be a matter for the courts.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't necessarily mean that your
claim is true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just means that you got it by the guy
that says, yeah, that seems like a legit
[SPEAKER_03]: claim.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take that for what it's worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a sneaking suspicion that that might
be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to hear your input on that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've got some more or less
technical questions as we're on the tail
[SPEAKER_00]: end of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested to hear the answers to some
of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that's came up a few times from our
guests when I put the call out,
[SPEAKER_00]: if anyone had any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get the name Chimera?
[SPEAKER_03]: I just chose it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was studying DNA at the time and
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a funny question because
years after I chose the name, I actually
[SPEAKER_03]: became a chimera through surgery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chimera means different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Greek mythology, it was a mythical
beast that was a lion.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tail of the lion was a serpent and
there was a goat head or two goat heads
[SPEAKER_03]: growing out of the back of the animal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, it was this scary mythical beast
that was composed of three different
[SPEAKER_03]: monsters, really is what it was supposed
to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the DNA world, a chimera is something
that has DNA from two different organisms.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, if someone had a heart
transplant and they got a heart from
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody else, they'd become a chimera
because now they had an organ of a
[SPEAKER_03]: different type of DNA growing within their
body, which satisfy the condition of what
[SPEAKER_03]: a chimera is.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, what it meant was a combination,
a fusion of science and cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: which back then at the time was completely
unheard of.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know anybody in my cannabis
community that was into science.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just didn't care.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so interested in learning about the
plant and chemical analysis and the
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it was more of a symbol for the
fusion of understanding of science and
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't ever intend for it to be a name
that stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a name that I chose to
register on an internet web board at one
[SPEAKER_03]: point in time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stuck and I never changed my name on
the internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always was the type of person that I
would just say what I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you didn't like what I was saying,
well, too bad, but I'm not going to say
[SPEAKER_03]: something and then change my identity so
that I don't have to have the consequences
[SPEAKER_03]: of what I said.
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, my word means something.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always just kept the same name over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long time now or 25 years,
at least on the internet, which is bizarre
[SPEAKER_03]: to even consider that that's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it meant to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Later on, I developed a condition called
keratoconus and I had to have two cornea
[SPEAKER_03]: transplants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got corneas from two different
people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually see the world through the eyes
of two people that have left this world
[SPEAKER_03]: becoming our chimera, funnily enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a real life sort of twist to the
name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was bizarre.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even realize it until it happened
and then I was like, hey, I guess I'm a
[SPEAKER_00]: chimera now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question we had was,
how do you store your seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your what's your method for long
term germination viability?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly just the fridge four degrees
Celsius in a very expensive scientific
[SPEAKER_03]: incubator that I bought at an auction for
a song.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that suits me very, very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, taking cues from I actually came up
with my own.
[SPEAKER_03]: I decided to put them at four degrees
Celsius because there was all this
[SPEAKER_03]: discussion on whether freezing cycles
damage the seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, I figured getting the
closest possible to freezing without
[SPEAKER_03]: actually freezing was probably best for
these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water's densest point is at four degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to me, that seemed like the optimum
point to be storing seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And later when I, you know, started
spending a lot more time with David and we
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of you know, we once we became good
friends, we kind of just opened the doors
[SPEAKER_03]: to each other's knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's like I taught him everything I
know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he taught me everything he knew.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just kind of had this open exchange of
ideas and and sharing techniques and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's been actually storing seeds under
the exact same conditions for over 25
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we were cataloging this massive
collection a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_03]: we we actually pulled some out and did
some germination tests on these,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, 25 year old seeds and we were
pulling out 25 year old seeds that were
[SPEAKER_03]: germinating at like 80, 90 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's perfectly sufficient for,
I think, the time scale of the rest of my
[SPEAKER_03]: life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think seed fridges are fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can now do I've got a friend in that
was working in Spain named the Sicilian
[SPEAKER_03]: guy named Salvatore Casano.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he started doing some cryopreservation
on seeds and that worked out pretty well,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a deep freeze and liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You you you actually don't put the seeds
in the liquid nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: You store them in the gas above the
liquid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not quite as cold.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought that was really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I started looking into whether we
could freeze tissue cultures.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can like there's all these
different protocols online for hops and
[SPEAKER_03]: other plants on how to actually freeze
shoot tips.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a real trick to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few tricks to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was quite difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's actually possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's an expense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It costs money to do it and maintain the
tissue cultures at that temperature for
[SPEAKER_03]: extended periods of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's totally possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, you can freeze it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use cryopreservation to freeze
material.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can use cryopreservation to freeze
seeds and you can keep seeds in the fridge
[SPEAKER_03]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as long as they're properly dried,
you can do things like flushing them with
[SPEAKER_03]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or actually, I'm sorry, you eliminate the
oxygen from the environment where the
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds are stored, like, you know,
specific little vials or something or
[SPEAKER_03]: nitrogen container nitrogen containers
where you've pushed out the the oxygen
[SPEAKER_03]: gas, you essentially flood it with with
nitrogen and then you seal it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those can extend the seed life even
further.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think, you know, this a lot of
people get all bent out of shape.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, you're selling these seeds
and they're 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just put them in the dirt and see.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, don't worry about how old they
are.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they germinate, then they're
germinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they don't, I'll send you more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of the way I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I'm not, you know, I don't obviously
I don't retail seeds myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: We sell them through legal channels and in
Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I always tell my retailers.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have problems and people call and
complaining, just give them more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll replace them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's not I kind of I said at one
point in time online, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not just giving you seeds with a
germination guarantee.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, if you don't like the plants,
tell me, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come back to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me what's wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll send you more.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to send you seeds until you're
happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it's that's that's why we do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want people to grow the things that we
find interesting and enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they if they for some reason grow
them and they feel like that we've let
[SPEAKER_03]: them down and they they have they've had a
subpar experience, dude, I'll make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that the retailer send them the seeds
until they're they're happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what I want from our
customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why that's why I do the work.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I love working with cannabis is
because it makes me happy and I want other
[SPEAKER_03]: people to experience that same joy through
our seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, really, really beautiful sentiment
around the plant, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question I had was what style
of growing do you like to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you could phrase it as what style
of growing do you like to advocate for
[SPEAKER_00]: like cocoa, soilless soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you stand?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, to me, it's six to one
half a dozen the other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all growers are going to find
they're all they're all going to find
[SPEAKER_03]: their own unique thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if I had my druthers live organic
soil, respectful of the plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: respectful of the environment,
respectful of your resources around you,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I don't like the idea of people
growing with tons of salts and that
[SPEAKER_03]: running off into groundwater or,
you know, people flushing nutrients down
[SPEAKER_03]: the toilet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's all bullshit to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it's really not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, to be doing that to the planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need to be damaged in the planet
just because we're growing some cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be able to be grown in line with
nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, if you have to grow in a
there's reasons why you would want to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: in a sterile hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you're in a certain
commercial greenhouse or whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's lots of there's lots of ways to
grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not really against or for any of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if people can be sustainable about
it and healthy about it and you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: spraying like agrochemicals on the plants
like pesticides and fungicides and all
[SPEAKER_03]: that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that's really to me that
those are the important things.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a bunch of work on different
cultivation varieties with our good
[SPEAKER_03]: because again, we had this lab in the
standardized cultivation environment,
[SPEAKER_03]: both greenhouse and indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could run the same cultivars over and
over and over again in different inter
[SPEAKER_03]: like so we'd have a you know, it was it
was ours had a couple hundred lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and we had like 20 light rooms,
for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every week you'd be harvesting a
different room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So rather than putting making one room,
would you cushion one room train wreck and
[SPEAKER_03]: one room blue dream, we would run a single
four by eight table of each cultivar in
[SPEAKER_03]: every room and harvested every week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then those samples would all go to the
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would do random sampling from the crops
or represent representative sampling from
[SPEAKER_03]: the crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And each crop would get a lab test.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what it allowed us to do is go back
and look at the environmental data and
[SPEAKER_03]: see, oh, look, there was a you know,
there was a humidity spike or a
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature spike at this week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look how it changed the terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would vary the diets on the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would feed them, you know, chemical
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would feed them organic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd feed them chemical fertilizers with a
bio stimulant or organic fertilizers with
[SPEAKER_03]: a bio stimulant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'd see like, oh, look, when you use
when you use organic, when you use
[SPEAKER_03]: organics to organic methods with bio
stimulants, the the terpenes would go up
[SPEAKER_03]: and the cannabinoids would drop down a
little bit when you were growing them more
[SPEAKER_03]: or less hydroponically with chemical
salts, very little organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabinoids would spike and the TH or
the the terpene contents would crash a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's all there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just tool to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just they're just tools in the
toolbox.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really about what you're trying to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're making really beautiful extracts
and flavor is important, I'd be growing
[SPEAKER_03]: organically with bio stimulants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking to make THC diamonds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: These you've probably seen those and that
kind of product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then use chemical salts as long as you can
do it in a way that's not damaging the
[SPEAKER_03]: planet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was more of a personal question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, do you feel like there's
a compromise between big yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: fast flower times and inherent quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess what I'm wondering is in a world
filled with these ultra small yielding
[SPEAKER_00]: exotic plants, so to speak, and exotic is
like, you know, a poor code word for like
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there does still exist a plant
that's like big yielding, fast flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: high quality, or at some point you have to
kind of compromise on some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to compromise today because those
combinations of traits don't exist
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I firmly believe that through proper
breeding strategies, and especially with
[SPEAKER_03]: the aid of genomics and the laboratory
chemical analysis, that we can get the
[SPEAKER_03]: best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the joy and the goal of the
breeding is that it's all about what we
[SPEAKER_03]: can produce for the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really those things are just
combinations of traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no reasons that we can't just
shuffle the deck and put all those
[SPEAKER_03]: combinations of traits together in a
specific way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right now the OGs and the things
like that, the cookies, they're small.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can you can embiggen them maybe is
the good word through selection and
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can improve their yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can improve their stature.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can improve the resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that stuff is it's going to
take time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these aren't this is not make a
couple of crosses and boom, next year we
[SPEAKER_03]: got a huge cookies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This these will be like five, 10 year
projects where you learn to understand,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, these are the genes that are important
for bigness and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you reshuffle those genes,
reshuffle the deck and screen and look for
[SPEAKER_03]: plants that are that have the genes for
bigness and the genes for whatever quality
[SPEAKER_03]: metrics we we we ascribe to the plants
together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the combination of those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, because of linkage,
that might be a little bit difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with the right with, you know,
with being able to screen, it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: about plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about having the be able to screen
the plant numbers, having access to the
[SPEAKER_03]: lab data and being able to afford to do
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really those are the barriers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not impossible, but it's also not
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just going to say a bit of a
random one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got submitted by the guests,
but they they noticed that somehow you
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up on one of the George Savante DVDs
about how to grow marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were wondering, what was the
backstory behind that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it just like coincidental time when
you were there or had that go down?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, George found me online.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess he was writing a new book and he
was trying to get contributions from all
[SPEAKER_03]: these people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said everybody that he asked about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, come and talk to Kamara.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so he found me and he just,
you know, he sent me an email one day and
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, no shit, it's horror.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I just knew him as the guy
through the books.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The books and the DVD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when he caught me, contacted me,
I was like, right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll I'll chat with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, I want to do this breeding
chapter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking, you know, you're the guy
to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I agreed to to do the breeding
chapter for the book.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he came to Vancouver about six,
six months later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Funnily enough, it was the week before
Mark Emory was busted by the DEA on the
[SPEAKER_03]: charges that got him extradited to the
United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that week before we built a grow
room in the bank across the street from
[SPEAKER_03]: Mark Emory's shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just for the purpose of the video,
I mean, we didn't grow in it, but we built
[SPEAKER_03]: it for the purposes of showing people how
to build a grow room for the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of took him around the city and
introduced him to a bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said to me one day, he's like,
you got to be in this video.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, George, I don't want to be
in your video.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not interested in putting my face on
the video.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, we'll get you a mask.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was how I ended up on that video in a
weird lion's mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good backstory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you can fill us in likewise on
this next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you able to tell us a little bit about
the Paki Maroc cut you selected from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Maroc line?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, she's a big she's just I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how Moroccan she was.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you were saying before,
things kind of get modernized because
[SPEAKER_03]: people bring in new genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what Moroccan originally was,
I think it came from Turkish hemp because
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just it's so similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cannabini contents were really low
for traditional Moroccan hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, obviously, over the last 30 years,
they've been bringing Dutch seeds down
[SPEAKER_03]: there all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not very far.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you know, I mean, Moroccan hash is
one of the major one of the major export
[SPEAKER_03]: centers for Moroccan hashes Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's definitely a lot of back and
forth that people are doing between
[SPEAKER_03]: business between those two places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think as the guys would come up to
to sell their hash, they'd buy some seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: and bring those back down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those things would get crossed into
the natural populations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over time, they become more
modernized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this one plant that we got there that I
pulled out of the population, it was fat.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was like six and a half weeks,
seven weeks, and it was like pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: done.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it had this really strange.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was this unheard of trait?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it used so it put on so much weight in
like week three and week four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it was bulking up before other plants
were even putting little cotton balls on
[SPEAKER_03]: the tips of their shoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it used it used so much nitrogen that
if you if you if you stopped feeding it
[SPEAKER_03]: vegetative food, and then switched to
flowering food right at twelve,
[SPEAKER_03]: twelve or when you induced it into flower,
by the time you were like the end of week
[SPEAKER_03]: three or beginning week four, the plant
was really yellowing out significantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was doing that because it was using
so much nitrogen to build that really
[SPEAKER_03]: early, early floral mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a pretty neat trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could, you know, as soon as I
learned that about the timing of the
[SPEAKER_03]: trade, it caught me off guard for a couple
of grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then finally, I was like, I'm going to
hit this thing with with way more nitrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: than the rest of the plants early in
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it managed to stay green all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing just bulked like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we were talking about growers plants
before this one was a growers plant,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it had a really nice kind of raspberry
nose to it fruity, but like really in that
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of raspberry flavor class.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she just became something I was like,
this thing is actually worth keeping and
[SPEAKER_03]: worth breeding with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: We made a bunch of crosses with it and
she's still around, but it's yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's that's what we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great little explanation on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: On to the next strain of yours I'm
interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had a few people inquire about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You even mentioned it yourself,
the mental floss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you ever remake it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you think it was about that
lime which made it so memorable in so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people's minds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably the name.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great commercial plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a great commercial plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could I could pull two pounds off of a
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it and the thing that I really loved
about it is it made these this really,
[SPEAKER_03]: really high quality bubble hash like water
hash and even dry sift was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was incredible, but it really held on
to its flavor through the water process
[SPEAKER_03]: and it made a hash that was just
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember bringing it to Amsterdam the
first time I met David and David is an
[SPEAKER_03]: insane hash head and are, you know,
our mutual friend bubble man.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was there and he said, David,
you really got to try this hashish and
[SPEAKER_03]: pulled it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's something I call the tell or
the bubble tell when when the hash is of
[SPEAKER_03]: such a high quality and you put it in the
pipe for someone and they can see the bowl
[SPEAKER_03]: when they're when they're burning it,
their eyes open up and their eyebrows
[SPEAKER_03]: essentially hit the roof.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're so surprised at the the
way that it melts and the flavor that
[SPEAKER_03]: comes off of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I put it in David's bowl
and he was he definitely gave the bubble
[SPEAKER_03]: towel.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, you know, it was it was hard
for him to not, you know, to to be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't, you know, it was hard for him to
not give me respect at that point in time,
[SPEAKER_03]: because not only did he think I knew what
I was talking about, I might have been a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot younger, but, you know, I had the good
quality hash and that's kind of like the
[SPEAKER_03]: the secret handshake to get into the club.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you show up with the great hash that
you've made yourself, it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: you're welcome to sit at the table.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one of the reasons why she's
also got a beautiful color.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can probably see that picture
on my Twitter and you might have seen them
[SPEAKER_03]: online.
[SPEAKER_03]: She does this great, lovely rainbow thing
when it goes at the end of flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: The leaves go from purple to yellow or
shades of purple and yellow on the same
[SPEAKER_03]: leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just a beautiful plant with a
beautiful smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great yield, super dense nugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, so I've got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll come back in it in some form.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got tons of different hybrids of it,
but I'm really working on the right
[SPEAKER_03]: combination of plants for the next release
of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still tons of the original.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've got to have there's there's,
you know, at least 10, 20,000 seeds left
[SPEAKER_03]: over the first one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anybody wants it, you can still hop
on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exciting to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one I wanted to ask about was in
your Sassafras cross, you use what you
[SPEAKER_00]: refer to as the superior Afghan skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be able to tell us a little bit
more about that and what made it so
[SPEAKER_00]: memorable and just superior to the others
in your mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it was superior to the others.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think honestly, going back, I probably
wouldn't use that plant again.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was superior than the other Afghan
skunks that I had seen because it had a
[SPEAKER_03]: great growing characteristic and stature.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a nice flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was old school weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't new school weed, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't it didn't have that banging
scent profile that a lot of the newer
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff has.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was great that you could grow it
surreptitiously, you know, like I could
[SPEAKER_03]: hand it to commercial growers and they
could put up big grows of it and not worry
[SPEAKER_03]: about sense and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've really moved away from those
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried to move away from those plants
because I think that we've.
[SPEAKER_03]: Graduated out of that phase of having to
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Low set low set plants, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I went into this hydra store once and when
I first moved to Vancouver, I went into
[SPEAKER_03]: this hydra store and you know some of my
girlfriends brought me in to meet this
[SPEAKER_03]: plant pathologist girl that was working
there and they introduced me and she said,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, you grew you invented the for you bred
the frostbite, didn't you?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, yeah, I did actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she was like, that plant almost got me
fucking busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, she was so livid about how much
that plant stank, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, you know, I was like,
yeah, that's kind of what we select for
[SPEAKER_03]: now, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's that's what we want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some carbon filters, so.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, great.
Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please go on.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, just she relayed the story about her
landlord's planet outside and she was
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, you know, grower problems,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, carbon filters are pretty good
these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next one, the C4 strain,
this had always caught my eye because
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously the name it's very close to the
C5, which is a notable clone and Northern
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights Hayes.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the genetics couldn't be more
different on paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cotton Candy crossed by Shishkeberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was this an intentional play on words
because you saw some similarities or
[SPEAKER_00]: purely coincidental?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, the C4 for me meant fast and
explosive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a kind of Porsche, a Porsche
Carrera 4.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was really what it was named
after.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the idea that it was so fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it hit this thing also hit like
week six and seven and just exploded.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really thought that it was I still
do feel like it was a big improvement on
[SPEAKER_03]: either of the two parent plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when they came together, you know,
one plus one definitely equaled three.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had the best of both really rock hard
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember I had this one one grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he went by the name Reggie the
Roddy and he used to grow the stuff and
[SPEAKER_03]: just turn the entire crop into hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had this the hash was white,
like it was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was the most light colored hash I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'd put a flame to it and it would
just turn to a liquid right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, yeah, I'll probably do something
with that when I want to get some space to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually grow into.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've actually got an opportunity now with
two different 20 plus acre legal farms
[SPEAKER_03]: that are within an hour of where I live
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've both offered me as much space
as I want to kind of play over there and
[SPEAKER_03]: just screen for things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to start, you know,
try to improve the auto lines that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: working with and really try to make true
to type auto plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of times you'll buy like
these days, you'll buy auto plant that's
[SPEAKER_03]: like auto cookies or auto, whatever the
name is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't actually smell anything
like the named plant, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because autos are a little bit of a tricky
thing to work with breeding wise that you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to breed them in a slightly different
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't keep backup clones or most
people can't keep backup clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So because they're just difficult to keep
alive in that in the colonial state unless
[SPEAKER_03]: you're using a specific tissue culture
regimen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to try to use genomics and.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, classical breeding techniques to
actually make auto versions of all the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants that you, you know, that you'd want
to have on the market, because that kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of thing in Canada would be really ideal
for the new.
[SPEAKER_03]: The new industry where people are growing
purely for, you know, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: rosin extracts, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to have like a few acres or more,
ideally of plants that are going to that
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to flower fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a relatively short season here in
Canada compared to say California.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you got to pretty much be done
and out of the ground by mid to late
[SPEAKER_03]: September in most parts of the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even going that long, you might be
well into the wet season.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're risking, you know, molds and all
the bad things that come with rain and
[SPEAKER_03]: flowering cannabis together.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea is to like really try to breed
those things and screen a lot of the old
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you just can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't grow them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all indoors are in the
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just don't have that much room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a couple of 20 acre plots is pretty
attractive to to look at for screening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is, will everything finish in
time?
[SPEAKER_03]: But you just you don't know until you do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe a bit of a hard one to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But out of all the various lines you've
worked thus far, which are you most proud
[SPEAKER_00]: of or most pleased with the results?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like asking a father what
child is their favorite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, the most proud one of the last
couple of years has been this
[SPEAKER_03]: beta-cariophylline CBD plant that I bred
for the group down in California that was
[SPEAKER_03]: subsequently patented.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBDV is a chemical everybody knows about
THCV, THCV, but CBDV is a chemical that's
[SPEAKER_03]: even more effective for epilepsy than CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we created a variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I found the propyl plants and started
breeding them into the CBD background,
[SPEAKER_03]: we ended up finding plants that were like
roughly 50, 50 percent of the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: fraction was CBD and the other 50 percent
was CBDV with like very little THC in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it had zero recreational or fun
potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not that kind of program.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the idea came to me at one point in
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I was at the ISRS listening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some speakers talked there about
beta-cariophylline and they mentioned that
[SPEAKER_03]: beta-cariophylline was a it had
anti-spasmodic properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, damn, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to breed a beta-cariophylline
terpene profile into the CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I started looking at what other
turpinoids could also have anti-spasmodic
[SPEAKER_03]: effect and linalool, which is from
lavender, also has some anti convulsive
[SPEAKER_03]: properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was like, you know what,
I'm just going to try and find a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that I can stack with CBD, CBDV.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I can make it have a terpene
profile that's like beta-cariophylline and
[SPEAKER_03]: linalool rich, then that's probably going
to be a good plant for kids with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of the genesis is like,
how do you take a medicine like CBD that
[SPEAKER_03]: all these children are using for,
you know, what is it Lennox-Gastaut
[SPEAKER_03]: syndrome or whatever it's called?
[SPEAKER_03]: These epileptic disorders for children.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're really massive.
[SPEAKER_03]: These kids have epilepsy so bad that it
leads to these massive developmental
[SPEAKER_03]: problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you know the story of
Charlotte Figi, but I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: she passed this year and she was just a
kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like she was a baby, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just horrible watching these kids
go through this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can make a medicine that
actually works for them, that's pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm not in the medical testing
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's really, I don't consider that
my job.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of see my job as let's make the
plants and then let the doctors figure out
[SPEAKER_03]: what's going to work for the kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when, when we crossed the CBDV plant
that I had made into the plants with the
[SPEAKER_03]: desired terpene profile, we had to flip
through a couple of generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: But after a couple of generations,
this one plant popped out and boom,
[SPEAKER_03]: it had the right cannabinoids and it had
the right terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really like the, in my opinion,
and maybe I'm biased in saying this,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I think that in my opinion,
it was really one of the first plants that
[SPEAKER_03]: was made so that you had the cannabinoids
that were effective for or potentially
[SPEAKER_03]: effective for this one condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you surrounded it with an
entourage effect of molecules that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that had the, you know, that also had been
shown in the scientific literature to do
[SPEAKER_03]: that same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, it just, to me, it was like,
you kind of epitomize that new kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: potential of what we could do with
cannabis, where you're creating a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: with the idea that it's actually optimized
for a specific condition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: A specific ailment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so when it popped out and it
worked, it was, you know, it started off
[SPEAKER_03]: as a breeding goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, can we do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a breeding experiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we found the plant, it was like,
man, it was just a really good feeling,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so yeah, I hope, I hope that plant
ended up making it into the hands of
[SPEAKER_03]: people or the children that could use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a, what a powerful and fulfilling
feeling that must've been at the end of it
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, you know, I've, we've always
been breeding for how plants make you feel
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a totally different,
it's a different type of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, okay, I'm going to make some
cannabis that's not for the stoners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be able to create a plant with
potential therapeutic benefit that's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to help children that are really suffering
is like, Jesus, dude, it's so rewarding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I can't even tell you how good it
made me feel when it, when it popped up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, let's, let's,
let's figure out how to make more plants
[SPEAKER_03]: like this that have no fun potential.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, cause it's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like making the fun plants too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, it's just another, it's just
another thing to help a different group of
[SPEAKER_03]: people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting towards the tail end of things,
just so you know, don't want to keep you
[SPEAKER_00]: too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, are there any BC varieties that you
feel don't really get the mention they
[SPEAKER_00]: deserve ones that kind of fly under the
radar?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the add onto that would be,
are there any maybe older school breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: who similarly don't really get the
recognition you think they deserve?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's probably tons of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think most people, I try to be
pretty good about probably the guys that I
[SPEAKER_03]: like.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I really like Jaime from Resin
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few other people over working
with autos in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a good friend named Roberto,
um, who has a seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's actually folded the company.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were doing Grosso Matic and they
were, they were kind of neat little
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I think anybody that's working,
you know, Jaime from Resin Seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: his work with Kanatonic, my friend
Salvatore Casano that is not a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a, he works more with like hemp and
CBG varieties and he's an incredible
[SPEAKER_03]: agronomist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, there's a, there's a lot of
people out there that are doing things
[SPEAKER_03]: just quietly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I just met another guy
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he lives just on an island,
just off the coast here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I, he's doing a whole bunch of
interesting work and I'd never even met
[SPEAKER_03]: him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know he existed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, just, I'd like to reach out
to all those people and meet them and
[SPEAKER_03]: then, you know, see how we can support
them and how we can help make their work
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, in terms of the Vancouver Island
stuff, our industry kind of out here got,
[SPEAKER_03]: really went through, uh, uh, not a great
phase with all the purple cushions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, everybody liked it, you know,
the market certainly loves it,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the genetic diversity amongst the
growers, it's like everybody started
[SPEAKER_03]: growing the purple and the pink Kush and
Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, these, we have these plants
here, people call like death Bubba and all
[SPEAKER_03]: these different variations on the
cushions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really all the same flavor class.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, they're, they're different
variations of high limonene, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: high myrcine and high beta cariophylline
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so kind of in that OG master Kush
family of plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, yeah, we've got, the market here
has really gone through a period where
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like, no, it's like, if you want to
grow and sell weed, everybody was growing
[SPEAKER_03]: and selling Kush and it wiped out a lot of
the genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was all happening right around
the time that I kind of left for
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I went to California,
we did this, like I said, this massively
[SPEAKER_03]: deep dive and analyzing all these
different types of cannabis from all over
[SPEAKER_03]: the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the process, learned a lot about
the different types of chemistries,
[SPEAKER_03]: terpene, propyl walls that can exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's kind of really one of my
things right now is that I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: bring all those things back and re
diversify the market here, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that it's more than just that one
flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I, like we were talking
about before, we're trying to bring back
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these milder varieties of
cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which again, sounds counterintuitive to
people, but it's all about providing the
[SPEAKER_03]: breadth and diversity of the cannabis
species so that anybody that wants to use
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis can have something that they
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't have to like, you know,
like if I want to give something to my
[SPEAKER_03]: mom, like if I gave her a toke of an OG,
dude, she'd be on the couch for a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so having these lighter,
lighter, kind of more social varieties,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, for certain population groups,
like, you know, a gift to grandmas and
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that don't want to, that don't want
to get blasted and they just want to have
[SPEAKER_03]: their pain taken away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that those things are really
important to add on the market too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, uh, we're facing a little bit of
a challenge with growers and with
[SPEAKER_03]: distributors who don't, you know,
they think that they know better and maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: they do, but I don't think that the
distribution people know better.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they just know that the only
thing that sells is high THC stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they only want high THC stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's kind of like having a liquor
store that only sells whiskey,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't get a beer or a bottle of wine
and it's not really a diverse market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's sad, but true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what are your thoughts and experiences
on Hawaiian strains and the Mexican
[SPEAKER_00]: strains in general?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got a good sort of,
um, experience base with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the thing which interests me is that
you commonly hear about Thai and Southeast
[SPEAKER_00]: Asian lines being all the rage these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one ever really mentions Mexican.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they'll ever make a comeback?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when, I mean, Mexico is developing
an industry, they're about to,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, like they've got some version of
legalization essentially with they're
[SPEAKER_03]: allowing home grower or not home growers,
but people to grow a little bit of their
[SPEAKER_03]: own.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that they're trying to work
out how the system, what it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I'd like to take a lot of those
things back there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And replant them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, again, the way cannabis was grown
there, it was all gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was, nobody was growing from clone
back then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was grown from seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was probably a lot of dogs,
but I think that if you took them back
[SPEAKER_03]: down there and grew them in the right
environment or even in very Southern
[SPEAKER_03]: California, um, that you'd be able to find
a lot of traits of really, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: related to resistance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd really like to see these
equatorial morals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it would be hard to sell them in
the Canadian marketplace because just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the market wants big fat buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a weird thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's just what it is, what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, you know, I'd like to put on like
the, the, the, the Guerrero and that
[SPEAKER_03]: Highland Mexican crossed with the
blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's just, it just makes these weird
knuckly long Fox taily spirals,
[SPEAKER_03]: just collections of Brax, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, that's, I think that would be a
sign of a healthy market.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they, there is that diversity in
choice for consumers, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: A legal market of just Kush isn't very
exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think everyone's a bit burnt out on
that right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got its time and its place,
but it's like not the one that's smoke at
[SPEAKER_03]: first thing in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are your thoughts on males found
in S1s?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think the most notable case of this
is kind of biogen release, like the peyote
[SPEAKER_00]: purple line, which supposedly was the
result of like a male they found in some
[SPEAKER_00]: Baba Kush S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think this is a, like a case of
pollen contamination or they do occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, would you be hesitant to use
one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, again, I'm trying to move away from
males.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I probably wouldn't use it unless it
had some special set of characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if it is like, you got to remember,
we can confirm all these things now using
[SPEAKER_03]: lab data or genomics, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you have a plant that is free
from markers associated with the male sex
[SPEAKER_03]: and you self that plant, and then you find
that plant, you know, you find a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that comes up as we'll call it in quotes,
male, you can send that lab, that plant to
[SPEAKER_03]: the lab, the DNA lab, and see if it has
male markers.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it does, well, it's a pollen
contamination, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if not, and it's a plant that's just
producing male flowers for some other
[SPEAKER_03]: reason, you know, one of these weird
genetic anomalies that we were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about before, then to me, those are also
interesting from a research point of view.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, let's figure out why.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I don't think that I'd be more
likely to use them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, cause I just don't, I don't know what
benefit that it would add, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd probably self the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd probably try to self the plan and see
if I could, you know, would that trait
[SPEAKER_03]: pass on, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was telling the story the other day too,
when Rob and I were in Morocco,
[SPEAKER_03]: we were walking through these fields with
thousands of plants and we found this one
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that was, it was a female.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but it looked for all intents and
purposes like a male, but rather than
[SPEAKER_03]: having male flowers, they were female
flowers, but the morphology of the flower
[SPEAKER_03]: and the way the growth habit and the
stretch and everything, it was a,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it was a, it was a male,
it was a, just a bizarre, one of those
[SPEAKER_03]: weird off types, like those really rare,
you know, one in 10,000 kind of genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: anomalies or it looked like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, you know, it was, it was just,
it was, it was neat to see because it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not something that you see all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if I ran into something like that,
yeah, I'd probably try to breed it out
[SPEAKER_03]: just for the anomaly of it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to see, is this, can this trait be
passed on or is it something in the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that's just reacting to the environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understandable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, yeah, it could be, could be one of
many things, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it could be anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And until you start doing the experiment
or experiment and analyzing it with the
[SPEAKER_03]: tools that we have available to us,
you can't actually figure it out,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, everybody can hypothesize,
you know, do be is a great, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Louis do be the breeder for, uh,
for ACE.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, he really knows what he's
talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also another super nice guy in the
industry, just a really good person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, he knows what he's doing,
but there's, you know, I have another
[SPEAKER_03]: friend in Spain.
[SPEAKER_03]: He lives there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's actually Jorge Cervantes and he goes
to these like neighborhood meetings.
[SPEAKER_03]: He went to one meeting and some guy showed
up with a male cannabis plant and like an
[SPEAKER_03]: August and he, he ranted and raved at
everybody in the neighborhood meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, this is a male cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to destroy it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you, you guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're all pollinating my stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's kind of an inevitable thing
with cannabis pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it does travel on the wind and,
and depending on what's going around your
[SPEAKER_03]: neighborhood and how, you know,
how serious the year about your filter
[SPEAKER_03]: intakes on your grow rooms, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pollen can get in and cross, you can get
cross contamination.
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially if you're doing other types
of breeding around, I mean, it can happen,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So before I would really believe that a
male plant came from an S1 seed line,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd want some actual data to be like,
okay, let's actually just confirm your
[SPEAKER_03]: hypothesis and say, yeah, let's look at it
and say, are there genetic markers,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, or the, is, does it look like
there's a genetic contribution from an
[SPEAKER_03]: outside plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can figure all that stuff out now
because we have all these tools at our
[SPEAKER_03]: disposal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I think that the growing and
breeding community really needs to embrace
[SPEAKER_03]: these kinds of technologies rather than
being afraid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it makes sense just to utilize the
new in the, in the current.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that brings us to our final
five questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love these questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask them to every guest, always get
great answers out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is what's your absolute
most memorable strain or bud or hash
[SPEAKER_00]: you've ever smoked?
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that stands out more than any
other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think again, it's probably nostalgia,
but there's a friend brought me something
[SPEAKER_03]: that he had, he had, he worked at a,
a, a backcountry cabin up in the mountains
[SPEAKER_03]: of British Columbia one summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he came back to the town that I lived
in and he had this, this flower and it was
[SPEAKER_03]: grown from an Island out here on,
on, in the Vancouver Island straight or
[SPEAKER_03]: the straight in between Vancouver Island
and the mainland, a little hippie Island
[SPEAKER_03]: called Leskeetee.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this plant was called Leskeetee
sweetie is what they called it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was some kind of haze variant and
it was so ripping strong, at least to my
[SPEAKER_03]: memory, it was like really strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if it was that everything
else that I was smoking back at the time,
[SPEAKER_03]: keep in mind this is, I was in high
school.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was, it was so much stronger.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it was just so much
stronger than what I had been smoking or
[SPEAKER_03]: it really was this anomaly plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that one really, I remember it
really whacking me more than anything I
[SPEAKER_03]: had ever said.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've never, of course, never been able
to track it down again to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: duplicate the experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was a memorable one.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many, I mean, you know,
when I came back from Morocco with Rob,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, I got, we, we, we both had the same
meal the last night in Morocco,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I had mayo on, on the fries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was like a garlic mayonnaise that
they had put on my fries, which I
[SPEAKER_03]: shouldn't have, should have known not to
eat in like a country like Morocco.
[SPEAKER_03]: But of course I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got the worst case of food poisoning
I ever had, like salmonella.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt like I was on my death bed
coming back.
[SPEAKER_03]: From Morocco to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, I mean, there was people on the
plane that were trying to kick me off the
[SPEAKER_03]: plane.
[SPEAKER_03]: They thought I was spreading Ebola to
Europe and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I really, I really didn't look good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so we ended back, we ended up back
on, you know, I was, I ended up sleeping
[SPEAKER_03]: on the floor in Rob's apartment for a few
days because my host in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_03]: David's wife, she's had a surgery and
she's immunocompromised.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I can't just show up, you know,
puking bugs all over the place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and stayed on this little cushion on
Rob's floor and, um, Simon had,
[SPEAKER_03]: he had met with Simon when we got back and
Simon had brought a little jar of Cali
[SPEAKER_03]: mist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I remember lying on the floor,
trying to like keep my bodily fluids in
[SPEAKER_03]: check, smoking a joint of Simon's Cali
mist grown in Amsterdam by Simon.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a pretty cool thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was a little, not everybody
gets to have that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That must've been very, very memorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess on the opposite end of the
spectrum, was there ever a strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: just got hyped up phenomenally and you
were really excited to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you finally got it,
you were just a bit unimpressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, tons.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, you know, Vancouver,
unfortunately it was full of that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, we kind of classified them all into
this category.
[SPEAKER_03]: We called Bimbo Bud and they were like,
you know, it was what the, the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the brokers that were always running
around Vancouver, trying to buy all the
[SPEAKER_03]: weed to send down to the states that I
kind of kept away from those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I always thought they were just a
heat score, but that was the kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that they were looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, um, Bimbo Bud was just lime
green, really bright, kind of white.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and it all kind of just smelled
generic and you know, everything just kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of fit into that thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was so many of those that were
just disappointing, you know, sugar shack.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: J Bud, there was a ton of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were all really just biker grown hash
plants that were stuffed full of
[SPEAKER_03]: hydroponic nutrients and really,
really frosty, but not very, not very much
[SPEAKER_03]: punch to the, you know, to their
appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next one is if you had to be
dropped off on a sort of deserted Island
[SPEAKER_00]: left to your lonesome, you can only take
three strains with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What strains are you going to take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kill me, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'd probably take a, a hydropenoline
variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd take something in that hazy kind of
sweet skunk family and it's tough call.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd probably, it's a tough call.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's, it's, it's, that's my
nightmare, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: To be limited to three.
[SPEAKER_03]: How unfair would that world be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I used to only give people two.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cookies OG, something for the beta
carry-offing class.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, as much as I rage on the cushions
there, there is a beauty to them,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, I've got a very sweet spot for
cookies myself, even though people like to
[SPEAKER_00]: call me a fan boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is, is the opposite end of the
last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say instead of you being marooned on
the Island, someone you're not the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: fan of is getting marooned on an Island
and you get to pick the three strains they
[SPEAKER_00]: get left with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to leave?
[SPEAKER_00]: them with?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do unto others as you would have others do
unto you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you give them the same as what you'd
take?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very diplomatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the second guest to have shown that
they have a bit of humanitarian in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So final question for the interview and
one of the fan favorites, if you could go
[SPEAKER_00]: back to any point in history, anywhere
around the globe and presumably collect
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds or a cutting, where would you go and
when?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I would take the seeds and it would
have to be in the heyday, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: before, you know, I was born in the
seventies, so I'd probably want to go back
[SPEAKER_03]: into the sixties and late sixties and go
to all the hotspots.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd go to Columbia and Thailand and,
you know, India, Southern India,
[SPEAKER_03]: like Korea area, Kerala.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pakistan, Afghanistan, back when it was
friendly to do so as a Caucasian person,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, really don't want to go all
those places.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the reasons that,
you know, one of the things I really
[SPEAKER_03]: respect and love about David is that he
went and did all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get to learn as we do all we will do
when we respect and appreciate our elders,
[SPEAKER_03]: we get to learn from them, you know,
and learn those experiences through him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had some incredible experiences
traveling around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a shame that we don't we can't
do that today, but we can do things today
[SPEAKER_03]: that they couldn't do back then,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a trade off, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there any shout outs or comments you
wanted to make before we wrap up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just much love to anybody growing
the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't spray chemicals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, much love to our elders,
you know, the folks that led the way for
[SPEAKER_03]: us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mel Franks and Rob Clark's and David
Watson's and all those people,
[SPEAKER_03]: even Neville.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you got to give respect,
you know, again, David says this thing and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's true, we all stand on the shoulders
of giants, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We wouldn't be where we are today without
the efforts of so many people that have
[SPEAKER_03]: contributed to the community and
contributed to the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let's just keep moving it forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it'd be great if we can,
like I said, we get legalization and you
[SPEAKER_03]: get to experience, you know, a legal
regulated system down under and.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, all these different places in
the world that need it, Europe,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's make it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a sentiment we can all get
100 percent behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for, you know,
