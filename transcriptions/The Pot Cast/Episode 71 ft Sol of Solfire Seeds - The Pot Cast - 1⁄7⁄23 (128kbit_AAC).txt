[SPEAKER_01]: All righty, friends, we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a big thank you and welcome to the man

[SPEAKER_01]: seen going around, undoubtedly a legend in
the Pacific Northwest scene and just a
[SPEAKER_01]: great guy in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thank you and welcome to Soul of
Soulfire Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on the show again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for having me back,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, super keen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost been a year since we last
chatted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's flown by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems like that was a quick year
because it doesn't seem like that long to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like we were just talking about
the Bahama drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess it's kind of flown by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, hey, you touched on it yourself,
I guess, for a man who's been as
[SPEAKER_01]: productive and as busy as yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not hard to understand why the
time's flown by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a little bit of a rundown on
what's been going on for you in the past
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did the Bahama Mama drop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it went amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for us, it brought in a lot of new
growers, maybe to the Soulfire brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: just the way that we revealed it and just
unfolded it for people on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing our reveals, showing the pictures
that we grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just thought it brought maybe a lot more
people into the fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I guess last time that you and I
got together, that was a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about that was the first drop of
Bahama.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this year we did the second volume of
it, which was much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sold out pretty much instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just as cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're on to other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, to answer your question,
I think the Bahama was big for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Soulfire brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep seeing just crazy heat that people
are finding in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to 100% agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That drop, in my opinion, was one of,
if not the biggest in the past couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years, in fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a number of questions sort of stemming
from what you just answered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the first place to start is,
I noticed that the part two of the Bahama
[SPEAKER_01]: Mama drop was a little more limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was curious to ask, is there any strains
out of that drop that you think will come
[SPEAKER_01]: to gain a bit more notoriety, even though
maybe you didn't get quite as many packs
[SPEAKER_01]: out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the weekend at Gary's,
I think it was our first opener with a
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary Strain or a Gary Cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: That and the gas Nana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things that we just saw in
that, which the gas Nana was Banana Runs
[SPEAKER_00]: with a Gary Payton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just some of the banana flavors that
we saw in there that weekend at Gary's is
[SPEAKER_00]: so just greasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's such a good breeder that Gary,
I think those ones are going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: when, when people really dive into them,
I mean, I had to, I did a remake,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I don't know a lot of people,
I guess, is the first place you'll hear
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I haven't told anybody this,
but I did a remake of a lot of the strains
[SPEAKER_00]: that we ran out of that people fell in
love with from the Bahama drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like Bahama Berry, which was from
volume one, we'd sold so many of those and
[SPEAKER_00]: people just keep asking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many ones that they love of
that same thing with the weekend at
[SPEAKER_00]: Gary's.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I remade some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also did some BXs and, um, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we remade the Bahama S one,
um, because that went out as a freebie and
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first month of the Bahama,
the first Bahama drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think we gave up,
gave away like 30,000 of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so now we've remade the Bahama S one
as a, as a retail pack, it will just be
[SPEAKER_00]: priced at our normal, our normal pack
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll, that'll drop sometime after
this mine for maybe a month or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: month or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but to answer the question,
I think out of, out of that second,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that second release, I think for me,
weekend at Gary's is probably going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: one that we see a lot of the, um,
I don't know the lemon peel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the lemon peel cross the Bahama
peel there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that hash lovers, once they really
get in there and they start finding the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the turf profiles in there, like when we
were trimming up all the testers,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my God, I was trimming it with a couple
of hash guys and they were just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: walk out the, out the door with their,
all the bags they trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, I'm writing my name on this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking this one home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just, there's just so much in that
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had more of, I wish I would have
had more of them to share with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a great answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of the strains you mentioned was
some of the ones that I had sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: earmarked myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's funny, you mentioned
the Bahama berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I popped a pack of that myself because it
caught my eye.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are speaking to the Testament of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the gas, the gas Nana, man got,
got some traction behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Undoubtedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people I've spoken to are really
excited for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting pairing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you describe the flavors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get the banana coming through or is
it more dominated by the Gary?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the banana comes through strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a little scared to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I was like, Oh,
I don't know exactly how this is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Gary's a great breeder and I know
the banana runs that I was using was very.
[SPEAKER_00]: Candy banana, very creamy, Laffy taffy
fake banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know, if I can get,
if I can get what I'm looking for out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this, which is like a, a greasy gassy,
but yet still fake banana smell,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'll be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to say that like we
accomplished that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a, there's some green Finos in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's like some jet black Finos
in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our selection of that, the one that we
kept, which I didn't even find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, so, uh, our partners here in,
in Seattle, uh, no mids, they found the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that I actually, um, I actually kept,
I found a bunch of great ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the ones I pictured and showed were
great, but the one that he found is just
[SPEAKER_00]: so intense with the banana turp,
like that fake candy banana turp I had to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to keep his and it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the base best way I can explain
it is like a super mechanic shop,
[SPEAKER_00]: greasy smell, which I believe comes from
the Gary and then that fake banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something completely different than
you'll see in a banana runs, but very
[SPEAKER_00]: intense, very intense, great taste too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we're on the topic of a greasy
gas, I noticed that the Mando sold out
[SPEAKER_01]: very quickly from the Bahama mama series
and not, not surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that you'll re look to remake
that one at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it was extremely popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, maybe I don't think I'll remake it,
but I may, I may go through it and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and use it later, later in another
project, but I don't have any plans to
[SPEAKER_00]: remake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't in our, in our remake
schedule for, um, for the ones that we
[SPEAKER_00]: just remade with the, with the Bahama.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, short answer, no, not looking to,
to, uh, remake that one, but possibly look
[SPEAKER_00]: through it, hunt a bunch of them and maybe
find something to work out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And would you say that in general,
uh, one of the sort of strategies you use
[SPEAKER_01]: as a breeder is that you do look to
continue the breeding forward each
[SPEAKER_01]: generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you say, you make the Mando this
cross and then next one, maybe you breed
[SPEAKER_01]: with that and like, keep working it
forward or do you sometimes just go back
[SPEAKER_01]: to the same thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I generally don't go back to the same
thing because I don't know, we try to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to keep it unique, but if you've
watched the pattern of Soulfire,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, over the years, you know,
we've been out like six, seven years and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of our, a lot of our lines come from
our original black banana line,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, a lot of them build on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I would imagine to see some
offshoots if we sign, if we find something
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing, but you know, the, the Bahama
that came from the original black,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, black banana line, uh, you know,
the, the Dawn mega that came from our
[SPEAKER_00]: original black banana line, this mind
flare, you know, it's, it's a few steps
[SPEAKER_00]: from that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that was from the white jelly,
but still, you know, originated from that
[SPEAKER_00]: original work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we just want to see how far we
can, can push it and how, how much we can
[SPEAKER_00]: improve it, I guess, if that makes any
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to loop back to that,
but I got to quickly ask you this
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been personally curious about,
did you name the strain Don mega after
[SPEAKER_01]: your dog or is the dog named after the
strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, the dog is named after the strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that is a cute dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I would love if this dog was
called Don mega.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like such an imposing name on this
cute little dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully, so that's a, he's a lilac
fluffy Frenchie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any of them here in,
in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I got them from my buddy who,
you know, he breeds and shout out to a
[SPEAKER_00]: King County kennels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I got them from him and dude,
he's just the most lovable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have, I have another, uh,
and I have a female, a female Merle that I
[SPEAKER_00]: got from a friend as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I bought from a friend and I'm going
to pair those two together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're like soul fire selected
Frenchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to have a bunch of litters.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, you know, I'm not jumping in the
dog game.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my, not my thing, but,
um, I do find it super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you should see the genetic,
um, profiles that come with these dogs,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they break it down to the allele.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's really cool to, to see the
breeding that's going on with these dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to have one litter,
maybe two litters of some soul fire pups
[SPEAKER_00]: and that that'll be it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wife will lose her mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: She already doesn't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Merle one you mentioned, she's a
cutie.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I saw the photos of her, I was like,
man, I don't think I've seen a Merle
[SPEAKER_01]: Frenchie before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Merle's are, are, are super cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, she's got, uh, she's a,
she's a chocolate, chocolate tri,
[SPEAKER_00]: tri Merle, Coco tri.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got like Coco paws and then like
that cow, that cow print look and just a
[SPEAKER_00]: personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's super small.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like 22 pounds and he, he's like 20,
he's supposed to finish out about 25
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds, 25 pound fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that, uh, the breeding you're
going to do is just, just regular release
[SPEAKER_01]: only, not fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not even regular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have to go, go and get these guys
a C-section artificial inseminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a whole process that,
yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wouldn't want to do all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the, at least the breeders that I
got my dogs from, they don't, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: like puppy mills.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't keep their dogs in cages or,
you know, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're like family dogs and that's
how our dogs are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, anything less than that,
I wouldn't, I wouldn't deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, no, they're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I didn't really know that I was
going to fall in such love with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, they got great personalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's go back to a question that we
normally start the episodes off with.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you been smoking on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so right now, mostly a lot of,
a lot of hash rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm smoking mostly the fucking mind
melcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: I washed a bunch of it when we did our,
when we did our, our test for the,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the mind flare run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so that one, I mean, that's our
first done mega fam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, yeah, yeah, that's the
mega mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, uh, the mega mind is what we watched.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't watch the mind melcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's what I've been smoking on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I been using my puff go just cause I
could travel around with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just got to travel around with
that fucking thing when I'm on the run and
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I, I actually, uh, put some in
some little pens just for me in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for the me and the homies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just give them, pass them out some pens
and, and dude, it blows, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes I forget, you know,
when you put, when you have hat,
[SPEAKER_00]: like good hash rosin in a, in a fucking
pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I was in the, this is a horrible
story, but I was in the, uh, grocery store
[SPEAKER_00]: the other day and I was like, I was in the
meat aisle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at some shit and then I just
rip on this fucking pen in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just blow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I guess I forgot where the fuck I was
at, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look over in this like old lady is
looking at me like, what the fuck are you
[SPEAKER_00]: doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she just got hit with this cloud.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, Oh God.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's, it's, you know,
the thing about those hash rosin pens is
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually smell like pot when you blow
them out, I guess is the more of the point
[SPEAKER_00]: of the story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really smells like you just smoke some
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whereas a lot of these other like pens
and shit you get from the store smell
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't know, not like weed,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that's why I enjoy those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's what I've been smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just a little bit, the hash that I
made, I got some, um, Bahama, Bahama berry
[SPEAKER_00]: flower from nomads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I smoked a joint of that the
other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, I had a nice strawberry
stripe, nice strawberry on the exhale,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is fucking, so I can't wait till you
grow yours and we'll see if you get the,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you get the strawberry on the exhale,
you're going to have to let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, super keen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll, I'll keep you filled in and,
uh, for everyone listening, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: we specifically going to drop this episode
on the first, when, uh, the new mind
[SPEAKER_01]: flayer release comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why don't we use this opportunity to
sort of dive into it and take a little
[SPEAKER_01]: quick rundown of some of the strains in
the drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless yeah, let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've already sort of spoken about
the mind melter a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What sort of additional characteristics
would you mention about this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say that it's specifically made
for the concentrate enthusiast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, I wouldn't go that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I just, I can't go that far because
I haven't washed a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I washed the mega mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched the mega mind and that's the Don
Don mega with the mind flare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I already kind of knew that that was
going to wash just cause you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Don mega washes so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, I had a bunch of them
that we tested and I had this one that was
[SPEAKER_00]: just monster big, huge plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it was ugly as shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was super ugly, but I was like,
Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was feeling that I was feeling the,
the, the nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I think this thing's probably
going to wash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I did the trick where you
you cut off a nug and put it in a,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a glass or a jar of ice and water and
shook it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looked like a snow globe in there,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I called up the homeboy and I was
like, man, I'd sent him a little video of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I, I froze that one and
washed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the shit that I was smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I can't say that, that,
uh, you know, the everything in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't make a claim like that until we
get some more feedback from other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but there's a lot of cool stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A man of integrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, some breeders would just
happily say that every strain washes very
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I can't, I can't, I can't,
uh, I can't attest to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I washed the mega mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dumped for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like really pretty, pretty hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I try to only keep the best and I
still got, you know, I don't keep like the
[SPEAKER_00]: full spec, like all the bags are in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I felt like I got a really tight
return and I was happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for a washer,
Don make is always a good choice,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, to go with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mega mind, other than that,
you're on your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Figure it out for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, mega mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: My apologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a brain fart there when I said mind
melter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next one I'd love to ask you about
is the auto madness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this one looks beautiful based on
the, the photo you posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other day and the, the parental
lineage is very appealing to a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people, especially those who were
particularly impressed by some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: photos of the biddies you put up in the
Bahama mama drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: What sort of plants can people expect out
of the auto madness?
[SPEAKER_00]: Super frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one I've seen it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now we've seen growing with dragon,
which is like a soul fire team member.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not familiar with them,
um, he's a moderator in our discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been, he's been, you know,
growing our stuff for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a YouTube channel, a great guy,
super helpful dude, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he'll answer any question you have,
just like I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, he's always there to answer
questions for, for growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always send him, we don't have
testers at soul fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not anybody can just test for us or
any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but we have a few, few different
people that have been with us for years
[SPEAKER_00]: that are, you know, passionate about the
brand and just growing pot in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, generally guys that grow in tents at
home, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because that's, I think my base is
mostly guys that grow at home and which
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very proud of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he grew it and fucking crushed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then I saw no mid Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, I was just down there looking at all
their ones and they're crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that structure of the biddies that
people really loved in that color,
[SPEAKER_00]: that pink magenta, that pop, um,
comes through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the mind flayer gives it to like
some more stack, even though it was
[SPEAKER_00]: already kind of that blockhead was already
kind of stacky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the frost, which I was surprised
on because the biddies itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it wasn't the frostiest for me,
at least that blockhead cut the one that I
[SPEAKER_00]: used in that cross, it wasn't the
frostiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but these ones that come out from
this, which cross are insanely frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good, it's a good choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it's kind of got like a fruity
parfait, like a fruit yogurt smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely, if you're into colors,
you're into frosts, um, and you're into
[SPEAKER_00]: something finishing early, like the,
the, those pictures that we, the picture
[SPEAKER_00]: we put up from the biddies reveal,
dude, that's day 48.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's day 48.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I saw the exact same thing when I
grew up and I saw the exact same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I just saw down at NoMid Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're at the same, they're at the same
day as, um, Dragon over in, in Michigan
[SPEAKER_00]: and there it's, it looks to most guys,
they would call that done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously Dragon and NoMids and
myself were taking it to 63 for me as a
[SPEAKER_00]: rule of thumb, I like to take everything
to 63.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but these look damn near finished at
48.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for a fast drain,
if you're looking for something to be done
[SPEAKER_00]: quick, uh, utter madness is probably,
probably something you want to go for,
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, you sort of touched on a,
a general thread I wanted to swing by you,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was that at least from my
perspective, it seems as though there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some amount of conscious decision-making
going into trying to beef up the yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like as a community,
we've sort of backed ourselves into a
[SPEAKER_01]: corner with some of the hype strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like more and more, it's just
accepted that you're going to get smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like your work, largely
speaking, has all of those exotic
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics, but as you just
mentioned, you're trying to pull the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering times down a bit and getting a
bit better structure and yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this something you did consciously
think about, or am I just like wishful
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when I looked at the Bahama
line, there was some crosses in there that
[SPEAKER_00]: were extremely heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the Bahama berry heavy,
uh, NF Sheesh could be very heavy creature
[SPEAKER_00]: panic, heavy, but some of the other ones
were not as heavy as I would like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still frosty, still beautiful,
still everything you want to see in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in an exotic strain still have the turps
still taste amazing when you smoke it,
[SPEAKER_00]: just all the things you want, but we're
trying to maybe make that stack better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, whereas the Bahama would be a
lot more flower, very little leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: great for trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, you know, there's just a little
bit of elongation in there that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to, on this drop, trying to
shorten, trying to fill in that stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that's, you know,
what, what Mindflare brings to the table
[SPEAKER_00]: is an amazing stack and a faster,
faster finish, a faster ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then like a, a chocolatey more
greasier turp to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like, uh, in my opinion,
from what I've grown and what I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: grown, um, it, it really brought some
frost to it, which I wasn't expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was expecting a lot less frosts to be
honest, um, from the mind, from the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mindflare drop, but we got lucky and we
got, we got some frost out of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't, it wasn't what I was
breeding for with this, with this drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy accidents are always welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we're on the topic, give me a
little bit of a rundown about what it was
[SPEAKER_01]: about the Mindflare when you first saw it
or whenever it happened that made you
[SPEAKER_01]: decide this is the next, uh, pollen donor
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: What impressed you about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it was the smoke on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, well, the smoke and interesting
story that, that the Mindflare that we use
[SPEAKER_00]: from this actually came from, uh,
my, my good friend, Vic from King County
[SPEAKER_00]: Kennels who, who had grown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave him a box of, uh, of beans way back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he grew that and he was like,
bro, look at this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I came over and looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has like all these crowns and,
and, and fingers coming out of it and wild
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and just super, and he was like,
and you know, it finishes super early.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, dude, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me, let me get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I held onto it for a long time and
grew it a bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: The homeboys grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grew it, you know, they model cropped
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, dude, I love this shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, shout out to Vic for,
for turning me on to, to that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I think that happens a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, we have a tight group of friends type
group of growers that we hang out where we
[SPEAKER_00]: all grow shit together, you know,
and, and if they grow something of mine
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or anything, they, they were like,
Oh dude, this is tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should, you know, check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think you need that, that
community and then to select from I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky enough to have it really.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you said, it's sort of a testament
to the work that can be done when you have
[SPEAKER_01]: like a bunch of friends helping out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just thinking of that saying,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it takes a village to raise a
child.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost a bit like that to find the
right pollen donor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Soulfire, I, you know, I,
I love coming on and doing podcasts and
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the company and,
and, and being on discord and talking with
[SPEAKER_00]: people about, you know, the brand and what
we're doing, but it's no, by no means me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's a, it's a big,
it's a big thing to get it done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a big thing to get your seeds
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big thing to select plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's not just me at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bunch of people that make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they weren't there or they weren't
helping me out, it wouldn't, it just
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't be, it wouldn't be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's no one man band over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the whole team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to the whole team, as well as
your lovely lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know she does a lot of work behind the
scenes as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, she, she does the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Undoubtedly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we take a look at the next mind
flayer drop, one of the really caught my
[SPEAKER_01]: eye was the turn, because I don't believe
I had seen you use the rose cake before as
[SPEAKER_01]: a, as a mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a little bit about the rose cake
and then how did the turn work out with
[SPEAKER_01]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one, I will say, so we got that
from Bellevue cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had it, they were growing it for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just loved the turp on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this, the, the creaminess of it,
the, the cakiness of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was always a big fan of like,
I don't know, the cake, your strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the wedding cakes and things like
that way back when they were like the cool
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, you know, and, and, um,
just the look, you know, me, I love pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love pink pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's under represent, you know,
under represented, um, out there in the
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, it was unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It totally caught my eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know what,
let me grow this a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it a few times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably sat on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Months and months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I grew it quite a few
times before I really was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what, let's, let's put this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, then we had to grow it
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we had to grow the progeny out and
the progeny, the smell is just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the fruity, cakey smell is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you think the, the strain turn
ended up incorporating, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mind flare and the Rose cake?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think, I mean, I, I think it's at
least going to bring that the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the time down, not that the, the Rose cake
was even a fast, uh, or a long flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I just think with the mind flow,
we're always bringing it, we're bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: these times down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, you know, the one,
I think it might be the next one that we
[SPEAKER_00]: reveal actually, it just, it has a lot of
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has, it has a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think really the Terp is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm trying to select for good smelling
things that, that people are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we got to get some different stuff
out here, you know, cause it's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can only have gelato so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love gelato gelato is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we can only have so many variants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, um, and we just got to try to
maybe that's why the Bahama was popular
[SPEAKER_00]: with people because it was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was some different,
there were some different characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, same thing with the mind flare,
some different characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's kind of what the Rose
cake added to this would be something
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, that's a great way to sort of
put it in just as a personal thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, um, what you're saying is a
hundred percent correct, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there can only be so many gelato.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also feel like you've done a good
job of helping to incorporate into work,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also do it in a unique way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you look at like the why you
jelly and all the work that's come from
[SPEAKER_01]: that, I think there's a strong argument to
be made that like, while there is gelato
[SPEAKER_01]: in there, it's really like not just gelato
or even gelato derivative.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've sort of turned it into your own
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that that'll be a sort of
method you use going forward in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, yeah, maybe there is cookies in a
cross, but it's not like you're regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's, I think what,
what you said is what, um, I think every
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder should do, every seed maker should
do is try to make something your own,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like it's anybody can take two,
two hype cuts and put them together and be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Oh, this is that, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But make something your own, make it
individual and, and unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then incorporate some of the
flavors that are already kind of out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that what you make is
something new and something all your own,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though it may have something that
we've seen before, but you incorporated
[SPEAKER_00]: your own flavor with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's, it's all new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, don't just take two,
two cuts that you, you pick up at the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer's market, slap them together and,
and think you did something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you got to kind of, you got to
make something first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that's a sentiment we hear
echoed by many guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have asked you earlier,
but I think now's a good time before we
[SPEAKER_01]: keep moving on.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I popped those Bahama berry seeds in
Minecraft, if the Australian federal
[SPEAKER_01]: police is listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I, when I popped those seeds,
they raced out the gate and I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful, healthy seeds, what I want to
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it got me wondering, cause I
don't actually ask this question enough on
[SPEAKER_01]: the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long do you think it takes for a seed
to become fully viable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in the past, I think I've said to
someone, as long as you give like the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed, like six weeks on the plant,
it should probably, you know, be pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you, do you let it really go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've heard some people like,
they just let the plant go to like 13
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks, you know, cause it's just like more
is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you stand on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we talking about when we're harvesting
seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just cause a lot of our
listeners like to make their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long do you think it takes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not take that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had this debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm making seeds, I'll, I pretty much
run the plant the same amount of time as
[SPEAKER_00]: if like we were flowering the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if you let them go for too long,
those seeds will start to crack and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start to, they'll split open and the seeds
will still be viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they look weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you'll see along the edge,
there'll be like a little split opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't know how long those seeds
will probably hold, hold on the shelf as
[SPEAKER_00]: much when they have like an actual area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or hole in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think to answer your question,
I, you know, I'll bring the plants down
[SPEAKER_00]: about 63, um, hang them and, and let them
just completely, completely dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine, and this is just
anecdotal, um, that those seeds are still
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening while they're drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're still probably going through
like, uh, you know, some sort of growth
[SPEAKER_00]: process of ripening on the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I give them a long dry while
they're hanging mostly because it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely irritating to try to sort seeds
in any kind of stock that's still wet or
[SPEAKER_00]: not a hundred percent bone dry,
especially for the way that, that we do
[SPEAKER_00]: it, our technique by using the easy seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let them go to 63, hang them up and
then let them, you know, get a solid,
[SPEAKER_00]: solid drive, maybe two weeks even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then easy seed them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they should go into your,
in your, uh, refrigerator for a
[SPEAKER_00]: winterization for, I don't know,
a month to 45 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful info there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had seen those cracked seeds before and
I did wonder what the situation with that
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I got a surprisingly really good
germination from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really was a bit confused because I
was sort of expecting them to not germ at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those ones that have the,
if they have a little crack in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're, they're generally, they generally
pop just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're going to sit,
you know, make it like 10, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause sometimes we pop seeds that are like
10 years old and have no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as they keep refrigerated,
not in your freezer, but refrigerated,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, seeds will last a decade in my
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, people freak out man,
about seeds are like, Oh, these seeds are,
[SPEAKER_00]: these seeds are so pale or these seeds
don't have tiger stripes or these seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: are dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds are like Finos, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every plant has a different, different
looking seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Don mega seeds are super pale,
beautiful germination, cookies and cream
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds from, from Mike super pale,
like white pill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeds are different and don't think,
Oh, this one doesn't have tiger stripes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that tiger stripe shit just rubs
right off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the outside coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just, you know, it's just,
it's just seeds, seeds are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't remember like a gorilla glue
back in the day, anything that you cross
[SPEAKER_00]: the gorilla glue, absolutely itty bitty,
tiny seeds, tiny micro seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some great info there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a, you mentioned earlier,
you know, you, you make a lot of seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you give away a lot of freebies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm imagining you must end up with
a lot of like, I love giving away
[SPEAKER_01]: freebies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we give away freebie?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we give away freebie shit here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, let's do it, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll do it through our discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was inspired by your discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to your discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone go check out the soul fire
discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably a very redundant
statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably already on there because
it's so good, but please go check it out
[SPEAKER_01]: if you haven't, but yeah, bro,
let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give away, we'll give away some
shit, however you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it on your discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll send a, we'll do a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one of these mindflare boxes,
give it away on your discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: People get them stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, I'm going to have to be like
five hundred renamed entries in that cross
[SPEAKER_01]: because this box is insane and we'll talk
about it soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did just want to quickly ask you before
we move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is the best thing to do
with all of the, uh, material that's left
[SPEAKER_01]: over after you've shucked all the seeds
out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it sounds like you dry it till it's
really crispy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the seeds come out easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think's the best thing to do
with that spent material, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just throw it away because there's
something, there's some sort of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, chemical change that happens
when a plant is actually pollinated versus
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just left to the flower and never,
you know, and never get that pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, all that extra material,
I just, I just throw it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it would make anything very
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it smells great and it looks pretty
decent, but yeah, no, I don't keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, and the way, you know,
the way I do it, I do it in like a big
[SPEAKER_00]: pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, uh, like a barbecue pan or like
a baking pan type deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I, uh, shuck a plant off in there
and then I'll just, you know, with gloved
[SPEAKER_00]: hands, just sit there and break it up into
the finest material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, then you kind of like pan
for gold to get your seeds to go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just remove that top layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I run it through the easy seed
and boom, it just, it just cleans them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, it was absolutely hell before that
machine to be honest with the volume
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only imagine the frustration before
you had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh God, it was a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to hear the easy seed has made life
easier for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just mentioned the, um, the box you're
doing and I love, I love the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a concept that's catching on
among the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess before we delve into the specifics
of the mind flayer drop, I'd just like to
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly ask, do you think you will look to
do a box going forward with most releases?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, sometimes I can, it just depends
on how much stock we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there's a new phenomenon
coming on in America where, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro stores because of the farmer bill
and because of seeds being, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: quote unquote legal now, um, hydro stores
are carrying seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just walk into a shop and buy
seeds here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to change the landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when it comes to everything,
breeding, um, where you buy your seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff, how it works, uh,
breeders may need to scale up who knows,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but this is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing we can do to, to,
you just might as well roll with it
[SPEAKER_00]: because, um, that's going to be the new
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I like to do a box because I
feel like I can give people a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I try to generally try to keep it kind
of small.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as like, uh, how many strains I put
on a lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's by, it's by design that we
only do six to eight because I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous to think that somebody is going
to go out and buy, you know, 18 of your
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and spend, you know, these guys
will put a, a lineup of like 18 different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want $200 a pack for every strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do six to eight hundred bucks a
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the sole fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standard right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in a box, you just get all kinds
of freebies and free shit and fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it's, it's affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this box, particularly we, um,
a lot, most of the time we just let area
[SPEAKER_00]: 51 handle it because the logistics of
getting them out to people are a pain in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ass and area 51 is local.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easy for us and let them deal with
the headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this time, um, I just went crazy,
pissed off the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just stopped and just said,
you know what, let's make sure that every
[SPEAKER_00]: bank that wants 10 of them can get them,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, every, every verified bank
had an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every verified vendor had an opportunity
to get 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be able to get them from,
from them if they, if they got in on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful to hear because, uh,
if, if the listeners haven't seen these
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes are very generous and there's a lot
of cool swag in there, particularly some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the seeds in there that I've not sure
you can get elsewhere, or at least not at
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and you never, and you never will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I put in, it's one or the other
on, on the hood candy freebies that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, you'll get them in the box and
that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, they won't be in part of the
hood candies drop there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, uh, you know, a lot of cool swag
in there, especially the hood candies
[SPEAKER_01]: freebies you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, if people have been paying close
attention, they might've picked up some
[SPEAKER_01]: little clues that the hood candies
feminized, uh, lineup is in the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to give us maybe a little idea
about what it was about the hood candies
[SPEAKER_01]: that stimulated you to look at it as the
next line to work forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just loved, I mean, first the
community loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always, they've been asking for it
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of just hadn't done it because we
had all these other projects going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, you know, I was just like,
all right, it's time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's, let's do this, but we got to do it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got to have the right crosses
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one, we're really going for flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this one, we're really going for
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's what we're going for turps
on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we bred for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it's in testing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really can't, it, it may,
you may see it pop up in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just really depends on how,
how it goes.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just got my brain sort of ticking
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you try to have a certain amount of
releases per year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like say two a year, or is it really just
like up to the whims of how it works out?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really up to the whims of how it
works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it could be none a year if,
if everything just comes out or it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: meet the criteria, um, to stay relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you have to, you know,
keep it unique, keep it fresh has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fire, you know, every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it, I'm kind of going for a soul
fire signature look, like if it has that
[SPEAKER_00]: signature look, if you can look at my
pictures, if you can look at things that
[SPEAKER_00]: other people grow and say, yeah,
that's soul fire right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even need you to tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need you to tell me who,
who grew that or who bred that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's a soul fire strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what we're striving to
become something where you, you look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, and the only way to do that
is through proper selection and being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to say no, or being able to say,
this doesn't make it into the line or
[SPEAKER_00]: this, this whole line doesn't make it out
to the public.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, you know, you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes things just don't, don't make
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though we talk about it now,
you see some freebies in a box or you,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some, you know, whispers of a,
of that line coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't make it through our quality,
it won't be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great to hear a good sort of
quality assurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess to talk a little more general
about say, how could I phrase this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're sort of trajectory as a
breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly have noticed that you're,
you're doing things in this very
[SPEAKER_01]: professional sort of way in the sense that
like, often I don't even hear about your
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of breeders, they'll tell you,
Hey, I'm testing this out, blah,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your work it's professional in that it,
you just hear about the drop coming and
[SPEAKER_01]: the testing's already happened and you
didn't even know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder, is this something you're
intentionally doing moving forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it certainly feels like it could be
a paradigm shift where that's how breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: start working where it's like,
you don't really know what I'm doing right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, but you'll hear about it in six
months.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that's how they should be
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not growing, if you personally
aren't making your seeds and growing your
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, then you shouldn't be dropping your
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that, it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you make something, you grow it and
you feel like it's awesome and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome for you, then you can have
confidence in giving it to other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, there's no, there's no like,
this is the upcoming dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happening for sure because I want it
to that's that's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, I can't will it to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to happen because it was quality
enough for it to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's probably how a lot of
breeders, maybe, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I only really fuck with like my
Mike and the guys in my circles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the other people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really pay much attention to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I would hope that's how they do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I think it's going to be a growing
trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I always love it when I log on and
I see a new upload from you because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: usually a very mouthwatering picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we just jump back to the hood
candies, you know, we mentioned it's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess with everything we've said so far,
it might be a bit of a no brainer that
[SPEAKER_01]: people look at the block monster and
think, Hey, this is the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a little bit about the block
monster that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and the mind flayer drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that thing is it's just got this
chocolatey Z turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's, it was again,
a fast, fast vision finisher, super
[SPEAKER_00]: frosty, uh, really vigorous like early on
in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it was a bully.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it got its name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was growing just so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, you know, bullying its
neighbors around in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, and this thing is a monster in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, it was, it was a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really a fun one to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people are going to be really
happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to see a ton of great,
a great, uh, Finos that come out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love, I love when people get it and then
the joy that they get from growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a huge part of this for me,
the, the reward I get from the happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the actual joy that people get from
growing in our strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I talk to them every day, every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I, if you post it on Instagram,
you'd be, don't be surprised if I pop up
[SPEAKER_00]: and like it and, and, and say something
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, if you're growing my gear,
I'm, I'm behind you a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm you, you'll hear from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did see on Instagram, someone posted
up a cross called Californian demon,
[SPEAKER_01]: the LA Cush cake cross mine flyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it got me wondering how many crosses
do you make when you initially do a
[SPEAKER_01]: lineup?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you had to guess what percentage of
them make it through to the end stage of
[SPEAKER_01]: like getting to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make a lot, uh, we, we make a lot
and we grow them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't, I don't know, uh, uh,
a percentage of it, but we, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we make a line, it starts out very
big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go through there and we look
at who, who gets to stay, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: which crosses are good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times, a lot of them are
amazing, but just didn't work with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The design of this lineup, it just didn't
work with the flow of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, I'll look at it and I'll
pick out which one do I, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this one's going to be a great soul fire
slap or sometimes, sometimes a soul fire
[SPEAKER_00]: slap might not even be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a soul fire slap is such a,
it's a, it's a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what that, that California
demon is the soul fire slap is such a,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a community engagement, uh,
uh, a group thing, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times those aren't even tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those just go out as a soul fire slap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You slap up a sticker, you, you,
you put it, put it in discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if it's awesome, I'll post it on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get posted, you get a free pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that, that, that California
demon is dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've seen a ton of those that are
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, to answer your question,
we make a ton and then we whittle that
[SPEAKER_00]: down to that six or eight that we think
people are really going to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keen to hear some more about some of
the ones that you've tested with,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I did want to quickly mention it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you, you spoke about, you know,
your home is with exotic Mike.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really drift too far outside of
your immediate circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: People would probably be aware.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if not, you definitely need to get
onto it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been doing, uh, your own podcast
with Mike, the grow life with the bros.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it been going for you being on the
other side of the mic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, I, you know what, you know,
how that came about is I was just so
[SPEAKER_00]: inspired by our first meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're such a good host.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went back to Mike and I was like,
man, you know, I hate, I never wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: do these fucking podcast things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause honestly, I don't like it to be ever
about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's not about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was saying before, soul fire is a
team, like from the guy in his,
[SPEAKER_00]: that grows at home to, you know,
soul flower in the, in the office that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sends out everything to all the
workers in there, to everybody else,
[SPEAKER_00]: like are so much more important than me in
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I never wanted to be like front for
face forward front in front of the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but then, you know, I did your,
your, uh, podcasts and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: really enjoyed hearing about, about,
you know, the story and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, man, Mike, we should do
one, but we should just do a podcast in
[SPEAKER_00]: discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's live where we can give away stuff
and interact with the, uh, interact with
[SPEAKER_00]: the audience just right there and really
just bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's what we do all the time
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the guy calls me, you know,
every morning, when he's out for his,
[SPEAKER_00]: his jog, and we just bullshit about
everything that's going on from politics
[SPEAKER_00]: to pot to just what's going on in our
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so pretty much every morning,
we'll have a two hour chat about just
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we wanted to put that in front of
people in kind of a funny way and interact
[SPEAKER_00]: with people that, uh, that enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Hey, you were the, you were the
inspiration for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are way too kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's I'm just being real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I've tuned in and listened to them
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the, the live interaction
component that is one of the aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: this show.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what did you think about Mike's rap
verse in the start of the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I still want to get Mike on the
show, so I'm not, I'm not going to comment
[SPEAKER_01]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's an open forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say how you feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: People love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it when breeders kick back and have
fun with the fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember a while ago, Mike would do
those, um, talent nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: On his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were always fun to watch as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he was like with the milk and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he'd just like get two random people
on the live and just be like, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: debate each other or like just do
something fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember, I remember the, uh,
like, uh, the talent shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had some, dude, there were some people
in there with some actual like real talent
[SPEAKER_00]: that were doing some crazy things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember one time this guy just beat
boxing and he was great at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna tell him he needs to start a
variety show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the guy is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'll give them that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like me, I'm more of a more conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a little bit more reserved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, Mike is like just so
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes he's like the class clown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So together it's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good times for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, everyone makes sure to tune in for
the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I believe you post about them on your
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just keep an eye out for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be a fun one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next one will be, I think the 29th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so by the time this air is a little
already passed, but we do it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every other we try to do it every other
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe we should get you on there
as a guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like flipping the role,
the role reverse all the way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look, I would not turn that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very appreciative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we jump back to the strain list from
the mind player, there's sort of only one
[SPEAKER_01]: that we haven't touched on too heavily,
which is the soul sonic.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you feel the Gary paired with the
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I felt it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know, man, like that for
anybody who is doing any projects or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or, or working any lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a little, um, I dunno, I was a
little resistant on using the Gary at
[SPEAKER_00]: first I grew it and I liked it and I
thought it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was really good pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but something special happens when
you, um, when you breed with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it breeds amazingly well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we put it with that and you can
just see from the, the picture that I
[SPEAKER_00]: posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did like a get re, um, a pre,
a pre exclusive with that soul sonic on
[SPEAKER_00]: four 20, where you could get it just for,
I think a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and just from the pictures of it,
like the way the leaves are the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had so many keepers of it that yeah,
I, I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to narrow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I think that's kind of what
how, how you make it into a line in our
[SPEAKER_00]: camp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can, you can test something and
be like, ah, you know, I got one keeper
[SPEAKER_00]: out of like a bunch or, you know,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have one that it's like hard to
find a keeper, cause you have so many
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers, you're just like, ah,
I can't keep all of these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I, I should, you know, that's how you,
that's how you make it into the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was definitely the case with,
um, with soul Sonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that Gary just puts his gas,
like a greasy gas on, on pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: everything it, it touches.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's great to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I specifically wanted to ask you a few
people have said that Gary, and even as an
[SPEAKER_01]: extension cookies can sometimes be a bit
of a bully in crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's so dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you find that that's the case?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you think it's just a matter of
pairing it with something that's equally
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a bit of both representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you need, I think it's,
it's, the pairing, I will say that one
[SPEAKER_00]: that Gary is kind of a bully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it definitely leaves its mark on its
cross, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it, it has this greasy residue that's
on the, on the flowers that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that just, man, when you smell
it, it's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way that it breeds,
but yeah, it's a, it's a bully for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say that all the cookie strings
are like that, but that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's progeny are better than
it itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things it makes are better than the
original.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I've got you here, I want to ask
you, cause I got to admit, I wasn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly familiar with the cake mix
before you sort of introduced it with the
[SPEAKER_01]: baby cakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me wondering, do you have any
strong feelings on cherry pie?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's sort of starting to make
a little bit of a comeback, but I've also
[SPEAKER_01]: never really heard you speak about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any strong thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it grown a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember growing it back in the day and
had some stability issues if you had the
[SPEAKER_00]: right, the real cut of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had, it had definitely had some
stability issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think with how, you know,
the modern Gardner is a lot more savvy
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to, you know, dealing with
problems, dealing with intersex issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now we've, we've grown,
we've all grown enough cookies to know how
[SPEAKER_00]: to spot and, and deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a much more educated,
I guess, landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also just recently reacquired the cherry
pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to grow it again to like
re-familiarize myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it is making a small comeback
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the flavor and the turp
of it, when it's grown, the right way is
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely got some unique sort of
characteristics about us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may hear more about it in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to ask you, I feel like gas
has had a bit of a resurgence in the past
[SPEAKER_01]: few years as like a general flavor type.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say that you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think it's still on the up and
up or we're sort of plateauing a bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think one of the cooler things
about, you know, cannabis and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding is the locales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like certain areas in the country,
like certain flavors, if you go to LA,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love gas down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you go to the Bay, maybe it's
more Z Tert, more cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they still like gas too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just different areas of the country,
like different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know like New York went on a crazy
tangent for like sour D.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was everything had to be sour D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these things, they come in waves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in in, in different regions,
have different popularities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think gas is always going to be
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's just going to resurge and
it'll die down and maybe like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like a Z Tert or a cookie Tert
will pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just kind of what makes it
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard about, have you heard about
some new gas that I don't know about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm going to need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I was hoping it was going to be
coming from you to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's hot on the, what's hot on the
radar?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you, what have you seen lately?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard about, I've seen hardcore
OG S1 getting a lot of traction recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: There must be like a specific S1 that
people have found that's really special.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't, but I'll be investigating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I know that your, your reach spreads
far and wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully next time we chat,
you got it in this table.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can give me an update at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like, it sounds like it might be
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm always looking for,
I, I'm, I'm always looking for what the,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the other guys are doing,
you know, like, um, I'm, uh, I'm just like
[SPEAKER_00]: all the other, I'm just like any other
seed guy that I buy everybody seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: every other greeter, any breeder that,
that is out there that, uh, looks
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've bought your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it and I'm popping it currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go through a lot of different people's
stuff, looking for unique things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if, if, you know, anybody out
there is thinking about doing like making,
[SPEAKER_00]: doing projects, breeding, I think you
should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I think you should pop
everybody, you know, popping soul fire
[SPEAKER_00]: school and you're going to find some heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find some stuff you love,
but, but pop everybody's go pop Mike
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, go pop, whoever pop other people's
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find all that heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's how we're going to get the
new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like it's come, it's become so
mundane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like where's the new flavors at?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm, I'm waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's the heat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the longest time I've said that I
think the, uh, the wheels of our community
[SPEAKER_01]: metaphorically spin on people popping
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, it does a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if, if you're sick of seeing the same
strains or you're sick of their not being
[SPEAKER_00]: a new flavor, then start popping seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not popping seeds, you're part
of the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, you're going to find those
somebody, somebody has it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be soul fire stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be whatever, but they have it in
their garden right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're probably never going to post it on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably never going to tell their buddies
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably don't even have a clone of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to come and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, uh, it could be the, the raspberry
mama inside heavy days tent dropping soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it could be, you never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be anything like, like,
uh, I, I'm sure with all these new growers
[SPEAKER_00]: coming online and all the beans that are
getting popped, there's some, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: cool shit out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just got to, we just got to be,
as you would say, privy to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have your finger on the pulse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was interested in asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm particularly keen to get my hands
on one of these boxes because I noticed
[SPEAKER_01]: inside it is the mind flayer S one and I'm
not sure you can get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tested those at all slash what am
I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we expecting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I grew some, just, uh, a nice,
it's, uh, it's really close to the
[SPEAKER_00]: original, the original mind flayer that I,
that I grew and, and used for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, those are in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not part of the drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only get it in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll only be X amount of them,
uh, out there, you know, so enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to, I like to make things very
limited because I, I feel like that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you know, cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you were in that moment,
if you were there to, to get those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you weren't, then maybe you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You missed the boat guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't be left.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't miss the boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, and we do that with a lot,
like our last supper cross that was out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the, in the, um, Bahama line guys are
always asking us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Oh my God, we got these last supper
freebies with like some banana runs packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are the most amazing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So frosty, the terms are crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are they at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where can we get them?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't, if you didn't get them,
if you didn't get that freebie for that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, it is gone and we're not remaking
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we do that on purpose for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, be there in the moment or be,
be wanting, or maybe you could find it out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you know, like guys have shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But while we're on the topic, I would love
to hear, cause I know sometimes this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: hard one because you, you tend to want to
know a bit more info before you give an
[SPEAKER_01]: answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you could only recommend one of the
mind flayer crosses, just as that you
[SPEAKER_01]: think is sort of a crowd pleaser,
what would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a follow-up, what is your personal
favourite of the drop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I, if I was a guy and I was looking
at the menu and I was just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what, I can only get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one am I going to get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'd probably go, it's hard to say
cause they're all so different and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, you have different reasons for,
for getting something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I was a guy looking for something
to wash and I was a hash guy, I'd go mega
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I was a guy that is going for like
bag appeal, really can't go wrong with any
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a hard question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utter madness is, is an awesome one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just had a hundred bucks and I had to
pick one, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough because like, like I,
like you were talking about earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we designed this line, we put each
one in here for a different reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they all have a reason why they're
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's your personal favourite?
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I don't have a straight up personal
favourite cause I can't, I couldn't choose
[SPEAKER_00]: like soul sonic over mind melter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just couldn't and I couldn't choose like
mind melter over mega mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I don't know who would be my
personal favourite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suggest like a mind melter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you're, if you're new,
uh, to soul fire, you won't go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if, if I was, if I, if I never
heard of soul fire before I had,
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred bucks to spend and this is going
to be my, my, um, my intro go mind melter,
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberry mind melter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to kill the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll fall in love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, there that's, I guess that's
what I'll say.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, yeah, I think like the
heavy yields and the turps are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, just to loop back quickly,
you mentioned a little earlier that you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you pop a lot of other breeders
stuff and you're familiar with who is
[SPEAKER_01]: doing what.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was curious to ask, are there any
strains or breeders that have caught your
[SPEAKER_01]: eye recently?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I mean, I like, I definitely
like what like Bloom is doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, uh, with his turp profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I, I've been popping a bunch of like
older, older stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was, uh, I popped some TGA stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: What stuff?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like, so just like a bunch of stuff,
like some of his, uh, his, this was a
[SPEAKER_00]: while back, but his, um, his train,
his blood wreck crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I think that it was, it was named
as, uh, uh, what the fuck was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Chernobyl is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't pop Chernobyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't find any, any of any keepers
sadly, but, um, it was like a corkle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a corkle cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, crazy train.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the crazy train.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so Mike has this huge, uh,
thing full of seeds, tons, like dude,
[SPEAKER_00]: from all over the years, I have a big
vault, but he has like a huge vault and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, he gave me a bunch of crazy train,
uh, seeds and I, I popped those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't find what I was looking for,
like turp wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So none of them really made the cut,
but, um, and that's the case with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll, I'll pop a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be some heat, there'll be some
tight stuff, but it just has to like make
[SPEAKER_00]: the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, that and yeah, I'm always
buying, I'm always buying seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a buying seed problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I think, I think we're all addicts
in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just out of, uh, like a, a general
sort of curiosity slash follow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember in the last episode,
we chatted about, uh, the Flav being one
[SPEAKER_01]: of your memorable ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know that Miss Jill is putting
that out again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can get it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder how, I mean, I wonder how like,
like close to what it, what it was before
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you know when that's coming out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'll definitely grab them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it, it might even be out
now, but you nailed it on the head.
[SPEAKER_01]: The I've got a question about that purely
because the original, it was like Romulan
[SPEAKER_01]: by a space queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Ram, the Romulan was heavy,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, there's a lot of like,
you know, question marks around Romulan
[SPEAKER_01]: these days, but on top of that,
they also listed as peach Romulan and not
[SPEAKER_01]: just Romulan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, oh, is that their way of
subtly tipping their hat that it's not the
[SPEAKER_01]: same?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that wasn't what the original one
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did they put up any pictures of it or
anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I can tell from like the pictures,
how similar it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's the, the Flav that we used was
very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the one that Mike selected,
um, it was very unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I'm, I'm trying to pull it up on my
phone now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on Miss Jill's page.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it should be like kind of eggy and
like big, big, bright green or bright
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to send you a photo off the
upside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to pull it up, but I can't find
her Instagram right now when I'm under the
[SPEAKER_01]: crunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always like, dude, everybody always is
getting deleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so, yeah, it's so terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the reason why we went to,
to discord, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The constant persecution on Instagram is
horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if anything is going to actually
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's like, you can like,
you see paid advertisements for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then also people getting banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't think it's going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to change until it's
federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rock can, the rock can take down a
bottle of tequila and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing against the rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, God forbid, like you
post some pot, then you could just be
[SPEAKER_00]: banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it is the, is the, like the,
the weight that they give, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: the report like, so sometimes you'll get
reported for, uh, hate speech or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or all this other crap that has not,
you know, that's a right, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a, it's not even what it is,
but, um, they'll pull your posts down
[SPEAKER_00]: because somebody said that you were,
you know, being abusive by posting pot
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't even make any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's definitely, it feels a bit like
the wild west, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just over, over policed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy because you know, you can watch
somebody literally get murdered on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that doesn't come down,
but a guy posts a plant and it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, you know, he loses his whole account
that he's had for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that discord will become even
more popular than what it is now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I told, so I wish I could take
credit for like a lot of cannabis guys
[SPEAKER_00]: moving to discord, but I really can't like
Lem here in, in, I knew about discord
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, just for my kids playing like
video games and me playing video games
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took over, um, for like team speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we would use team speak or
ventrilo back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, discord came along and my kids
were like, Oh dad, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: discord is away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first used it, I was like,
this shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not that intuitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much different things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't into it at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a while, and I was able to
figure out how to kind of use it and how
[SPEAKER_00]: versatile, versatile it is, I was like,
Oh, this is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, there's a, there's a breeder
up here in, in Washington named lemon,
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon Hoco, uh, lamb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a discord, a cannabis discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was, you know, they got a lot of
different stuff going on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got all this stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that's when I first saw the idea
and I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I set up the soul fire discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have any barely any followers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd basically just sit and chit chat in
there with like me and dragon and just a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of the regular guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and you know, I told Mike about
it and at first and, and, and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then at that point, then like,
uh, Masonic started his own discord and he
[SPEAKER_00]: started, you know, getting his thing
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, I was telling Michael,
I was like, Hey man, we, you should do a
[SPEAKER_00]: discord bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, nah, I hate discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: That shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like how I was when I first saw it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he's like, nah, this shit sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, after a while, after he just
had had enough of it with like Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: he, you know, he started doing his NFT
stuffs and he, he set up a, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and, um, then we are a discord
rather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he just kind of got used to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of guys who maybe aren't
that tech savvy or it's not that intuitive
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're going to, they're going to
come along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, um, I mean, really that's where
the core core of the soul fire basis is in
[SPEAKER_00]: discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to help you have problems with
the plant pop into discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got 7,000 guys that are ready to help
you answer a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want daily giveaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing them every day at four 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get, uh, you know, we're giving
away a pack of beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want, uh, to post your pictures of
what you've grown and what you've grown
[SPEAKER_00]: and show off and show other people what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just the community interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In there is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you couldn't ask for more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a modern day forums,
I would say, you know, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, yeah, it's, it does have
that, um, longitudinal ability to track
[SPEAKER_01]: threads and things like that, which is
definitely something people have been
[SPEAKER_01]: calling for, for a long time, which is
like really great to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as, as your discord illustrates,
you can really get them popping with a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of different functionalities and sort of
various different things happening at
[SPEAKER_01]: different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of reasons to be on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it takes a lot of work too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have, I have an entire staff of,
um, moderators that are in their 24 hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: some at different time zones so that like,
you know, we can just keep it like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a positive space that's, um,
about what we designed it for,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is growing pot and talking to other
people about growing pot and sharing,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, tech and sharing ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like we have a whole area just
about getting your setup, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A whole area about, you know, every
different facet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you really get to know
these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in discord, you have pretty much
24 hour access to the breeder who's making
[SPEAKER_00]: your seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can talk to them about,
you know, whatever at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that right there alone just
changes the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you set up a discord, just be ready for
the, uh, the bumps here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's just so, so many different
things you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge functionality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge functionality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to mention that one thing
we hadn't actually spoken about yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit off the topic of the discord
is where, where do you think like the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor demands are going in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what do you think is going to be the
next big popular flavor to take the scene
[SPEAKER_01]: by storm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think, I think gas is like you
said, making a comeback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's cycling, cycling back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm waiting for like a new flavor
profile to pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just talking the other day about
like watermelon strains and how I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never, I've never tried a strain that they
say tastes like watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to, if you have one out there
and you're like soul fire, there really is
[SPEAKER_00]: a watermelon strain that actually tastes
like a watermelon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't not like one that's like banana
or like strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like orange or apple, like our,
our apple, our apple pucker strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: was in the Bahama is amazingly like apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to see that flavor profile
take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just saw, I was at the homeboys house
the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was growing his, uh, his pucker ups and
it was crazy apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see like a flavor like that,
like a true, a true apple come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where we're, where we're
going, uh, as far as flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly can attest that I haven't
really come across, uh, many true apple
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's neat to hear the apple pucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to get onto that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the watermelon, I haven't
likewise haven't ever really come across
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but I think Bodhi says he's got a land
race, Africa, African hash plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, I can't remember if the
Ethiopian watermelon hash plant is what he
[SPEAKER_01]: calls it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, that, that's getting a bit wild
and untamed to be dealt with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, he, he had a lot of great,
he has a lot of great flavor profiles and
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, I haven't popped any of his
beans for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the last thing I popped from him
was like, uh, what was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like an Akai or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to, I have to circle back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you writing it down right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got some cool stuff in there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to circle back and give him a,
give him a, uh, a little test pop there
[SPEAKER_01]: and see what we can find out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever come across like a real
passion fruit flavored strain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a, like a guava.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually another point that I'm
only just starting to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a passion fruits like common where
you're at, like the fruit passion fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we, it just rains all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't, we don't get any of the cool
fruits that you have down there in
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, because it's like, I was talking to
someone the other day and they said,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, I've never had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it made me realize like, yeah,
I guess I just take it for granted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just such a commonplace fruit down
here that, um, anyway, it's like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like a, a sour tart, not like super
sour, but like a tart, a version of like
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a mango with some more floral
influence in there, more like citrusy
[SPEAKER_01]: almost, but beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But another flavor profile, which I feel
you don't really come across very much
[SPEAKER_01]: like in that same vein as the apple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe, I don't know, maybe we just
haven't haven't, I, I, I believe that this
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the flavor profiles that we have
right now, that's there's no way that this
[SPEAKER_00]: is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just, we haven't created them yet,
or they haven't been discovered yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like somebody is going to discover them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you know, back in the
seventies when they were growing pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was pretty much just skunky,
skunky pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, there wasn't all these strawberries
and watermelons or, you know, and all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different flavors, they,
they weren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk to people all the time and they
just seem so like down in the dumps about
[SPEAKER_00]: where cannabis is in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about like the flavors that are
around, they, they talk as if we're at
[SPEAKER_00]: like the peak and it can never be better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't think that that's the
case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think, I think we're,
we're nowhere near the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're, we're still creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's so much more stuff for
like, like new guys coming on to like
[SPEAKER_00]: create.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's so many new breeders
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be cool stuff being made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's so many, like,
cause I think this plant is very well
[SPEAKER_01]: capable of producing any smell possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, where's all that stuff we
haven't smelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like whether it's, uh, whether it's me
making it or somebody that has it right
[SPEAKER_00]: now in like some seeds that they made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And dude, that's why I always encourage
people like, Hey, if you find something
[SPEAKER_00]: cool in a pack of seeds you get from me,
please, by all means breed with it,
[SPEAKER_00]: make something new, make something your
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it, you do not need to ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still get these messages all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Hey, is it okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's open source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to breed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to make your own things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to create something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have something to work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's great philosophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, I do want to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the gatekeeper of the shit at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and if they, if, if you buy a pack of
seeds from sulfur, you already know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's, it's inherently ingrained that
you have my blessing to go ahead and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and work that line, create something,
create something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did want to ask the, uh, with the
Bahama mama drop, we, we had the part two,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, after, you know, the initial success
of the, the part one of the Bahama mama,
[SPEAKER_01]: is there any chance we're going to see a
similar thing with this more recent drop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there won't be a part two of the
mindflare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There won't, there won't be a part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, of it, I think we did the part two
because of what I said earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I think it's unfair to put out so
many strains at one time and put that
[SPEAKER_00]: stress on, you know, just the common
gardener's pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Oh, here's 14 strains, but you can
only pick a couple at the, you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I much rather put out six and then six
to eight, and then maybe in six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later, you get another six to eight from
that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had that many that should go into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, but with the mindflare,
I think this is, we're just going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this, this six and, and, and that'll be
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be different freebies or maybe
different exclusives you'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there won't be a, there won't be
a, a part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, we made enough stocks so that
there's plenty of boxes that go out and
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, that'll be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keen to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess it, that further just
reinforces that there's no better time
[SPEAKER_01]: than now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys, don't don't wait around.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jump in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think, I mean, our pre orders are
insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like once it goes, it's, it's gone and,
and then, um, well, you know, we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this, uh, hood candies testing and
if the candies makes it great,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see that, you know, in the,
in winter or end of fall, maybe winter of
[SPEAKER_00]: this year, if it makes it, if it doesn't,
you know, we'll see you next year with
[SPEAKER_00]: something And we're not, we're definitely
not a company that's known for like
[SPEAKER_00]: putting up, putting out drops back to back
to back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can count my drops on your hand,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that's, that's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's most of what I wanted to
touch on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything we haven't touched on
that you wanted to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I think, I think, uh, I think we,
we, we touched bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we talked about the mine flare
drop, discord Frenchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Passion fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to pop over to your,
uh, your discord and do, uh, and do a
[SPEAKER_00]: gnarly giveaway, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, look, I would, I would be very
grateful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you sent me a, have you sent me an
invite to your, to your discord yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'll do it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I'll, I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually a little late to the party
with discord and I'm still figuring all
[SPEAKER_01]: the ins and outs of it, but I'll send you
on right now.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me one and I'll come in there and I
can, uh, I can try to give you any little
[SPEAKER_00]: tips and pointers that I know I'm not the
best at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the best thing you can do is have
a, have a kid, have a kid that knows what
[SPEAKER_00]: he's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause my son, yeah, he's great at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I bet he's, he's the mastermind.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the DaVinci of discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, that's these kids these
days, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was, uh, I was blessed in that aspect
to have him as a, as a moderator there
[SPEAKER_00]: that quickly can repair things and change
things and make things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a, do you have a giveaway bot
set up yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, God, you can get a bot for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we do all of our giveaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it takes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It totally does the random randomization
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go down a deep dive after we
get off the phone based on the sounds of
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different bots that you
can use for so many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in discord, it's just what makes it
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, ticket system, like you gotta
have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the coolest things about
our discord is that if you have a problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have, um, a customer service
problem, you have issue with what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on in discord, anything, anything you want
to talk to staff about, you just open up a
[SPEAKER_00]: ticket, say what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives us a ticket number and one of our
staff members will pop in there and solve
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's just how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I'm, I'm keen and I would love to
have you swing by our listeners would be
[SPEAKER_01]: very grateful to get their hands on any of
your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, I'm sure they're already in your
discord as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big overlap, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pop over there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When just send me the invite, when we get
off this and I'll, I'll pop over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think with that being said,
that just about brings us to the end of it
[SPEAKER_01]: for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there any shout outs or general
comments?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd like to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think that, I think that that covers
it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you having me on the show.
