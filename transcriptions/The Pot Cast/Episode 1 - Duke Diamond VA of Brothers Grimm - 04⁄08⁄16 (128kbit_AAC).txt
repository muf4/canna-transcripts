[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome everyone to the first episode of
The Podcast, a cannabis breeding and
[SPEAKER_03]: culture podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our first episode is proudly sponsored by
420 Australia, your premier clothing and
[SPEAKER_03]: lifestyle store, as well as the Brothers
Grimm Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know them, they're back with the
favorites and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: In our first episode, we have Duke
Diamond, VA of the Brothers Grimm,
[SPEAKER_03]: who is kind enough to sit down for the
best part of three hours, as well as
[SPEAKER_03]: giving us a tour of the Brothers Grimm
facility in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although this show is a podcast,
this episode was actually going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: video episode, however, unfortunately,
due to a technology gremlin, the video
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't save properly and we only have the
audio.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, this doesn't affect the interview
at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, I just quickly wanted to apologize
to Mr. Sol and Duke.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first 20 seconds of the interview was
cut out and this was when they were both
[SPEAKER_03]: introducing themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, my apologies, but we're just
going to jump right into the interview
[SPEAKER_03]: just after they've introduced themselves
as we've walked into the first mother room
[SPEAKER_03]: of the tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking at the uh, this is the Sour
Diesel Stunk Hybrid here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, the original Sour Diesel was
a skunk that came out of Virginia and it
[SPEAKER_02]: got crossed with the chem dog and that
made your Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did was I took the same genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: My skunk is from the same family and we
crossed it to the Sour Diesel to bring out
[SPEAKER_02]: more of the skunky side of things there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we have a couple of those
right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we have, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then over here, we have the same skunk
male to the chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: So essentially we've made a Sour Diesel
using, uh, just using a regular male
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of like a hermaphrodite accident,
you know, so having these two,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, we'll grow them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we'll look at the little
different traits, you know, like little
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf traits, like how thin, thick,
variegation or the serrations and
[SPEAKER_02]: branching patterns and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can take these things and kind
of assess them and we could actually use
[SPEAKER_02]: this, like maybe a male from this to the
female Sour Diesel clone and maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: outcross back to the Sour Diesel skunk,
depending on what traits we're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for, whether it be yield or something cool
like that.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're almost doing a Sour Diesel IBL
in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we'll put it into a seed form to
where like, you know, everybody chases
[SPEAKER_02]: down that clone and with that clone,
they, they kind of screw up, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's a lot of fake ones,
you know, and everybody over here wants to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a special little snowflake and they're
like, oh yeah, we got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ain't got shit, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ain't got nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got some bag seed from something that
ain't even sour, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty cool that if people could
actually like grow that in seed form and
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to experience that too and be able
to like sprout seeds and actually have
[SPEAKER_02]: them come up sour and diesel and,
you know, have something good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just for everyone listening,
you're referring to AJ's Sour Diesel as
[SPEAKER_03]: the original?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like he didn't breed it or anything,
but the guys up around Albany and up in
[SPEAKER_02]: New York City, those are the guys who
created her.
[SPEAKER_02]: A friend of mine on Instagram,
he goes by skunkva.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, he's the guy who traded him the skunk
for the chem dog back in 94.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are, that's the crew that made
the Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an accident really.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, it got made.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I was wondering, how did,
how did you tie into the whole chem
[SPEAKER_03]: family?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, back in, uh, let's see, I think it
was, uh, 2004.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I met, uh, got a chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody called him back in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was mass G for Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And G was his, uh, initial of his first
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: That just kind of bumped into him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going and hitting up like music
festivals and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, we decided like,
Hey, let's hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had a cutting of, uh, you know,
ironically enough right now, Cinderella
[SPEAKER_02]: 99, which is all that stuff back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's all Cindy, but, um,
so he really wanted that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we get together and we're smoking and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, yeah, you know,
I got this, uh, this stuff I grow called
[SPEAKER_02]: chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, yeah, man, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and here we are at this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the, uh, chem dog D right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, he says, uh, yeah, try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, he's a really big guy too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge hands, big burly dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he gives me this little tiny,
tiny bong and he's like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took, I took two hits off of it and I
started to sweat, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean fucked up like a suit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sandwich man, like really, really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, you think it's any good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, you damn right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, what do you want it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had taken him up some claims,
a skunk and white widow and bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: bunches of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: G 13 hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyway, he gives me this and,
uh, gives me a whole bunch of stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: super snow dog and whole bunch of cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, uh, like over here, this is the
original.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the, what they call the 91.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it also goes by the skunk VA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my buddy, he's, uh, he's the guy that
kind of held her safe for, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 something years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but that's her.
[SPEAKER_02]: She, uh, she was a little more viney,
you know, a little more lanky and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, man, let's kill her, kill her
weed on earth though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's just so, so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, hell, everybody's always
like, God, so much like OG and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here, this is the, uh, triangle Kush
here, which is actually like the mother of
[SPEAKER_02]: all of what they call OG strains,
you know, she's from Florida in 1992,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, you can kind of get a look at
that structure and like how, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: she's very notey, you know, and then like,
you can look at the dog and you can kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of see some of those, some of those same
traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I hear a lot about the, uh,
the history of OGs and you hear about
[SPEAKER_03]: things like the creepy and, uh,
obviously triangle Kush quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You, you think it's pretty definitively
triangle Kush?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so like, uh, you, you heard of a
cornbread Ricky before, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's pretty big on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's got swamp boy seeds and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's the guy who gave that triangle its
name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I don't know if y'all know about like
the, uh, mysterious things of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the, uh, Bermuda triangle,
you know, where Amelia Earhart was flying
[SPEAKER_02]: and got lost in it and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way I got that name was,
yeah, stuff would fuck you up so bad,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would, yeah, you get lost where the
hell you're going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they ended up calling it the triangle
and like they're from Florida too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, you know, that name kind of stuck,
but me and him have talked and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: these, these plants, uh, I can't really
get into it too much, but these plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're, they're very, very, very closely
related.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it all boils down to a couple of people
that were doing some things kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: running in the same circles, but just,
uh, you know, that type of deal old
[SPEAKER_02]: illegal world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just staying on that same point,
um, a lot of your plants, they look so
[SPEAKER_03]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's unbelievable how old some of them
are.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your opinion on how to,
um, keep you clones nice and vigorous,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, not letting them go to crap over
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would say the, the number one
thing to do, um, so I'll tell you what,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, I'm going to take y'all on a tour to
the mom area here where we keep our old
[SPEAKER_02]: mother plants and all these good things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably a little bit quieter too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like right here, this is a,
a master Kush from 1996.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice big broadleaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the key I would say is,
you know, you keep a plant healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now when my cousins gave me this back in
the day, you know, we kept things pretty,
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I got busted DA back in 2007 and I had
some friends, you know, keep cuttings here
[SPEAKER_02]: and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my one friend, we used to call him the
butcher because like he'd keep a gray
[SPEAKER_02]: room, 110 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd have spider might see what and feed
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, plant looked like utter dog
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you get a cutting back from
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, this looks terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even think this thing's going to
live.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you take a cutting and,
um, I'll throw y'all a little trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you got something really,
really sick, um, the plant cannabis plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: they put off a, it's called salicylic
acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's part of their, their immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, like to us, like be like me and
you getting like some antibiotics to help
[SPEAKER_02]: us beat an infection or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you do is you get a aloe vera
powder or aloe vera water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's very high dose of salicylic
acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can water it with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's something else called neem
cake that, uh, is really rich in it's
[SPEAKER_02]: called acid, dactrin, uh, all these things
help to support that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you give it that, and then you're
also, uh, you know, like me, I'm a soil
[SPEAKER_02]: guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's all organics and soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you got a good microbial life in
your dirt here and, uh, you got what it
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to eat and thrive and you got a good
light source on it, um, you can make that
[SPEAKER_02]: clone look great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I told you that, you know,
before you're seeing this, that when I got
[SPEAKER_02]: this clone, it looked like something
barely alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you treat it good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow out a big, nice mom like this,
and then you start taking good,
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy cuttings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you keep that good, healthy
cutting, long as you keep it healthy,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, you know, they're good for years and
years and years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you'll have to excuse me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like some of these, like this one,
we just got through taking a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of clients, man, for new breeding program.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, but this one here, this is from
1984.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an urban poison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But still just as big as this can be
kicking ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over here, we have the airborne G13.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot the exact year, but I think it's
somewhere around like 86 or 88 something
[SPEAKER_02]: along the lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, man, keep it healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then over here, we got the 88 G13 hash
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been hacked on a little bit for
cuttings and all, but the one in a nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, man, the one and only man,
the thriller.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, just kind of looping back to the,
uh, that other point you made,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, especially in terms of talking about
the kind of the biochemistry behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love, uh, the Krebs cycle posts you had
on your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I personally know that,
uh, you're an engineer, but I was
[SPEAKER_03]: wondering, did you do any, uh,
like biology or biochemistry courses at
[SPEAKER_03]: all?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you seem to have a fairly good grasp
of that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they, um, so the, the, the school I
went to, basically they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, y'all are a bunch of country
pumpkins and like, you guys, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you better learn how to work on a car or
wire something up or weld something or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you kids are going to be
screwed, but they also say where I'm from
[SPEAKER_02]: is big, uh, big agricultural area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we grew a lot of tobacco, um,
soybeans, tomatoes, you know, about
[SPEAKER_02]: anything you can think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we grow a little weed back in the
woods, you know, a little supplemental
[SPEAKER_02]: income, but, um, we, we, we did have like
some pretty decent little classes in high
[SPEAKER_02]: school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they weren't like very advanced,
but it was enough to really get my
[SPEAKER_02]: interest peaked.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, man, a little cheap library
card.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do all the research and I could,
and anything I can learn, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to pick it up and then I would apply
it and I'd say, okay, that's good or it's
[SPEAKER_02]: bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just kept the good things and left
the bad shit behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, yeah, it's, uh, definitely helps
if you, you know, you get into a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of the biology and that gives you a
pretty good fundamental on, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: how plants work and photosynthesis and
chloroplast and chlorophyll and all these
[SPEAKER_02]: different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can understand why something
does what it does, when it does it and how
[SPEAKER_02]: you can help facilitate that, that's all
the base knowledge you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, when you start finding out
like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these plants, when they're stressed out
or pissed off, well, they, they want to
[SPEAKER_02]: start producing salicylic acid to help
their responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, think about what's this plant's
response, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like why does it produce resin?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's horny, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wants pollen and wants to catch pollen
and get pregnant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, man, it's fucking bright in here,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to produce sunscreen as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also like, you know, hell man,
like, right now, so that is plucked that
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf off right here, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I plucked that leaf off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't know I plucked that leaf off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It thinks something's eating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now it's sitting there saying,
oh shit, something's eating me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What should I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of its responses are, you know,
putting off resin for sunscreen to get
[SPEAKER_02]: pregnant or maybe to produce more toxins
or in our case, drugs like THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when this little rabbit eats this
little leaf, he's going to think,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's going to think twice about it because
he's all fucked up now, shaking and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just kind of learn how to stimulate
responses and then facilitate those
[SPEAKER_02]: responses the best that you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's aloe water, salicylic acid,
you know, or coconut water with enzymes
[SPEAKER_02]: and cytokines to help it produce more,
you know, plant material, in our case,
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers, you know, and you're just trying
to, you know, give it everything it needs
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as kind of tease, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the horse and the carrot,
you know, you dangle it in front of the
[SPEAKER_02]: horse and it gets you going.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: More or less, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess this kind of brings us into
this kind of domain of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: how much of breeding and high quality
production is science versus say an art,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, there's always this debate of
science versus art.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I frequently hear of people
like your friend, JJ MYC of Top Dog,
[SPEAKER_03]: and people will talk about how he has this
knack, this hunch for picking males,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think at the end of the day,
a good breeder is just mostly going on a
[SPEAKER_03]: scientific approach or there's a little
something extra involved?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the eye that people speak of,
you know, like when me and Saul walk into
[SPEAKER_02]: a room and we're looking at plants,
what's striking in our eyes where we say,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, we're looking at a certain trait in a
plant, it's basically that we've done it
[SPEAKER_02]: so much that it's a learned thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So technically it is science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're basically boiling down to gene
pairs and frequencies of these desirable
[SPEAKER_02]: gene pairs, things that we like that we
want to see more of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say for instance, so I make that
strain, Grimtica, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You seen them big ass buds, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the mother plant, the hash plant,
it grows buds, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the biggest one's probably about,
you know, oh man, it looks huge because of
[SPEAKER_02]: the punch in my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, y'all are millimeters and
centimeters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a bud would be like the size of an
ink pen, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The longest one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now on the other side, it throws colas
that are the size of a man's forearm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if I want to see those forearm buds
on that female plant, I can say,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, in our male, we know that,
Hey, you know, he, he looks like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other male looks like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other male looks like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could say that male one has a
thinner leaf, maybe a particular smell to
[SPEAKER_02]: the stem rub and say he's a thin and
sweet, say male number two is super wide
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf and a little more fuely and say male
number three is something in between two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if we look at the sisters of these
males, we could say that male number two,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the kind of big fat leaves his
females, you know, counterparts,
[SPEAKER_02]: his sisters throw big, huge colas,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So these two traits could be linked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So big fat leaf could also be linked to
big fat bud and floral cluster,
[SPEAKER_02]: or it could be the opposite, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would know to say that,
okay, so the male that I'm wanting to roll
[SPEAKER_02]: with could be this big fat one if I'm
looking for yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take this big fat wide leaf thing,
I'll pollinate this hash plant and then we
[SPEAKER_02]: look at the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now in the, in the progeny,
man, we're looking at these children and
[SPEAKER_02]: these kids, man, we noticed that,
you know, you're still going to see these
[SPEAKER_02]: thin leafed phenotypes, you know,
that maybe had the smaller bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're also going to see the other
phenotype with the wider leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you notice, Hey, throwing big,
huge buds again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could refine this a step further and
take like a, you know, a male,
[SPEAKER_02]: same type deal female and take it to
enough two generation, and then we could
[SPEAKER_02]: do it again and take it to enough three.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically what you're looking to do is
if you were only trying to do that one
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, that's cool, but we're not that
fortunate, you know, our crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're looking for smell, we're looking for
flavor, we're looking for potency,
[SPEAKER_02]: yield, vigor, all these different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're trying to up the frequencies of
all these desirable things and know how to
[SPEAKER_02]: find them by these, like I said,
these gene pairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might be looking at a leaf trade on
one, come out with a smell trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could be looking at health, even the
serrations or how many leaves that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually producing on these fan leaves or
a number of different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's root mass, there's speed of
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long did the males take to get to
sexual maturity?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was always a big one for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like as far as potency, how fast does it
veg?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is veg slow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is veg quick?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because all the plants, they have this
energy in them, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if he's not trying to grow super quick,
that means his energy is in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: he's going to do something with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it's going to be throwing big
massive buds in flower, or maybe all his
[SPEAKER_02]: energy is going into resin production,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of it is, you know, you go off of
these things first, then you see what you
[SPEAKER_02]: come up with at the end, and then you can
assess it from there and move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another step would be instead of the
filial generation breeding, we could take
[SPEAKER_02]: these and like say back cross it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say now I'm throwing these big,
massive, huge buds, but I lost a little
[SPEAKER_02]: potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the momma hash plant, man,
you know, puts you dick in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might say, well, I'll find my male
out of that F1 generation, look for that
[SPEAKER_02]: big leaf trade again for those big buds,
and then back cross it back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: original mom and try to regain some
potency from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with kind of that same topic in mind,
we see like labs these days offering tests
[SPEAKER_03]: claiming they can, you know, tell the sex
of males before they've even got more than
[SPEAKER_03]: a couple nodes going.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you think this kind of thing plays
into the scene?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's like a fad, or do you
think this technology will legitimately
[SPEAKER_03]: find a use in most breeders stable?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that what the price of it and the
availability of it coming that I really do
[SPEAKER_02]: think that it would help if I could put
genetic markers on these things,
[SPEAKER_02]: like these pairs that I'm able to see with
my eye, it would help me along to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to say, well, it's definitely this,
you know, they're signing, it's backing
[SPEAKER_02]: this up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had these markers put into place for
yield and potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it would, it would help me along pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, you got to be a rich
motherfucker to be able to afford all that
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, guys like Soul and myself,
we've done it for so many years without
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to go to a lab, you know,
or any of these things to where we can do
[SPEAKER_02]: it, do it by eye and putting it on paper
and recording these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it does help.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other token, like, you don't
absolutely need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a nice thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong, but you know,
we can still accomplish what we're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: to do, you know, without, without the labs
and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kind of how you just mentioned,
you've been doing this for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something I wanted to ask everyone I
interview is, take me back to when you
[SPEAKER_03]: first started smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your initial acquaintance with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, was it a family affair?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it you and some friends getting up to
some mischief?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a friend in high school and
ironically enough his last name is Blunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if y'all spoke once over in
Australia or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so him and this other girl named
Jessica, this little punk rock chick,
[SPEAKER_02]: and she had some good weed and we smoked
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right then and there, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like made me feel real good and
calm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was always kind of anxious and I
don't know, a little uptight and didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really like people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I still don't like people too
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it really, it did enhance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely enhanced things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from there, I'm like, well,
I'm going to take these seeds out of this
[SPEAKER_02]: weed and I can grow tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can grow everything under the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why should this be any different?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started growing it and my cousins,
man, and they, they saw me, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 12 years old and had all these
seedlings sprouted up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, you know, look,
man, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, let's help you do it a little
safely.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, you don't end up in prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't end up all screwed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll show you how to do it the right
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically that year I turned into a
water boy and I would help them take large
[SPEAKER_02]: amounts of water through the woods,
which really sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Virginia summertime temperatures like 110
Fahrenheit, 80, 90% humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like a jungle and you got snakes,
man, copperheads and water moccasins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got, you know, uh,
hunters here, they have these people
[SPEAKER_02]: called game wardens that make sure that
you don't kill too many deer or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: the hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they also, during the summer months,
they help, uh, help the cops locate grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were showing me how to be sneaky
about it and how to hide it and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: right things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something of an apprenticeship and I
got to learn how to make seeds for the
[SPEAKER_02]: next year or the following years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, how to locate the good
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how to top them or pinch them and make
them blush out and how to feed them and
[SPEAKER_02]: how to make soil and, uh, make use of,
you know, what's around you and finding
[SPEAKER_02]: water and such.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of how I got kicked off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what was the scene like back then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it all, everyone was kind of insularly
doing their own thing amongst their kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of hill is the expression I've heard,
or was it more kind of people were just
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to work together and get the ball
rolling?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and those days, like in my area,
at least it was, um, it was something that
[SPEAKER_02]: you kept very, very quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't want to, uh, you didn't even
want people knowing you smoke weed because
[SPEAKER_02]: like if that joker man, he gets a DUI,
uh, which is here, it's driving under the
[SPEAKER_02]: influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were drinking beer and driving
drunk, you know, so in order for them to
[SPEAKER_02]: get out of trouble, they would say,
Oh yeah, officer, you know, I'm drunk and
[SPEAKER_02]: shit, but this guy up the streets growing
weed or he smokes weed or whatever they
[SPEAKER_02]: tell on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you're up in the damn, uh,
prison and then they're free.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that there was that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then other people would just bother
you all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey man, sell me a little bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want a gram or is this more trouble
than it was worth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just kept everything super,
super, super quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You damn sure that might nobody know you
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you, uh, that was, that was like rule
number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't tell nobody, nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always keep it quiet as can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on your first couple of grows,
what were they like?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what type of technology were you
using?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think more kind of interesting to me
is what was the quality like?
[SPEAKER_02]: So ironically, like, you know,
my cousins, man, they started me off.
[SPEAKER_02]: They bought stuff from the super sativa
seed club.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was their main place.
[SPEAKER_02]: They liked to get their seed stopped SSC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now as a kid, I'm like, well, I'm looking
at this magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like, oh yeah, bubble gum,
blueberry, this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh wow, look at these
pictures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that looks like the shit, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm going to, I'm going to buy this
stuff and I'm going to try to grow this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you find out that it won't that
good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So genetically, I was really started out
on the, on the right path.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, far as technology went in the early
years, I was a strictly outdoors,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, didn't really want to set anything up
inside and not that I could, I was so
[SPEAKER_02]: young, you know, I didn't, I didn't have a
place to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, so when I was 15, I got kicked
out of the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, mom, uh, caught me with a few pounds
of weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was stupid.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to stash it in my closet and
the whole house smelled like a dead skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a few pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just a few pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just trying to get by, you know,
buy some comic books.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, that, that happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, I went down to the city,
which is like Richmond, Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was able to hook up, um,
a little apartment with a buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Hey man, I could grow us
some more of this, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: all right, so I got a, uh, it was actually
a street lamp ballast and wired it up and
[SPEAKER_02]: hooked up a single bulb with a parabolic
reflector.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, which is funny because that's how Mr.
Soul's got his rigged up right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he's kicking ass with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'll tell you, man, these parabolic
reflectors, they do a pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, so I hook up one of those now
growing outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was kicking ass, you know,
I'd be real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So growing inside, it was a big learning
curve because now I don't have mother
[SPEAKER_02]: nature helping me so much, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now it's kind of all up to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's too hot, too humid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, it didn't look good,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I've been ashamed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I wouldn't show, show nobody that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so I started uh, getting some books
and I'm like, man, I gotta, I gotta figure
[SPEAKER_02]: this indoor shit out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got, uh, I think it was Ed Rosenthal
call closet cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had marijuana botany by Robert
Connell Clark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was more like a college textbook,
you know, it, it, it taught me a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: like why this cannabis plant is doing what
it's doing and why it's doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the closet cultivator gave me some
ideas like, Hey, you know, get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you get a little dehumidifier or,
you know, you're looking to keep it around
[SPEAKER_02]: this temperature or this temperature and a
lot of little tricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I took it to heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really tried, you know, and I was like,
this, I'm not having my ass, what about
[SPEAKER_02]: this indoor grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I made it happen and it turned out
really, really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just kept trying to refine it a
little bit each time, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and that's, that's the other thing,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: People all keep saying like, Oh,
that guy's a master grower, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a master, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to tell you the day you think
you got that plant mastered, it will show
[SPEAKER_02]: you, you don't know shit and it will
humble your ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you never master it, but you get a
little bit better each time you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ever close your mind, you know,
just keep it open and keep learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, maybe not trying so many
different things, but always be open to
[SPEAKER_02]: try something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something different, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if it sounds kind of weird and
crazy, like when I started doing like
[SPEAKER_02]: molasses and sugar and juice and,
you know, pouring it on these plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: most people like, dude, you're insane,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kill that motherfucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, but I mean, if you break it down into
the science of it and you look at it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, Oh yeah, that, that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, proof's in the
pudding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, try it out and you're like,
yeah, that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, just touching back on how you
mentioned, uh, RC Clark and, um,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, a few others who were the,
uh, the people you looked up to in the
[SPEAKER_03]: early days, who were your go-to breeders
and your gurus, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first people that I spoke with,
so I had a buddy, he had a computer,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have a computer, never used
computers or any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, he had internet, which was like,
Whoa, this is cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can look at porno and weed
and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had these forums, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, you could see these other growers
and they're taking pictures of their weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I was like, dude, man, that's
sketchy, crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, some of the first people I talked
to was like Vic High, um, Subcool,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, Mr. Stole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we got to really, you know,
sharing and talking about different ways
[SPEAKER_02]: of growing and, um, you know, just kind of
just sharing back and forth like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, look at this.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, Hey, I see what you got there,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you kind of pick up little
tidbits and tricks, you know, like one guy
[SPEAKER_02]: might have a cool little soil recipe that
you, you know, you add it to yours or he
[SPEAKER_02]: might have a different way of growing or
breeding or you never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just take all these little good
tidbits, you put them together and wham,
[SPEAKER_02]: bam, you know, you start coming up with
some real winning recipes, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, it sounds like you're in a pretty
fortunate position to be able to chat to
[SPEAKER_03]: all of these awesome breeders at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where did the original Brothers Grimm fit
into things for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Were they kind of hitting their peak
popularity when you were getting into
[SPEAKER_03]: growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, where did you see them in their
initial incarnation?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really weird because like when I,
when I made my first order, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: in 2000, like they were known,
but not like, you know, super hugely well
[SPEAKER_02]: known.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't really think people realize
what they had or how good it was until
[SPEAKER_02]: after it was gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, people would overlook things
back in those days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, because you had your old
standby.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exactly like today, but we all almost
have like the opposite problem because
[SPEAKER_02]: like, there's like a million of these guys
that are like, oh yeah, we're breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, bro, because you put fucking
pollen on a, on a marijuana flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't make you a fucking breeder,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're a seed maker, a glorified seed
maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, you got all this garbage out there
to try to root through, but back then,
[SPEAKER_02]: there weren't that many people doing it,
but people were very afraid to change,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like for, for good reason too,
because there was a lot of just chicken
[SPEAKER_02]: shit genetics then too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I saw the pictures, um, and like
soul's descriptions of the shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: like peak my interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm like, yeah, I want to walk
on the fucking man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to, you know, smoke some weed and
make me trip the fuck out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, like I was like,
well, that sounds real good and a quick
[SPEAKER_02]: flower time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, all right, I'm going to take
my money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get a money order and we'll
send it on up to Canada, the heaven
[SPEAKER_02]: stairway.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to get a pack of this shit
and see what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was so good that it's 2016 or a DEA
raid later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still got that same clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had I lost that, I would be so butthurt
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be really mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I lost that man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, yeah, I mean, you know,
they, they were, they were getting an end
[SPEAKER_02]: back then, but they just didn't have the,
uh, the recognition yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was definitely afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's disbanded and long gone before
people were like, wow, that was the shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how did you initially get in touch with
Mr. Soul and kind of broach the idea of
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing brothers Grimm back or did he
come to you with the idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, sub cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, hit me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What the fuck was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, like a summer summer,
like this time this year, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was probably, yeah, around June of
last year and said, Hey, man, fucking Mr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul just gotten told to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, looking, looking to get
back in the industry, get a job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, okay, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, do you, you know,
you know any place he could, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: come out and do shit?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, well, you know, I'm here in
Colorado and you know, there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's jobs to be had out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ended up, uh, he gives me a call.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, yeah, man, I'm ready to,
ready to rock and roll, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll set you up with this little job
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can work with me and we got to,
you know, working around each other and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're like, yeah, man, you know,
start making some seeds and we got the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems like the right, the right mix,
the right match.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just said, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them what they want, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit they've been missing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you guys first started our
brainstorming, what were some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: initial ideas you had for Brothers Grimm?
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it initially, let's just re-release
some of the classics and go from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or did you kind of have some clear goals
as to what you wanted to do in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we, uh, we definitely knew that,
uh, right off the bat, you gotta have the
[SPEAKER_02]: classics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, stuff that like we were saying,
people didn't realize what they had or
[SPEAKER_02]: what was out there until it was already
gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, having Cinderella,
um, having the Apollos, the Rosetta,
[SPEAKER_02]: all these old classics, you know,
that was a definite, you gotta have it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you gotta have it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we did realize like, Hey,
you know, we do have all this original
[SPEAKER_02]: stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only so much work to get these done
and back out there, but we already know
[SPEAKER_02]: that the work from back in the nineties
into the two thousands, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just crushes everything that's around
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I can't believe these jokers have
been working fucking 15 years and got this
[SPEAKER_02]: chicken shit, but so yeah, I'm going to
try to be nice, man, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: for real.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we know that like that's already
going to be good, but we looked at it
[SPEAKER_02]: like, okay, well, where did we want to go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what, what else did we want to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're picking up on some of his old
stuff and, you know, I had a lot of my own
[SPEAKER_02]: things that I was looking to do and things
that I did way back that were like great
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, but I didn't sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd sell some to like an outdoor
farmer, you know, in the Northeast or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just helping friends out or
growing them myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's stuff that I know that the
general public, you know, they didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really dig it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were looking along the lines of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you kind of look at like,
what's the world missing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, there's not really any
really serious good haze hybrids,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the JJ kicks ass with the chem
dog, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, there's, you know,
a lot more work that can be done with the
[SPEAKER_02]: chem dog and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, of course there's like a million
people out there like, yeah, sour diesel
[SPEAKER_02]: and seed form and it ain't sour and it
ain't diesel, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I thought that was a good
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The skunk, you know, that kind of went out
back in the 90s, people talk about,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh yeah, roadkill skunk's real awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that was something,
you know, you had to resurrect that good
[SPEAKER_02]: haze hybrids, good sativas, basically all
the things that people want, but it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really not out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, like a lot of the Indica
stuff too, it was, you know, real big.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are getting Indica stuff
and they're like, oh yeah, it's Indica,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's really, it's like, it's more than
a poly hybrid and it's not really Indica
[SPEAKER_02]: either, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really that good narcotic drug
traits that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the stuff that just makes you
melt in the couch like, oh, I can't move,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get pizza, but I can't move.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you need these things back
in your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and we got our old genetic collection
back, it goes as far back as 1978,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of these clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're able to really kick it
off and get things rolling proper again.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way they should be, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I've got a bit of a longer question
here, but it does tie into those Indicas.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, not too long ago, I was watching when
Mr. Soul was on the Adam Dunn show and he
[SPEAKER_03]: was speaking about his former partner,
Sly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it made me realize that you and him
have a lot in common in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I hope I don't paraphrase
Mr. Soul wrong here, but he essentially
[SPEAKER_03]: said, you know, not only did he help him
with the breeding, but he helped him to
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of round out the offering in terms of
bringing some other strains to the table.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it certainly appears like you seem to
do that in terms of the Grimdica and the
[SPEAKER_03]: Hashmaster in the new release.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, how do you feel about this comparison
to Sly?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you, are these new Indica strains
kind of more your children?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely, I really, really like my
Indicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sly did a great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like one of my favorite ones was called
Sugar Blossoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was one that really didn't make
it out a lot, but man, it was really
[SPEAKER_02]: killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, like on the same token, like I loved,
like the Cindy, I loved the Apollo,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like Green Giant was a great one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Sugar Blossoms was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Grim Widow was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Sly, he was a kick-ass dude himself,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say you'd agree, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got lucky both times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got lucky twice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, when we look at the new Brothers
Grim offering just recently put out,
[SPEAKER_03]: we noticed that some of the strains have
been slightly altered in their genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: composition for re-release, such as the
Rosetta Stone, which now has a pure
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack-Hera mother, as well as the Apollo
11, which is now sort of a back cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did you guys decide to do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do you think it'll affect them
compared to, say, the former editions?
[SPEAKER_02]: I had planned to call it back even before
I broke down the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he was saying he was planning to
call her out before it even stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say, yeah, it was like one of
them things some people like, some people
[SPEAKER_02]: don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the girl herself would have been,
out of those three seeds, the most
[SPEAKER_02]: jack-leaning of the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me, personally, I'd say like the genius is
the most of the haze dominant of the
[SPEAKER_02]: group.
[SPEAKER_02]: The princess, to me, is more of the NL5
dominant out of the group.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you want to do like the Rosetta
Stone, the Jack-Hera is just mind-blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that we use, it's the same one
that Sensei would have used.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack-Hera even selected the clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's his personal cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, very, very, very stinky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got that super lemon, pine,
haze, funk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sandalwood and all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make a mince cologne.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's going to make a mince cologne.
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably attract other men, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the name, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, we're shutting down the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going into the colognes and
fragrances.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the structure of it, that sativa haze
dominance out of it, made a better parent
[SPEAKER_02]: than the Cafe Girl whatever made and would
have given you a better, improved version
[SPEAKER_02]: of Rosetta Stone and kind of what it was
intended to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very nice, hazy, put your mind in
the clouds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a lot of Jack influence,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the A11 is actually going to be just
A11.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't be a back cross or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had to go grow out a literal shit
ton of Cinderella 99 and find the right
[SPEAKER_02]: nail to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've grown out more than what I'm
even comfortable saying right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that boy, he's lined up right in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make like a nice little
batch of nothing but A11 in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have that Cindy hitting the
genius and making A11 from scratch.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Apollo 13 is the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just made from scratch the same way
as it always was.
[SPEAKER_02]: P75, the genius, and you got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything's made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Made the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that Rosetta Stone, that would be the
one that is different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, we could totally argue it's a
bit improved even maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say I'm sure the Rosetta
Stone's improved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Matter of fact, I'll take you all on a
little tour since we're talking about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll show you a couple of the different
phenotypes of the old Rosetta.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just got to walk upstairs, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a big-ass Cindy mom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're talking about Cindy,
I've got a quick question on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, Cindy is actually a BX3.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another word for the Princess BX3.
[SPEAKER_03]: In your ideal world, would you want all
brothers Grimm strains to be kind of true
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding in at that back cross level?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think F1s have a good place in
the breeding world?
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the Cindy 99, that's four back
crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes it very stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good breeding stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain things I would say, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's to me, filial breeding and back
crossing, they're two different tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: So certain tools work better for certain
jobs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could say like with Apollo 13 and
Apollo 11, they're way, way better as an
[SPEAKER_02]: F1, just that original F1 hybrid than they
are as a back cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or F3, F4, you start to lose things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So certain strains, you start to lose
things in translation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain things you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can back cross them, filial mount,
and improve them even.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make them more potent or better,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But certain things, they just don't like
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can lock down smell, flavor,
structure, all this, but sometimes you
[SPEAKER_02]: start to lose that potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of that I attribute to the,
just that hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having two unrelated things or even two
slightly related things go together and
[SPEAKER_02]: you create a monster, but you take it
beyond that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be able to keep a lot of it,
but some of it, it's not gonna be as good
[SPEAKER_02]: as that F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with us, we're like, it's gotta be,
meet the parent or beat the parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't accept mediocrity, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it ain't as good or better,
it goes right down the shutter,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ain't having them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want great, not good, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure if you've noticed,
but there seems to be like a current trend
[SPEAKER_03]: among some breeders to just want to take
everything to the F2 or the F3.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that this is a bit of the
wrong kind of approach or do you think
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe they'd be better off maybe
back-crossing things or just keeping them
[SPEAKER_03]: as F1s?
[SPEAKER_02]: Certain things they could.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when somebody makes an F2, a lot of
people, they don't have the concept of
[SPEAKER_02]: what's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think, oh, wow, you know,
they took it to F2.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be stable, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not the case, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you breed stuff to F2, if like I
take, let's say I take like an Indica plan
[SPEAKER_02]: and a pure sativa plant and I make an F1
and we're seeing like five phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, one should be more like the mom,
three should be like a blend of the two,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then one should be more like the
daddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we take it to an F2 and I think the
ratio is like, what the fuck is it,
[SPEAKER_02]: man?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like nine, three, three, five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what happens is now you've
got every color of the rainbow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, it is all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see stuff not only from the mom,
but shit from her mom and her dad and all
[SPEAKER_02]: these recessive things popping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, before you stabilize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, you know, you're just gonna
end up with this big nasty spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it can be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if me and you are looking for a very,
very special something to use,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, yeah, I mean, it could be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for people that are like, oh,
well, take like Girl Scout cookies,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you take that garbage, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already a poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if you do make an F1 with something,
it's still a poly hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now if you take that, you make an F2
and you got shit all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody is going to say, hey,
man, is that F2 Girl Scout cookies?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to show you this picture
of a form cut Girl Scout cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, you'll be hard pressed to find that
sucker in them F2s.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna see stuff all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it has its place,
but normally an F2 is like something in a,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, good solid breeding program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're looking to really refine
something during that F2 search.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if I didn't find what I wanted to use
as like, say, like a back cross to
[SPEAKER_02]: something in the mom, I didn't really see
exactly what I was looking for in my F1
[SPEAKER_02]: population.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might take it to an F2 to get that big
diversity to find that rare thing that I
[SPEAKER_02]: am looking forward to where I have more of
these gene pairs in one male per se to
[SPEAKER_02]: take that and then take it back to the
mom, then use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now taking things to F3 and F4,
like I said, you do stabilize them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, some strains like it,
some strains don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them are going to say,
yeah, we're going to be structurally
[SPEAKER_02]: great, but the potency is going to go
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smell is going to water down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a trial and error,
I guess, from strain to strain to what,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what you're going to be able to
accomplish.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that cubing, like if you're
looking for one specific phenotype,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're looking to lock down all the
true traits of that specific phenotype,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're really hard pressed to beat the
cubing method.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just touching back on the girl scout
cookies, what's your general feelings
[SPEAKER_03]: about kind of these more fad strains,
you know, your gorilla glues, your girl
[SPEAKER_03]: scout cookies, and, you know, back in the
day, the blue dreams, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: do you think these strains have a place in
the breeding world or would you just never
[SPEAKER_03]: consider working with them?
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wouldn't work with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you did want to put it into a seed
form, I mean, you could go along the,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, that's nice, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: You could go along and say, yeah,
man, you know, we'll cube out the girl
[SPEAKER_02]: scout cookie clone and we'll make it into
a seed form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it could be done, but I'm not trying
to work on something that I don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: really like, you know, the thing about
girl scouts, it looks like super crazy
[SPEAKER_02]: resonance, and it looks like it would hurt
you, man, but it don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I barely catch a buzz on the stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes real good, but hell,
man, I know a bunch of shit that tastes
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I go eat some girl scout cookies
that I want to taste the shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but you know, that's,
I guess it's subjective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So getting back onto more, your kind of
strains, we've had some talk about the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the Durban tie, Cindy 99 possibly being
re-released.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything you might be able to
share with us about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're actually working on it right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that Durban that you actually saw.
[SPEAKER_02]: So since the Tiva seed club, they're the
ones that made the, the Durban tie high
[SPEAKER_02]: flyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't, we don't have it anymore,
sadly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sue for killer strands.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the best things I ever smoked in my
wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just ridiculously potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, make you scared, you know,
you really get freaked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what we got to do,
we had the best outstanding Durban I've
[SPEAKER_02]: ever, ever had ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen anything come close to
this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a really nice tie and now we
have our Cindy male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what we got to do,
we got to make it, make it from scratch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are, we are currently working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the first F1 out cross basically step
one of it's actually getting ready to go
[SPEAKER_02]: down and like, like 10 days, 14 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be something you'll see it by
next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we'll have to make two different
sides of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll probably actually use one filial
cross to find what we're really looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll take that back probably to
the tie or depending on how the offspring
[SPEAKER_02]: turn out, what we're looking to walk down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, DTC 99 will definitely be back
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's just killer man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we expect to see any others from the
former menu released?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think that might be the last of
the first edition?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're looking at the, we're looking
at the, the green giant, the grim widow
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tyson D 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those would be the first things that we
really get to get to work and on other
[SPEAKER_02]: things that probably see like something
like the sugar blossoms again,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the white widow hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm really looking to do is so it's
kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the Kim dog D, the smell,
the structure, and a lot of things about
[SPEAKER_02]: that remind me of a lot of the princess
and the genius actually reminds me a bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of the 91 in certain ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But kind of like on opposite ends of the
spectrum where the Kim dog is very much
[SPEAKER_02]: just crushes you man for the genius is so
like uplifting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm actually looking to experiment a
lot with the combinations of those two,
[SPEAKER_02]: two different gene pools and nobody else
is really, really messing around with it
[SPEAKER_02]: yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'd be pretty, pretty cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, keeping with the kind of topic of
breeding, what would be kind of your
[SPEAKER_03]: number one advice for a freshly starting
out breeder in terms of what, what are
[SPEAKER_03]: they best, uh, in terms of what,
what's the energy best spent doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Should you be trying to grow out the
largest numbers of one strain you can and
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to get, you know, your selection
right, or maybe a few different strains
[SPEAKER_03]: and trying to find some unique things to
cross together?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be your advice?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say don't start breeding stuff
unless you're super, super, passionate
[SPEAKER_02]: about the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if it's just like, eh, you know,
that way it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want something that's really got your
attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, wow, that's the best we have ever
had in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It works for me better than anything I've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I want, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you have that type of feel
to like, that's what you, what you really
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's where it all kind of starts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you might say, well, I really
like it, but you know, the structure on it
[SPEAKER_02]: is God awful, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that might be your starting
point is like, Hey, I really love this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, but I want to improve something or
it might have everything you're looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for all in one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just might want to stabilize that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would say if you know what you're
looking for trait wise and stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you wouldn't necessarily have to grow out
huge populations, but the more you grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: the more opportunities you're going to see
to find things that, that, that would go
[SPEAKER_02]: along with this breeding program better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where you might nail down like two out
of the five traits, you're looking to
[SPEAKER_02]: nail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you grew out, say 50 of these
plants instead, you might find that male
[SPEAKER_02]: that you could lock down all these traits
with this one male, you know, or a good
[SPEAKER_02]: portion of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the more is definitely the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't necessarily have to,
but it's probably going to take you
[SPEAKER_02]: longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to get, to get where you're wanting to
go with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I would say definitely have a
vision in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's good to have a good diverse
palette as they would say, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, uh, if you wanted a good chef,
I mean, if the son of a bitch has only
[SPEAKER_02]: cooked barbecue his whole life and ate
barbecue his whole life, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can put him in a restaurant with like
50 things on the menu and probably ain't
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be too good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty good to get around,
try different things, grow different
[SPEAKER_02]: things, and you can start to see things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like even in a poly hybrid,
like Girl Scout cookies, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow that out, man, I don't see Girl
Scout cookies, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smelled Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: I taste Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting to taste a little bits of
Lebanese hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I can start to pick apart all
these different ingredients into the stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've grown all of them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've grown Northern Lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown the skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown the Colombian and the Northern
Lights haze and pure haze and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: anything you can think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done grown it already and grown it in
pretty good numbers to say, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's that fino.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that fino.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is showing me this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know this ain't going to breed worth
a damn because it won't breed true for it
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say, you know, definitely make
sure, you know, you get well versed
[SPEAKER_02]: growing different things, have a good goal
in mind of what you want to do and make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that it's something that you're
really, really loving.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like you're passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that's the best advice I
could give them and pay attention to
[SPEAKER_02]: detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like even the smallest things like the
serrations on a leaf and the petioles and
[SPEAKER_02]: the colors of the stem and the flowers and
the floral clusters and the length between
[SPEAKER_02]: nodes and how they get tighter and like
the ratio of how they get tighter and
[SPEAKER_02]: every little tiniest traits that you can
think of, even the lines and the leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all these things, they're all
bound to something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be something insignificant or it
could be something big like these
[SPEAKER_02]: serrations might be potency that's tied
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, it could be fiber production and
stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it could be something insignificant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like once the arrangement of these lines
on this leaf is associated with that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, serration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep all those in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you grow them out, you know,
see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you got notes saying, all right,
they're thin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got real jagged saw serrations and
they're tall and lanky.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might notice those are your most
potent ones and you might say the other
[SPEAKER_02]: ones aren't as potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if you're going to find your
male you might be looking for these female
[SPEAKER_02]: traits in a male plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be, okay, I'd make sure I get the
saw serrations, thin leaf, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: lankier male is probably going to end up
giving me what I want in my later
[SPEAKER_02]: generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So keeping on that theme of genetics,
how do you think epigenetics plays into
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've heard people talk about
this idea of seeds coming from really good
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, good plants that were taken care
of well, you know, they perform better.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, how do you feel about that idea?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had some buddies that made seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not even going to put them out there
like that, but they, man, they're
[SPEAKER_02]: terrible, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're terrible growers and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were making seeds on unhealthy
plants, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now if you take like human beings,
for instance, right, and you got a mom
[SPEAKER_02]: man, she smokes crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: She drinks 40s of malt liquor,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's fat and nasty and not healthy at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eats like shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that baby's probably going to be
premature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be all fucked up and nasty
and, you know, not what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you take like say like some chick
that's big into yoga and eating right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she takes prenatal vitamins and all
this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, when she gives birth to her baby,
it's probably going to be pretty healthy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it also plays a part in like,
was daddy a big Olympian muscle builder?
[SPEAKER_02]: And was she like an athletic type?
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that plays a part too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the health, the overall health of her
during that time of carrying this baby,
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely see it, you know,
with the plants too.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got a good healthy plant that is
of a good genetic background and you
[SPEAKER_02]: facilitate seed growth and like keeping
these plants as healthy as possible and
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding them as a seeded plant,
they eat a hell of a lot of food,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to feed them a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to facilitate seed growth by adding
boron.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any source of boron is super, super
crucial to good seed development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amino acids derived from organic soybean.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of a lot of extra little
perks that I give them that I don't say
[SPEAKER_02]: like a normal flowering plant,
you know, that's like sensei crop or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do notice that when I sprout my
seeds, I get a better germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tend to blow through the ground a lot
quicker and tend to see like a more
[SPEAKER_02]: vigorous plant, more resistant plant
against like disease and past and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they typically just overall vigor and
health, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I definitely believe that, yeah,
you want to take real good care of them
[SPEAKER_02]: when they're pregnant, man, or else
they'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've seemed to have gone through a few
generations of different lighting
[SPEAKER_03]: technology within, say, the past 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've gone from HIDs to LEDs and
now we've got these double-ended Gavita
[SPEAKER_03]: bulbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you guys moved to Gavita as your kind
of gold standard as a lot of the industry
[SPEAKER_03]: has?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think the technology is not
quite there yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, like I was talking about
earlier, I was on the old parabolic
[SPEAKER_02]: reflector, you know, and there was the HPS
air-cooled hoods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like if you've seen some of them
pictures I put up last night of them
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers, that's growing in a basement
under old ass HPS hoods, man, like
[SPEAKER_02]: garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't have thought so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so like if you're growing real good
and you give them what they need,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you can still get good quality and,
you know, get real good yields from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to tell you, these
double-ended lamps, dude, it ain't even
[SPEAKER_02]: fair, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was hitting like three a light on
HPS technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm using these things right now,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I don't blind you out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can see it well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those suckers, man, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it just makes it so much like the
plants just get bigger, buds bigger,
[SPEAKER_02]: more dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say, yeah, the double-ended
technology, I would say, is very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this, man, for y'all in
Australia, don't buy Gavita.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in this company called Monsanto,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monsanto is like the evil empire,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't support suckers at all,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking to take over the world and
like not in a good way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got Nanolux.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nanolux, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the company I've been using and I
really, really like their stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not like paid by them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ain't sponsored.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to buy them or nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, I'm just like you, you know,
I got money I try to make and yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna spend it well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the Nanolux, I don't see any
failures with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's another brand out there called
Papalon, E-Papalon and the Phantom DE.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I noticed here in this warehouse,
like when we had like blackouts or
[SPEAKER_02]: brownouts where the whiting kind of
flickers, man, their ballast would just
[SPEAKER_02]: fail, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with these Nanoluxes, man,
they don't skip a beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't break.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The design's very streamlined so you can
mount them better.
[SPEAKER_02]: The price on them, they're cheaper than
Gavita or any of the others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have a lot of really cool
technology and features using like
[SPEAKER_02]: wireless controllers where they give you
like a sunrise function where it might
[SPEAKER_02]: start off at 400 watts, you know,
and then after 30 minutes it goes to 500
[SPEAKER_02]: and it slowly creeps up over however long
you want to set it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can replicate a sunrise and a sunset.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has temperature sensing technology to
where it says, okay, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that this guy wants my temperature
to be, you know, no hotter than 85 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: at this canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it hits 86 or 87, the light says,
oh, hey, man, I'm getting too hot for this
[SPEAKER_02]: guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it goes from a thousand watts and it
might go down to 950 watts or 921 watts,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it needs to do to satisfy that
temperature set point, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're really smart and really nice
and hell, man, like I can even look at
[SPEAKER_02]: this shit on my phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty sweet, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry for interrupting before.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, yeah,
people in Australia are very aware of
[SPEAKER_03]: Monsanto and are definitely not fans of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thankfully we're up to date on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next kind of bunch of questions are
kind of not so breeding related,
[SPEAKER_03]: more kind of the scene related.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is kind of an issue which is
fairly big in Australia because we're just
[SPEAKER_03]: in the very early stages of setting up our
kind of medical model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my kind of first question would be how
well do you think the American medical
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis model is working for the
patients?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, do you think it's, it's been a
net positive or I hear claims about people
[SPEAKER_03]: saying things are going backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what's your ideas on all of
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here, uh, here recently,
man, I don't even know if I should say it
[SPEAKER_02]: or not, but like I just, I just went legit
like a month ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I never took the medical thing very
lightly.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a lot of people that were like,
well, you can grow, just go up the street
[SPEAKER_02]: and get this medical card.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that was kind of a lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not going to pretend to grow for
a sick person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're not really sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they got an achy back the same way
as I got an achy back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're all sick in that regard,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they, so there was that, that whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there are sick people who are
genuinely really ill that can use this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were the people that I wanted to
take care of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I never in my life had really run into
these really, really chronically ill
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, mainly because like, I don't,
I don't really get out much, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm constantly growing and the way it was
in the old days, you don't talk to people,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you kept it quiet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I came in contact with some people here
and like, they were real sick kids,
[SPEAKER_02]: some sick adults that had a multiple
sclerosis, cancer, Crohn's, all these
[SPEAKER_02]: horrible, horrible things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just started giving them weed like,
yeah, man, here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're like, oh man, it's so
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, why don't you,
be our caregiver?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to be your caregiver,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could, you know, help you out,
then that makes my day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm actually doing my job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way it went here was there was no
like real legal recreational thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody was like, oh, medical,
medical, medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these real actual sick people,
you know, they were, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of had people giving them weed or
selling them weed or they had a dispenser.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now in the States where it went
recreational, man, a lot of these people,
[SPEAKER_02]: they got thrown to the wayside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to mess with them no more
because they went and they got that rec
[SPEAKER_02]: license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're just, you know,
kind of shit out of luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no one's, no one cares about the
medical patients anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sadly enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are places where they still do and
it's kind of hit and miss on an individual
[SPEAKER_02]: basis too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's set up pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it really just comes down to
the individual, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're good people, you know,
good things, you know, you can do good
[SPEAKER_02]: things for other good people, but just
know, like if y'all get medical going,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's going to be a lot of rat bastards
out there, but they're already there
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just, uh, I guess the best thing to say
is just do the right thing, do what's in
[SPEAKER_02]: your heart and try to take care of sick
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause there are a lot of sick people who
do need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can do a good job, you know,
grow some good, clean, organic,
[SPEAKER_02]: good quality medicine for them,
man, that's, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, good thing to do good karma on
you.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thankfully there are some people in
Australia who kind of are still after six
[SPEAKER_03]: sick people are regardless of the legal
status.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, uh, I guess in that kind of same
idea, um, for, for a country like
[SPEAKER_03]: Australia, that is just, you know,
about to say kind of legalized things in
[SPEAKER_03]: the foreseeable future.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think is maybe some of the
traps or pitfalls, you know, some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: ideas that were presented as a good idea
at first, which now in retrospect you
[SPEAKER_03]: realize were not good things for the
States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like a big crucial thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like a lot of people, they say,
Oh, wow, you're going to legalize weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to vote yes for it, but really
look at what that law says, because like
[SPEAKER_02]: right now in California, they're trying to
legalize it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But legalization with the California
market, with the bill that they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, trying to push through basically
makes it worse really than it ever did,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, before it was legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like now it's like, if that were to
pass and you get caught with an ounce of
[SPEAKER_02]: weed, Hey, you're a fella now,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they're going to send your ass to
prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so basically it's set up for like big
corporations to control everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like they'll make it to where you're
not allowed to grow your own for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not allowed to grow anything for a
sick person.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got to go to their local Monsanto
growery and buy their cheap dog shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: Eagle 20 written spider mite infested
crap, you know, so whatever they do put in
[SPEAKER_02]: front of you, just make sure you y'all
read it real good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they, you know, governments are
sneaky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about Australia, but I know
in America, you got to watch them suckers,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll fuck you any chance they get,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one of the, uh, the major arguments
or kind of ideas put forward is that,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, legalization will be somewhat similar
to tobacco in Australia in that there
[SPEAKER_03]: would be a few large companies running it
all and very likely the potential of
[SPEAKER_03]: people not being able to grow their own
medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about that idea?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's kind of intrinsically
important for people to be able to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: their own medicines?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think, uh, you know,
a big Monsanto type company is adequately
[SPEAKER_03]: able to provide for people?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I worked in Virginia doing like
engineering and instrumentation and all
[SPEAKER_02]: that good stuff, I used to work for a
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all got Marlboro cigarettes over there,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can get them here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I used to work for those people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're called Philip Morris, but,
um, so with the tobacco industry or any
[SPEAKER_02]: industry for that matter, they're high
volume, low quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly doubt you would get anything
beneficial from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, here in the old days, we used to have
basically, we call it a swag market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was illegal weed grown in
Mexico, mostly come in a brick,
[SPEAKER_02]: real cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pesticide ridden, not very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, to me, those types of places will fill
that swag void if they do produce anything
[SPEAKER_02]: at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what you can do for yourself at your
own home is far superior than anything
[SPEAKER_02]: that you'll be able to buy in a store.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even in this market, like I'm in
Colorado right now, if I go to the store
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for weed, man, I'm pissed,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it is awful looking, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like what I can just do in my basement
will kill anything you'll find in a store
[SPEAKER_02]: around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not going to put the same
amount of love into it as you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're not going to know, like,
what did they spray that shit with?
[SPEAKER_02]: And did they pull it too early?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they pull it too late?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they even grow what the hell you need?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like for you, for your ailments,
you know, so if you got Crohn's or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, and all they got is Girl Scout
cookies, you shit out of luck,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you need something, you know,
more specific for what you're looking to
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say being able to grow,
grow your own is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and my thought has always been
until they consider cannabis the same as a
[SPEAKER_02]: tomato plant, no regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a plant as any other plant until that
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still like, fuck them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't like being regulated at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fuck these assholes, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, you know, plants a plant and
especially wants medicinal and good for
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shame on them for even trying to regulate
it, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So obviously you're an organic fanatic
like myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your opinion on organics versus
synthetics in terms of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: do you think synthetics just reduce the
flavor and the terpenes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think it actually reduces the
medicinal value compared to organics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's a good question, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've seen a lot of hydro weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people can do it good and do it
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I grew hydroponics myself,
even, you know, way back in the day when
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a cash crop thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can grow a good product
hydroponically, but I can grow a better
[SPEAKER_02]: product organically, I guess you could
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still would have medicinal benefit,
but you would get more medicinal benefit,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, of course from a better product
and that being organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that growing organically,
it was less maintenance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually less work.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants actually grow better and
bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: That used to be the argument of a hydro
guys that, well, you know, you might have
[SPEAKER_02]: a better taste or smell or whatever,
but hey, I yield more, but not the way I
[SPEAKER_02]: grow organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't, you know, you might meet it
maybe, you know, but I'll take the Pepsi
[SPEAKER_02]: challenge on that shit too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, honestly it's cheaper,
it's easier, you know, it's better for
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to worry about flushing
fucking plants for 14 days to get shit
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, I'm not gonna put nothing
in it, but you know, I don't want,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of nasty weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one buddy that grows hydro and he's
probably like the only person I know of
[SPEAKER_02]: that actually does a good job that I would
actually smoke, but if he were to grow in
[SPEAKER_02]: organics, shit man, it'd be that much
better, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: He only puts it out of necessity though,
like it's the only way he can grow in his
[SPEAKER_02]: current situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm not sure if the idea is as
prevalent in America as it is in
[SPEAKER_03]: Australia, but currently there's this big
trend to kind of push CBD as the medical
[SPEAKER_03]: component of weed and to push THC as the
recreational component.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think it's a bit of a
misrepresentation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, if you look at the research,
so CBD, you know, prevents like the
[SPEAKER_02]: metastasizing of cancer cells,
whereas THC actually kills the cancer
[SPEAKER_02]: cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually see them both, like you
don't want this one, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: one or the other, you would actually,
you want both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's like the medicinal
benefit of like terpenes, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it comes off of a CBD plant or THC
plant, like mercine and all that good
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, like they all have their own
medicinal benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, having one without the
other, as far as the medicine goes,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're kind of pissing in the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you definitely got to have
both, you know, not just for cancer,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for anything, anything really pain,
nerve damage stuff, gastrointestinal
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, depression, you know, there's so
many different benefits for the stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not as simple as just THC hits
you high and CBD heals you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in recreational need, if you want to
now call it that, the different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid profiles change the different
kind of high.
[SPEAKER_01]: The perceived high can be greater from a
plant that has lower overall THC than
[SPEAKER_01]: another, but its profile is more...
[SPEAKER_02]: More CBG and CBN, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whatever it is, we don't know what that
code is yet, but there is definitely an
[SPEAKER_01]: interplay of the different cannabinoids
that add up to something that's greater
[SPEAKER_01]: than the sum of the parts, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't understand how it all works
yet, but it's certainly not as simple as
[SPEAKER_01]: just pure THC, just extract that and leave
everything behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to be the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neither is getting just pure CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause like you can smoke, say like a Thai
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: 12% THC, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can go get an Afghani plant,
12% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked that Thai and I'm like,
oh geez, that's strong, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna gotta go hide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I could smoke that 12% endocode and
just be like nodding out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: THC is THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the whole profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the THC in combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other cannabinoids, the propyl
cannabinoids, your THCV and all that good
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: In combination with the terpenes,
that's what makes a Thai a Thai and a
[SPEAKER_02]: Ghani a Ghani, and an Endica and a
Sativa's differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the different medicinal benefits of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you take somebody with ADHD bouncing
off the walls, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could give them a nice strong Sativa and
probably chill their ass out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas I give it to this other dude or
myself, and I'm like, oh Jesus,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's too much, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So touching on that synergy that kind of
you and Mr. Soul just mentioned,
[SPEAKER_03]: we often hear people talk about how they
will say, you know, kind of like your
[SPEAKER_03]: example with that Thai or a haze,
for example, you know, these strains would
[SPEAKER_03]: never test as high as what strains do
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, people would often claim there's
no ceiling to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you think that gets lost?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, do you think that's just our
over time, over hybridizing strains you
[SPEAKER_03]: lose that or you gain a ceiling in the
high?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of people will claim that,
you know, new strains have a ceiling,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, whereas some of the older ones
don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was why they were so memorable.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, there is that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's certain ones that,
yeah, the land race, there's something
[SPEAKER_02]: pure in those chemo types that really
doesn't have that ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at a lot of the old
hybrids, like say like the Durban Thai
[SPEAKER_02]: high flyer, that had no ceiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could get so high you turn white
faced and sweaty and puke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they were they were they were based
off of land races, you know, Durban,
[SPEAKER_02]: Pinetown, Durban, Sativa and pure Thai.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't water it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had two land races and they
stabilized them well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They paid attention to their breeding
program and they didn't accept mediocrity,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They they made sure it was strong as shit
every time they did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so you can lose some doing some
bad breeding practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing, the the testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you guys over there, you all see
Girl Scout cookies or whatever tests,
[SPEAKER_02]: 35 percent THC, 40 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell you, that's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy that got that tested probably
knows the guy at the lab or the lab says,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, if we keep turning out these big
numbers, some of these guys, they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep coming to us to get the testing
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the guy at the corner is giving you
a real test on it and he's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, you're like 18 percent THC,
which is a fucking lot, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got down the street gives you 32.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now in the market, say like in Oregon,
for instance, that's probably like the
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest place I see this problem is that
there's guys there like going to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Spencer with weed that says, yeah,
this test at 42 percent THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bullshit, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now the guy at that lab is making a
killing because everybody wants to go get
[SPEAKER_02]: tested with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get these good numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now at the dispensaries, the whole market
is driven by THC percentages.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you got like an uneducated public.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think THC is the only thing getting
you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like we got Apollo 13 at Apollo 13,
like on a real actual legit test.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like I think it was like 16 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: My God, that's 16 percent gets me higher
than any so-called 30 percent gorilla glue
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's quite a bit of
bullshit part of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, I mean, on a legit test like
my buddy gets his stuff like legitimately
[SPEAKER_02]: tested the same bud that we could take up
and get 35 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really only about 22 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's it's a few different,
few different factors involved in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because something's resinous doesn't
mean that it's very high in THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you've seen those pictures of that 88
G 13 hash plant, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've seen how frosty that is,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Covered in snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think a test at THC?
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had to guess those wild figures,
probably 29 or something, 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I used to think, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like 19 percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I've seen pictures of peyote purple,
which is a notoriously low THC
[SPEAKER_03]: percentages, but very frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, very frosty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's all these other things on it
like, you know, that 88.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even like smoking that shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too damn strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I mean, it just I mean, it's like a
time and place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like doing acid or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you know, there's the right
place, the right time around the right
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just makes me eat, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I can't keep fridge with groceries in
it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be eating pizzas and pudding,
man, and chips and dip, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ain't no good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good for some had stomach
problems, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you think we'll ever get to the
point, even with accurate testing and new
[SPEAKER_03]: technology, where we can ever
quantitatively put the medical value of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis on a plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think we're never going to be
able to put a number on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's always going to be a
synergy and you're just going to have to
[SPEAKER_03]: try it, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think part of it, part of it,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like what gets me just completely
blustered, man, like it is just like the
[SPEAKER_02]: best thing since sliced bread for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could give it to Mr. Soul and he would
agree like, oh, yes, it's very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But something else works for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think a lot of it has to do with just
the uniqueness of like how our brains are
[SPEAKER_02]: wired.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're all individuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think part of it's going to do with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that, you know,
across like a large enough baseline,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can say like 88 G 13 hash plant makes me
starve and hungry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody asks most people out there,
you know, ask me, are you really going to
eat this?
And they say, Oh, yeah, they definitely
don't want to eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, they don't want to cook it
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just want to eat and eat and eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So certain things like that are,
you know, they ring true across the board.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we're starting to kind of like
document these things and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: keep our records, because like in the old
days, you couldn't keep records,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lady that was getting me all hooked up
with all these people that I'm growing for
[SPEAKER_02]: that are real real sick She's got a person
that works with the University of Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's very very interested,
you know, he's Master degree PhD doctor
[SPEAKER_02]: guy, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's very interested in like recording all
this data that we're coming up with of
[SPEAKER_02]: what works for what and So it turns out
like I knew all these people were very
[SPEAKER_02]: sick, but It turns out that their
illnesses are kind of like rare Illnesses,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so it's kind of cool to see
What's working for for for these certain
[SPEAKER_02]: things and then you got more common things
like cancer research and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: neuropathy, you know You know,
you got in a bad bike accident,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know Vendings are all screwed up and
what works for that versus the next thing
[SPEAKER_02]: and I really do believe that at the end of
the day it's going to come down to The the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes the individual terpenes and how
they help affect it because like a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people think oh, yeah We're just gonna
cook, you know, we're gonna cook this shit
[SPEAKER_02]: in the butter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're good Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna
take him next door and show him the
[SPEAKER_02]: motherfucking monsters you out of here
Yeah, yes You thinking Wendy's?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I think it's gonna come down to
these terpenes and like people say oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, you know I'm gonna cook some
cannabis butter and that's like a cure-all
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know I'm gonna give it to this guy
and we give it to that guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, man when you cook it You got high
temperatures man, you go you go cook all
[SPEAKER_02]: them terpenes off So by the time we're
said and done we've converted Delta 9 THC
[SPEAKER_02]: to Delta 11 THC's and we got a whole shit
ton of CBN now, you know degraded THC and
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of kind of just function kind of
the same whether it's Thai or whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: an indica or whatever So I think a lot of
it really does boil down to you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the smells that we're smelling You know
and how these things help like they just
[SPEAKER_02]: found out like the mercy and terpene do
you find out a lot?
[SPEAKER_02]: In like your purple strains your indicas,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They work on the same receptors as opiates
do so like I had buddies back home,
[SPEAKER_02]: man They were all hooked on heroin and
everything right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch the dope fiends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could give them good Indica's man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get them off that dope wanted help with
their stomach So they ain't throwing up so
[SPEAKER_02]: damn much and two it's acting on that same
receptor is that dope was so they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: jonesing for the dope So now they're
smoking good indica and then they able to
[SPEAKER_02]: kick that heroin, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like it's all time Yeah, that's
interesting I've heard of people being
[SPEAKER_03]: able to quit heroin with weed But then you
hear about other people who say it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: so effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe it's just a case of some are
getting the right strain for the situation
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly Okay, so um, just kind of want a
bit of a different note if someone kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: asked me to summarize You know the kind of
the current scene I would say that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: almost having a bit of a renaissance of
the past You know, if you look at people
[SPEAKER_03]: like Frenchy Knoll Lee bringing back kind
of the old hashish forms and then
[SPEAKER_03]: furthermore Like we could definitively
argue that there's an organic renaissance
[SPEAKER_03]: going on people are really getting back
into it Do you do you kind of agree with
[SPEAKER_03]: these trends that we need to go back to
the old?
[SPEAKER_03]: Practices kind of back to basics and look
to master the methodology as opposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: develop new technology Yeah, so So I used
to make hash all back in like 98 99 Made
[SPEAKER_02]: it up to like 2003.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we used to call it bh o butane honey
wall aka hippie crack so I'd make the shit
[SPEAKER_02]: out of it man Now I knew damn well that
stuff won't be so good for you man And
[SPEAKER_02]: when I'd smoke it, I mean it gets you gets
you good and good good and big But it
[SPEAKER_02]: won't know where near as good as some good
dry sieve or a bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was made properly So I think it's it's
gonna come down to a good blend because
[SPEAKER_02]: like there are some pretty cool technology
out there now But if we could kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: integrate some of those old ways Into a
little bit of our new technology like take
[SPEAKER_02]: like the rosin guys for instance,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making the rosin now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that's a pretty good little
alternative right there You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have any solvents.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing to purge out tastes good
smells good gets you baked So I think yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: if people were to Start becoming a little
more in tune with like what what we used
[SPEAKER_02]: to do back in the day before there was you
know Dab rigs and all this shit,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know You could sit down in your house
with the bubble bags and make all the hash
[SPEAKER_02]: you wanted and you didn't have to worry
about blowing your house up You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you didn't have to worry about some cancer
cause and damn hydrocarbons up in your
[SPEAKER_02]: shit You know and it tasted great,
you know, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you wanted to do So like me
personally man, like I don't I don't Smoke
[SPEAKER_02]: no passion or man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm probably in like the dab capital of
the world right now dudes around here
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking looking like crack heads with
torches and shit So I don't touch it man,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I will make my own bubble hash I will
make my own dry sieve.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got no problems with that but I do only
It's kind of like a rare occasion,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like if you're into drinking
right, you know, people drink beers
[SPEAKER_02]: casually You know you and me after work
whatever but hey on the weekend time to
[SPEAKER_02]: start Doing shots of bourbon or whatever
So I kind of think of it as the same way
[SPEAKER_02]: or if like I'm really hurting me and my
back is tweaked or whatever I can say hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, I'm gonna load up some bong hits or
whatever of You know this dress of and
[SPEAKER_02]: really kick my ass and feel feel like a
human again Yeah, so it's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting you say that because in
Australia the concentrate kind of game is
[SPEAKER_03]: just taking off and people are really
jumping all over the bhO would your kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of Advice be stick to the more solvent
this types of concentrates if possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Would like I do know some guys that are
very good and making bhO But they also
[SPEAKER_02]: have a laboratory and they have very
expensive equipment Yeah, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: it ain't like blowing through like old
stainless turkey basters and some power
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I would say you got to kind of
know Where your stuff's coming from
[SPEAKER_02]: because if you're talking to like Joe
around the corner He might not be purging
[SPEAKER_02]: it too good man, and that ain't good for
your lungs But you might know a guy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know a couple miles down the road that
does do a good job And you you can enjoy
[SPEAKER_02]: it, but I would say try some dress of You
probably won't see a lot of it in your
[SPEAKER_02]: area like it's never been a big thing even
here in America, right like they You don't
[SPEAKER_02]: really go to the store and see hey,
there's some solventless tricep because
[SPEAKER_02]: that bhO It's easier to make but what you
can do is you can get your grow on grow
[SPEAKER_02]: your own and then you know get you some
dry sieve and screens and just make your
[SPEAKER_02]: own and Like I mean, it's cool little dab
rigs and all that's too much work for me
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are cool and if you got one you
like to do it You can do it with the dress
[SPEAKER_02]: of all you got to do man once you got them
heads good and clean and it's Nothing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but trike heads you take that you apply a
little heat and some parchment paper and
[SPEAKER_02]: you pull it off man It looks just like
shatter and you can dab it and it tastes
[SPEAKER_02]: better and that gets you way way way more
fucked up, man You don't lose any
[SPEAKER_02]: terrapins doing dress of you know,
you don't lose the thing and it's pure
[SPEAKER_02]: It's clean and it's good for you,
too, man Yeah, awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I've never been able to try
any dry sieve, but it's on my bucket list
[SPEAKER_03]: So people often talk about this idea of
returning to land race routes,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Do you think this is the case and
it will get done?
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like it's been this idea that's
been floating around forever But no one
[SPEAKER_03]: ever really seems to do it or at least it
never seems to take hold within the
[SPEAKER_03]: community You know, do you think we'll
just continue hybridizing endlessly?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh You got so you look at the mass public,
you know guys that are trying to make
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds and This and that but the thing with
them is most of those guys are chasing a
[SPEAKER_02]: buck.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ain't chasing a passion So there are
some guys over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very passionate A couple friends
of mine in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even sell the seeds They could
they could sell them and probably make a
[SPEAKER_02]: fortune.
[SPEAKER_02]: But their main thing is preservation You
know everything from old Colombians and
[SPEAKER_02]: Mexican Oh Hawkins Thai and Cambodian
anything everything you can think of and
[SPEAKER_02]: they want to make sure that it remains
pure and they remain safe in a good seed
[SPEAKER_02]: form and maybe eventually they will sell
them but they're more into like You know
[SPEAKER_02]: giving them to a guy like me and say hey
you want to use it a hybrid or Whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm like, oh, yeah, you damn right
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can say that when you do Like all
these guys with the poly hybrids and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could take something from them introduce
a landing Race to it and make it pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: damn potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is something to be said for it
reintroducing a land race back into a
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrid that really Does does does the
trick like that Grimtica?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a Afghani land race right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been reintroduced to what you know
was a work hash plant, which is like three
[SPEAKER_02]: different really really nice Afghani From
different regions of Afghanistan that they
[SPEAKER_02]: bred together in a breeding program At
Sensei to make the old hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just reintroducing land race vigor
back into it and You know, you can you can
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely Do some damage man Yeah,
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so do you think we'll ever see you
know, the the new skunk number one type
[SPEAKER_03]: thing or you know The new northern lights
five or do you think we may be a bit past
[SPEAKER_03]: those days?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh No, man, I know there's a dude he's
He's working pretty hard around the clock
[SPEAKER_02]: working on I would say What month is it
man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I'd say around Christmastime be
looking for looking for a roadkill skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: that'll be coming from ooh We're growing
them out right now Like earlier when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: in that bright-ass room for us got the
rambling on bitching about Girl Scout
[SPEAKER_02]: cookies or whatever I was in a whole whole
room full of different stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had the roadkill skunk There we had the
Rosetta stone some a 13 etc, etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, like that's another one of my
big ones that was something pretty near
[SPEAKER_02]: and dear to me like when I was growing up
and my cousins had made it and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's something that I don't know why
it really isn't around or nobody was on to
[SPEAKER_02]: the same shit we were on to back then but
we're gonna bring that back and That's
[SPEAKER_02]: something definitely people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey do y'all got skunks over there in
Australia?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no like the animals yeah, yeah,
yeah, no, we don't have them Man they
[SPEAKER_02]: stink so goddamn bad, man They will spray
and if you hit one on the road your car
[SPEAKER_02]: will reek.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean really really I've heard the story
the region of Virginia I'm from they're
[SPEAKER_02]: all over the place man So we could get
away with growing big big big huge rows of
[SPEAKER_02]: it in the woods because people drive by
Like a skunk spraying around here,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess man, they don't realize in the
back 40 We got like 200 300 of them girls
[SPEAKER_03]: growing, you know the perfect cover story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Yeah, it was good That's awesome Yeah,
so I'm gonna have to do it bring up the
[SPEAKER_03]: dreaded topic for all breeders feminized
seeds How what's your thoughts on
[SPEAKER_03]: feminized seed?
[SPEAKER_03]: I could probably guess but I think that
um, there is a Bit of an argument to be
[SPEAKER_03]: made that you know, a lot of really good
clones have come from hermaphrodites From
[SPEAKER_03]: feminized seeds, you know, so so what's
your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have a place or not in your
library?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they do And like anything like
there's a like we were talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: filial crossing or back crossing So
there's certain tools that you can use for
[SPEAKER_02]: certain jobs so with Feminize seed there's
a right way to do it And then there's the
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the wrong way is like the typical way
of just like hey, man We'll get some
[SPEAKER_02]: colloidal silver man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll reverse this sucker and make a bunch
of seeds and we'll just throw them out
[SPEAKER_02]: there There is a right way of going about
it, too Which would basically be like
[SPEAKER_02]: during your first first It's not really an
outcross but during your first selfing
[SPEAKER_02]: where you've heard this plan onto itself
or another Plant Oral trick was you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you you grow out a bunch of them you put
them in a room and about day 28 a flower
[SPEAKER_02]: You start doing a disco light effect up in
there where your lights on lights off
[SPEAKER_02]: lights on lights off And you try to you
know, you'll weed them out You'll find the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones like they'll show pretty quick now
out of like, you know hundred and
[SPEAKER_02]: something of these females in there You
might find one that will not herm out on
[SPEAKER_02]: you not easily That would be one that you
would probably want to back cross back To
[SPEAKER_02]: the mother or do it do it like that now
When you're when you're feminizing you're
[SPEAKER_02]: you're cheating yourself out of a
chromosome It could be one that's Not not
[SPEAKER_02]: so much affecting what we're looking for,
you know It could be a structural thing or
[SPEAKER_02]: a color thing or what have you a lot of
the times guys do it It's cheating out the
[SPEAKER_02]: potency a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think like you can do it good,
but you need to have a lot of numbers and
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to run these stress tests or else
you're gonna be passing that
[SPEAKER_02]: hermaphroditic trade-on and you're
actually you're gonna be cheating yourself
[SPEAKER_02]: out of a Good chromosome like potency or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like you can do it but to me like If
you do it, right, it's more work and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not trying to do any more work than I need
to so You know and there is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I was talking to some guys there
from Europe and dudes in Spain and down in
[SPEAKER_02]: South America and like They're not set up
like like an America man like our service
[SPEAKER_02]: like on a house like electrical service
You got like 200 amps like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's pretty pretty good man You can you
can grow out a lot of weed but say in
[SPEAKER_02]: Holland, man You're getting ready to like
blow your breaker panel by having one
[SPEAKER_02]: light, you know, so It's very important
for these guys to know for a fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I got females man I don't have much
space and like it's worth it And like I
[SPEAKER_02]: can sympathize with that a little bit so I
could see where a guy wants to do that
[SPEAKER_02]: Agricultural guys, let's say like we're so
legal that we can grow out fields and
[SPEAKER_02]: fields and fields of weed hundred acres
worth of pot it would be beneficial that
[SPEAKER_02]: if I could grow from seed each time and
Throw out all these seeds and no for a
[SPEAKER_02]: fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any males to call There will
not be any gaps in my rows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna be good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool, too So and like you
were saying a lot of the the really good
[SPEAKER_02]: ones came from accidents, man Really good
accidents, you know, but accidents
[SPEAKER_02]: nonetheless from our hermaphrodite So,
you know, there is some some things to be
[SPEAKER_02]: said like a chem dog, man Every time like
that thing gets pissed off and throws out
[SPEAKER_02]: some pollen everything it hits makes a
legend man But that's just part of the way
[SPEAKER_02]: it breeds man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It it breeds that chemo type along with
that that hermaphroditic pollen So when it
[SPEAKER_02]: hits something it's god-awful potent just
like the mom was, you know So there's
[SPEAKER_02]: certain ones that will do that,
but not all of them do that So just you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, that's the only part to keep in
mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess yeah So what's your thoughts on
people using other breeders genetics,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Do you kind of frown on people
making f2s and then using them for their
[SPEAKER_03]: own projects?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think as long as they kind of
ask permission, it's all right Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: the permission thing is is Probably like
my my one thing and the way like we do
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually encourage people to to use our
stuff to help their breeding program along
[SPEAKER_02]: our only thing is like Just you know,
give us a little a little shout out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, don't be like, oh well Cindy 99
or Durban tie Cindy 99 I'm gonna call it
[SPEAKER_02]: cantaloupe haze now or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we just Bred that we made it,
you know now if they were to be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, yeah, it's brothers Graham blah blah
blah We use this in our program.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool And you know,
I like that and like we kind of saw
[SPEAKER_02]: ourselves as like the breeders breeder You
know, we'll make shit that you would want
[SPEAKER_02]: to breed with you know, something that
would help you out So Cinderella 99 is a
[SPEAKER_02]: good example of that As far as like people
that make like f2s and they're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, yeah, I got these Grimtica f2s $20 a
pack You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean now that pissed me off a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be looking to kick that dude's ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but um, you know it's it's I guess
like I just see a lot of like very
[SPEAKER_02]: ununique people out there that do this
stuff and I just I guess I would say like
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they would like do some of their
own work and Not really just ride off
[SPEAKER_02]: others people's work because you know,
it is a lot of work if you if you are
[SPEAKER_02]: going the original route whether you're
Snatching up land races from you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: different parts of the world or you know
putting a lot of work into something It
[SPEAKER_02]: does take work but you know some people
they take that shortcut but when I see a
[SPEAKER_02]: seed company that say their whole menu is
you know TGA sub cools Agent Orange cross
[SPEAKER_02]: to JJ's Stardog and then they just throw a
name
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Man all over the place man,
and like every time I just see it Shake my
[SPEAKER_02]: head man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like shame on you you unoriginal bastards
So, you know that part kind of bothers me
[SPEAKER_02]: and they don't really put in the work
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just kind of like Sprouted a 10
pack got two males that one looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck it make some seeds make some money,
you know, and then they just End up
[SPEAKER_02]: polluting the gene pool worse than it
already is, you know, they didn't improve
[SPEAKER_02]: nothing They didn't really make nothing
new and they just kind of screwed around
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have friends that have like,
you know, they're like What you call like
[SPEAKER_02]: a closet, you know closet breeders,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But the difference between them and these
guys Well, they ain't selling them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just goofing around having fun in the
basement and just growing shit out for fun
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's a different thing But
when you put down a pack and you put in a
[SPEAKER_02]: layer label on it and you charging people
for money and you're showing You know some
[SPEAKER_02]: picture or something in a description that
ain't nowhere near like what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fugazi, bro Like that that ain't
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah So kind of on that same topic of
ownership.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been hearing a lot of talk about
Patenting of strain names patenting of
[SPEAKER_03]: strains recently, you know, are you able
to maybe shed some truth on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: There seems to be a lot of rumors but from
what I've heard it seems like The end of
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis community from what some
people are talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems a bit ridiculous Yeah,
it is man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's one thing, you know about
stoners man They paranoid and they like to
[SPEAKER_02]: like to have their little conspiracies and
things so a while back Talked to a guy
[SPEAKER_02]: that was doing like a genome project and I
was giving him all these samples of all
[SPEAKER_02]: these different things out of the
collection and like, okay, well You know
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me something I don't know like,
you know, I'm gonna give you say this
[SPEAKER_02]: Triangle Kush right here and I'm gonna
give you this OG Kush and then I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: give you this chem dog and I want you to
tell me like are they related or where do
[SPEAKER_02]: they come from and I'm gonna give you
these landrace Afghanis do any of them
[SPEAKER_02]: show hot from coming from this region and
stuff like that and You know, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty cool stuff and I was like so,
you know when you map this this this plant
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you give me a piece of paper?
[SPEAKER_02]: Saying, you know, this is what it is This
is a very unique genotype here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't replicate this You know when the
patent office opens up, can I patent this?
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer is no Unless you genetically
modify something you can't patent it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how like Monsanto does what they
do They genetically modify potatoes
[SPEAKER_02]: soybeans and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're able to patent those
things, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But they can't Patent the soybean and we
can't do it the same way with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so like my question was like
well What if I get land races from all
[SPEAKER_02]: parts of the world?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I patent these so that way when
Monsanto does come around?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I don't beat these assholes to the
punch and maybe I'll sue them and we'll
[SPEAKER_02]: have a big-ass bonfire in their office
buildings or something, you know So they
[SPEAKER_02]: were like nah, it doesn't work that way So
unless she genetically modified to make it
[SPEAKER_02]: unique you can't patent it So that now the
the name so the name game Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can you well, I don't know about
Abroad or nothing, but in America you you
[SPEAKER_02]: can patent a name, you know, like a brand
name like Coca-Cola or I heard the chem
[SPEAKER_03]: dog name had been patented or something
along those lines Yeah, man Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: he ended up doing it us and some buddies
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking for like, you know a lot
of people Use your name and make a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: money on you and you're sitting at the
house broke Which by the way, like if y
[SPEAKER_02]: 'all think like chem dogs like some big
high roller, you know making all this
[SPEAKER_02]: money You see his weed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody gives them shit like, you know me
JJ a few of the crew You know the chem
[SPEAKER_02]: family crew, you know, we always help out,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of these guys they're claiming
to breed with chem dog 99% of them it
[SPEAKER_02]: ain't it ain't even real chem dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just using a name Also,
they they you know, even if they do they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't they don't kick anything back to the
guy So we're like, well, you know these
[SPEAKER_02]: guys make all this money using your name
Let's put an end to that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: because maybe one day soon the time is
gonna come So where these patents do make
[SPEAKER_02]: it make a difference and what happens if
some jack-off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Patents your name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah now we're getting suited for growing
shit that you know, we help you know get
[SPEAKER_02]: to the Yeah, man and people hey man,
I'll tell you a funny story this dude was
[SPEAKER_02]: on Instagram, man We just chew in his ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: He ended up he trademarked or patented
chem fam Believe that shit what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, man, and then we were telling
like bro, you can't do that shit and he
[SPEAKER_02]: was like, oh, yeah Yeah, I can I got the
patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like man you fixing to get your ass
whoops on so everybody's just like Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we see you man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna take care of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyways, the guy gets scared and he's
like, hey Don't want no problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid like 300 bucks to have this done
Give me 300 bucks and it's yours So we got
[SPEAKER_02]: the money up and made sure that our man's
got that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean people are people are crazy
man, especially Americans man a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: crooked Shisty bastards, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I want to I'm gonna come live
over There with y'all man Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean you'd have to say goodbye to all
that beautiful clones Nah, I know how to
[SPEAKER_02]: get them over there Then you're all set.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sir Australian Australian wife or
something man.
[SPEAKER_02]: She give me a green card or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you wouldn't need a bye.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she'd love your accent sweet Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I was about to say if you're willing to
you know, would you be willing to talk a
[SPEAKER_03]: little more about chem dog?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like he's kind of a really
illustrious figure in the industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know As you pointed out, you know,
a lot of people probably do assume he gets
[SPEAKER_03]: You know some kind of kickbacks from
people using his stuff or just you know
[SPEAKER_03]: Somehow intimately tied to some kind of
financial gain from the seeds You think
[SPEAKER_03]: he's just more of you know a mellow guy
like I know he used to breed He kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: stopped doing that Yeah, so um When I got
out of prison, so I went in February 2007
[SPEAKER_02]: then I get out like around November 2009
So like I'm playing it cool, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I'm like, alright, I'm getting out
man DEA They probably still watching me.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't think they got what they wanted
They think I'm high rolling in some money,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I won't but whatever they want to
think so I'm like I'm not gonna contact
[SPEAKER_02]: nobody because if I do contact somebody
and they are watching I'm gonna lead them
[SPEAKER_02]: right to my friends and my family and I
ain't gonna have that I just got through
[SPEAKER_02]: pulling all that time for not running my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So You know, I'm just gonna chill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I get done with my probation And
I traveled to Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like middle like the desert out in
America It's like middle south middle part
[SPEAKER_02]: of the country, you know, so I get out
there with old friend from Florida,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was an East Coast guy with me and We
just got to talk and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah You know, how's old G doing you keep
in contact with him?
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, yeah, you know talk to him a
little bit I'm like, yeah, man,
[SPEAKER_02]: we we ought to get a hold of him,
you know, just you know catch up so we go
[SPEAKER_02]: and I mean, it's like the next day and we
see the damn news strip popping up.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got Boston Dude snatched on him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so Now I don't have it on paper and
like there's really not like a whole lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of proof But you know who res dog is
reservoir seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of avoiding bringing his name
up in relation to Ken Yeah, I know right
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking do the old fucking Yeah,
it's like a vampire man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that Joker he gets popped and starts
running his mouth man Gypsy nirvana a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of dudes go down right around the
same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: He knew where G lived You know had hung
out with him before Anyway, now G's
[SPEAKER_02]: popped, you know, he's going away.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're like, well fuck me, you know So
don't I don't hear from him, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and like I'm in Arizona I end up going
back to Virginia and doing my thing there
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm just you know, staying quiet and
then So basically, you know, I hung around
[SPEAKER_02]: Virginia for my for my parents,
you know, they were really Old when they
[SPEAKER_02]: had me and they weren't doing too good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway when my father passed away I
said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like living here no more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm tired of getting hunted down like an
animal I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm driving straight to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I drove all the way to Oregon man
Second, I touched down call up sub cool my
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, what's up man made it all the way out
here Got all my old clones got the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do let's do something cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So He's like, hey man, you want to get a
job working with the cannabis people?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to start an Instagram and I'm
like I insta what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'm not a big technological dude,
you know, like you can probably tell So
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, all right, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll start up an Instagram and sure enough
Old G hits me up Kim doll glass and I
[SPEAKER_02]: said, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, man I didn't know if he was in
the joint out of the joint or whatever so
[SPEAKER_02]: get to talk and he was like, yeah,
you know, everything's alright But they
[SPEAKER_02]: took my house man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They found me like seven hundred thousand
dollars man and ain't got no money So I
[SPEAKER_02]: started taking up glass blowing again and
back in like Oh, oh five or six He tried
[SPEAKER_02]: to get me all of his glass blowing
equipment and I told him no I said you
[SPEAKER_02]: might end up needing it again one day
Thank God he didn't because now he's
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking blowing glass with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's yeah, so he's still back in
Massachusetts just blowing glass man And
[SPEAKER_02]: by the way, if y'all want some real cool
old-school heady glass man, hit him up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Kim dog and it's spelled do G by the
way, everybody's that do da WG that ain't
[SPEAKER_02]: the way to spell it says CH EM do G
underscore glass and Yeah, he make he
[SPEAKER_02]: makes some real real nice stuff,
man Yeah, everyone needs to go and pay
[SPEAKER_03]: their respects and buy some glass from Kim
dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah He'll he'll hook it up man,
and he puts a lot of little millies in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know So like y'all y'all got y'all
seen South Park over there, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, the cartoon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like he's got a bunch of shit from
that man Like he made me a little bowl
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a tally on it and stuff and
Herman Simpson and you know, we were all
[SPEAKER_02]: big deadheads, too So, you know a lot of a
lot of grateful dad stuff on there,
[SPEAKER_03]: too Yeah, I was about to say I've just
organized to get my my chem family shirt
[SPEAKER_03]: through here Heddies and hair heirlooms
the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm excited to get it Hell yeah,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good shirts, too, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my p-bud shirt on today Yeah,
but uh Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're they're they're all good
people and we weren't like we're not like
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody always saw like oh, yeah,
y'all like some rich motherfuckers like
[SPEAKER_02]: some real high rollers at the end of the
day We just a bunch of like broke ass
[SPEAKER_02]: dirty ass Deadheads man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just like we just love growing weed
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like a passion So we're not any
famous star High roller whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're just a bunch of farmers
that like growing weed and believing what
[SPEAKER_02]: we doing You know, we like to help people
and you know, yeah spread the love you
[SPEAKER_02]: will ain't enough love in this world too
much hate Yeah, I can totally agree on
[SPEAKER_03]: that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So does Cam kind of keep out of the
limelight due to his kind of notoriety
[SPEAKER_03]: nowadays and he just sticks to the
glasswork Is that kind of why he stopped
[SPEAKER_03]: breeding?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cuz I know that he made things like,
you know, the Giesel and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he had the Giesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had the dog days There was the snow dog
Good old days man, like where we were just
[SPEAKER_02]: having fun man and You know the the laws
and the cops man, they they put a they put
[SPEAKER_02]: a quick end to that and like myself If
they were to come through the door right
[SPEAKER_02]: now Well, actually now I'm all protected
so I told him to suck my dick but but like
[SPEAKER_02]: last month if they were to come through
the door I was looking at like 15 to 20
[SPEAKER_02]: years man and same same goes for him I
think they got medical where he's at but
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he's trying to keep it down low
and yeah, you know just kind of mellow out
[SPEAKER_02]: and maybe You know when some more laws
change or whatever You'll see him see him
[SPEAKER_02]: out and about a bit more, but you know,
he's a family man He's got his kids and
[SPEAKER_02]: he's got his old lady that tries to keep
him out of trouble and you know that whole
[SPEAKER_02]: deal Yeah, man, but real good,
dude Like say he's real real into his
[SPEAKER_02]: glass blowing to east bullet glass on dead
tour and sell them out low out in the
[SPEAKER_02]: parking lot Oh really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's been doing this shit long time,
man That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and so I guess my ultimate question
would be have you ever spoken to him about
[SPEAKER_03]: What he plans on doing with those
remaining seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Man the the DEA took them Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've never read them Yeah,
they're in an evidence room somewhere man
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, they they took them bastards,
but um, I think this is groundbreaking.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think this no one knows about this
Oh, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that when they come and got him they
got his seed collection as clones and all
[SPEAKER_02]: but we Collectively, you know,
we've kept all of our own seed breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: old seeds clones and we got it all we got
it stored away and he's He's well set and
[SPEAKER_02]: then um Plus, you know the the the mother
plant that produced these Kim dog seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, you could say that so we You
know fuck them, you know, they whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: they take man will build it bigger and
better than we had it before, you know
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a huge thing I say to anyone
as soon as they find something unique you
[SPEAKER_03]: need to delocalize it because it's just
too risky to hoard things and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I always Use the example of the alien
technology strain as much as it might have
[SPEAKER_03]: been a bit of a fad, you know It doesn't
exist anymore because the guy who found it
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't give any cuts out and then he lost
it himself Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that guy too, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when he's probably see Yeah,
yeah, that's um Yeah, I remember like
[SPEAKER_02]: they're just land race Afghanis man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it was and I found a good boy I
remember he showed me pictures of it when
[SPEAKER_02]: it was real little man Had the cod
leadings and like one set of leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: growing out and had fucking frost on it
like a bug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Shit, and then that's the one he used
called it the alien tech and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it does good That's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot to be said about you know,
you introduce land race to a hybrid,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can you can do some pretty cool
stuff man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Sure, so kind of the last of the more
extended questions What do you think is
[SPEAKER_03]: the best way for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of a community to grow if it's in its
infancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in in reference to say, Australia We
don't really have clones that get passed
[SPEAKER_03]: around I'm sure there are people with
high-quality clones, but we don't have a
[SPEAKER_03]: scene really, you know, that's something
we're trying to establish What do you
[SPEAKER_03]: think's the most important you think do
you think it would be trying to get you
[SPEAKER_03]: know Get people to be passing genetics
around and from their strains will develop
[SPEAKER_03]: or do you think maybe?
[SPEAKER_03]: Try to work on getting the legalization
model and then you've got a bit more room
[SPEAKER_03]: to work within there So what what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess guided us back in the day is like
when everything was illegal as can be It
[SPEAKER_02]: was the passion and all that driving us to
make something better or like we find
[SPEAKER_02]: something cool, man We keep hold of it and
then like, you know, you meet guys,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you're a grateful dead toy You
know these guys a couple years they they
[SPEAKER_02]: grow killer weed You grow killer weed you
trust each other and you're like,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got this awesome roadkill skunk man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want it?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hold it Hold on to it for me in
case something happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can come back and get that back for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like yeah, cool Well, I got this really
awesome Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want this and absolutely and that's
it's like starts off as a slow network and
[SPEAKER_02]: then From that, you know, I might have
that Afghani and then call him up in a
[SPEAKER_02]: year and say hey, man I was fucking around
grew some roadkill seeds and Pollinated
[SPEAKER_02]: your Afghani.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grows it out finds another clone and
then he might have another buddy here's
[SPEAKER_02]: this clone and it really starts off slow
and clone trading up until I guess the
[SPEAKER_02]: real Legalization was going on like with
the medical and all that it won't it won't
[SPEAKER_02]: really a whole lot of people trading a
whole lot because trust issues and You
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't want to like let people knew know
you grow like though So like the old
[SPEAKER_02]: forums like over grow and stuff like that,
you know We did a little bit of trading
[SPEAKER_02]: because you could maintain Your anonymous
this a little bit, you know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: so like for the longest time, you know
name like Duke diamond You think I
[SPEAKER_02]: probably look like a pimp, you know what I
mean gold chains and you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was an alias.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just tried to make the opposite of what
I look like and who I am So, you know like
[SPEAKER_02]: us to me like years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would have been nuts man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like nobody knew my face Nobody knew where
I was from or what I talk like or none of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as the thing Progressed, you know these
dispensaries open up they start selling
[SPEAKER_02]: clones and you know people are openly
trading a little bit more It kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: starts like a wildfire man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets out of control quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is you get a lot of
Illegitimate cuts like a guy's like hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got this sour diesel, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey sour diesel at all, you know,
and but it gets passed around to 150
[SPEAKER_02]: people it all swear to God This is sour
diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I paid $100 for this cutting or my buddy
will You know that whole whole yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: so I would say now like in your in the
infancy of it over there just keep growing
[SPEAKER_02]: from seed find your really exceptional
stuff and just hang on to them,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and As y'all get more and more
and you get that more community thing
[SPEAKER_02]: where whether it's a forum or y'all are so
far along to where We can all go down to
[SPEAKER_02]: the park at like some cannabis rally or
whatever and you meet people and You know
[SPEAKER_02]: just treat it like you would anything else
like if you grew tomatoes in your
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetable garden and your neighbor's cool
And he's into it too, you know hang out
[SPEAKER_02]: man, and you know help each other along
Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically don't shy away from giving
people you trust things that you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: hang on to Yeah, like I always said It's
good to have a good backup guy now you
[SPEAKER_02]: back up guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're in like the breeding world
You don't necessarily want to pass Things
[SPEAKER_02]: out because it's like giving out the
coca-cola secret, you don't want everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: to have it, you know But there were
certain things I made that man I wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody to have it, you know,
so, you know pick and choose On kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: what goes out there, but I will say this
People are people and If you don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: something to ever get out there never give
it to a single soul But be prepared if
[SPEAKER_02]: something happens And you lose it you
don't lost it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you know, it's just kind of one
of them deals too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah for sure So for the last little part,
I was just hoping we could just do some
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of more light-hearted short random
questions Just maybe novelty interest to
[SPEAKER_03]: people So the first one is if you could go
back to one Yeah, it's looking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Yeah, man solid So if you could go back
to one place and one time in history To
[SPEAKER_03]: get some land race seeds Where would you
pick and you know, whatever?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be in Afghanistan and I'd be in
Lebanon from like the 70s man right before
[SPEAKER_02]: 1978 when the Russians tried to invade
Afghanistan, I'd be all over that some
[SPEAKER_03]: bitch Back when the hippie trail was open
Back when the hippie trail was open Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: man, exactly and I'd be I'd be rounding up
stuff from there I would have probably
[SPEAKER_02]: done that and Hell man Anywhere in
Thailand if I if I knew I won't gonna get
[SPEAKER_02]: caught and like Executed by a firing squad
for finding some seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd probably be all over that place But
yeah, primarily like Lebanon Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_02]: Pakistan right along that Hindu Kush
mountain range.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah So next one, what's what's the worst
thing to happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: To the scene since you've been involved in
it in your opinion What's the worst thing
[SPEAKER_02]: you said yeah Man where do I start?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say Shit man Where to start um,
you can throw a few out if you want I
[SPEAKER_02]: would say When legalization happened you
had a lot of rich people With money just
[SPEAKER_02]: looking to score more money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know shit about what they're
doing The quality went down the prices go
[SPEAKER_02]: up and they just screw the whole game up
for everybody They don't know shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like the number one problem for
like misinformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Went into this one store just to have a
good laugh at what was in there And a
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble kush man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the shittiest looking weed I ever
seen and they say yes bubble kush,
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's bubble gum cross the kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, yeah You don't say you know
and like you'll hear yeah Kim dog,
[SPEAKER_02]: man That's some this and this crossed
together and we made it here in our shop
[SPEAKER_02]: like yeah, okay cool so that there's one
to I would say like high times magazine
[SPEAKER_02]: man there there Terrible there there it
says nothing but just bullshit long time
[SPEAKER_02]: ago it used to be full of like a lot of
good grow information and good stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: now it's like what's the latest rapper
rapping about and you know a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: titties and ass and advertising,
you know, most of the magazines
[SPEAKER_02]: advertisement for really shitty seeds and
shitty seed banks that You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you do get a little
information It's buried underneath some
[SPEAKER_02]: interview with some rapper who doesn't
give a shit about medicine or cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: community or whatever He's just concerned
with money and making songs And they
[SPEAKER_02]: glorify people like that There's like
certain ones even they they were
[SPEAKER_02]: informants man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were snitches these people were like
Pieces of shit and they're sitting there
[SPEAKER_02]: glorifying this guy in a magazine And you
know and like they they're killing us and
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't care about us But you know,
they're gonna they're gonna do that
[SPEAKER_02]: because of the money So the guys are
really just chasing the money They forgot
[SPEAKER_02]: about the passion and the real reason why
we do what we're doing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so that's definitely a real bad one and
then yeah, the The the pollution of the
[SPEAKER_02]: gene pool was a pretty bad one that's been
going on for a while But I'd say in the
[SPEAKER_02]: last two three years, it's gotten real
ridiculous, you know So those those are
[SPEAKER_02]: probably my top three top three groans and
moans Yeah Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who's a breeder who you would love to
see the Brothers Grimm do?
[SPEAKER_02]: a collaboration with Mmm, so we got uh,
we got two that are coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they're getting ready to get started
Yeah, man, you got one with top dog seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have two favorites Yeah,
and swamp boy seeds, too So they're two
[SPEAKER_02]: two friends of mine cornbread Ricky and
JJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll definitely be doing those two for
sure If I had anybody else Mmm,
[SPEAKER_02]: my mind's kind of going blank but you can
definitely be sure we'll be doing some
[SPEAKER_02]: more cool stuff with other people but um
Yeah, those two right off the top of my
[SPEAKER_02]: head.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're definitely doing those So we'll have
like a little triangle Kush Cindy 99
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrid and a star dog see 99 hybrid
awesome So, uh, what's your current
[SPEAKER_03]: favorite strain and what's your favorite
strain of all time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a tough question bubble,
um, yeah, well Shit man, that's tough,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, you know the question You're a
tough man, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I Don't know I would say I Can I can
give you like a top ten?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure So I would say like For daytime
like I need to do work and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say like the Cinderella 99 the
Apollo's, you know This would be definite
[SPEAKER_02]: favorites For just getting stoned as shit,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say Kim dog, you know hands down
without a doubt If I want to feel weird
[SPEAKER_02]: like trippy weird man like Durbin Hi flyer
the DTC 99 stuff along those Flavor and
[SPEAKER_02]: like just put me out knock me out to
sleep, you know, I would say Hash plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that 88 hash plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are definite definite winners and
for flavor I have this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've you seen it a local H that It's more
sour than sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for flavor and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that like triangle Kush to
Triangle gets me fucked up man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get real high man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did I Did actually spend quite a while
googling local H trying to figure out what
[SPEAKER_02]: it was So there was a band in America Like
y'all y'all probably heard it that you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, I'm talking about local H.
[SPEAKER_03]: Had a song called Eddie better Yeah,
I found the bear trying to find weed
[SPEAKER_03]: references.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well see like I never I never Really let
that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one buddy back home.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a hermit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He don't leave the house for nothing and
When I was rounding my clones back up He
[SPEAKER_02]: was the only guy I ever gave it to because
I know you don't talk to people man He
[SPEAKER_02]: talks like animals and trees and shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't leave the house So I know it
ain't going nowhere not off of that
[SPEAKER_02]: property at least so I give it to him Go
back years later man, and he's still doing
[SPEAKER_02]: the same shit man growing the same strains
under the same equipment and everything's
[SPEAKER_02]: good and kept and I got her back and So
back in the day when we when we originally
[SPEAKER_02]: made it and we were growing it out We're
like wow this shit is killer and we were
[SPEAKER_02]: playing that look we had local H to CD as
the as good as dead You know, anyway,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's playing on loop, you know We've done
dried it cured it smoke it and like there
[SPEAKER_02]: was a line in the song Like you just don't
get it and I was like, yeah motherfuckers
[SPEAKER_02]: ain't gonna get this man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We keeping this one in So they get the
bud, but they ain't getting this so we
[SPEAKER_03]: ended up calling it local H Nice fitting
name Yeah, so kind of on the opposite end
[SPEAKER_03]: of the spectrum Yeah, and feel free to
list a few.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your favorite slide?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry your most hated Strain slash what
are some of the worst in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm how long you got
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see and Man, that's a tough one,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not I'm not real big on Girl Scout
cookies or any of its hybrids All the fake
[SPEAKER_02]: sour all the fake chem dog I hate that
They think nastiest we nastiest we I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know Since the since the seeds man,
they put out some fucking garbage now man
[SPEAKER_02]: like it ain't like it was in the 90s and
80s There's stuff now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's just atrocious man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had this shit here in America The
Canadians are growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Beasters man and Beasters It
looks like it's thick old wet nugget and
[SPEAKER_02]: not a damn track home on it ain't got no
actually does have a smell smells like hey
[SPEAKER_02]: and The shit was dirt cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could get it like pounds were cheap
sell it to dumb customers College kids
[SPEAKER_02]: make a couple bucks, but it was worthless
weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so nasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so bad We even had shirts that said
friends don't let friends smoke Beasters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one was pretty bad So like most of
like what since he seeds grows out now
[SPEAKER_02]: reminds me of the beast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah A lot of what you get commercially
available in Australia is pretty similar
[SPEAKER_03]: to the Beasters from what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's not good at all Yeah,
it looks like very orange Looking hair
[SPEAKER_02]: like it got pulled about two weeks too
early Super dense, but no resin smells
[SPEAKER_02]: like hey doesn't get you high Yeah,
maybe one of one of our big problems is
[SPEAKER_03]: the use of plant growth regulators It's
it's really predominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's just horrible for the scene
Yeah, man, and the whole like the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: deal is man is like Like it just starts
off real small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what's that fucker?
[SPEAKER_02]: TSL The fucking poet, you know,
you had the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't start with a bang and starts
with the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah slippery slope It really is man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you get some good seeds get getting
over there And you get some you get some
[SPEAKER_02]: good some good grow technology and the
best way to do it I used to do this with
[SPEAKER_02]: when I was doing our solar panel
engineering is if you learn one you do one
[SPEAKER_02]: And you teach one so if everybody takes
that approach like you learn some good
[SPEAKER_02]: asshole Methodologies man, you grow out
some killer weed you turn on your friend
[SPEAKER_02]: to it and say hey smoke this shit And when
they're like man, how'd you do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, hey, man Let me show you how
easy it is But I'm gonna show you but in
[SPEAKER_02]: return when you get done chopping you need
to show a friend and then they in turn
[SPEAKER_02]: show a friend and within a year You'll
have a pretty big organic good killer weed
[SPEAKER_02]: market Going on there man that just starts
with good genetics and you know a good
[SPEAKER_02]: good foundation of you know Organic
growing skills, which I mean, it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even not even that hard man You
know my dumbass can do it anybody can do
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I think that's what's surprising is
like how much easier organic is and yet
[SPEAKER_03]: somehow it's so like hydroponic is so much
more prevalent Yeah, man, like I mean shit
[SPEAKER_02]: like these fucking plant man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I got no back Battery man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going on a tour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these plants in here man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This dirt is uh Let me think it's over a
year old dirt man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I haven't amended it I ain't done
shit and look at all these motherfuckers
[SPEAKER_02]: man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean nice big no deficiencies,
man gorgeous nice healthy and green,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know just happy as can be and I mean
the simple simple man All I do,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just give them tea, you know
every two weeks and you know, there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiencies in this shit You know,
they're nice and nice and stout and bushy
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's that 88 Right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh gorgeous Yeah, man, and I mean super
simple is purple oracle Big old bus thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't think I've ever seen one
that big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, that's what she said
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, so yeah this big old purple
oracle there's that jack hair I was
[SPEAKER_02]: telling you about see how tall and lanky
that fucker is man He's certainly not
[SPEAKER_02]: indica Yeah, definitely not man.
[SPEAKER_02]: But uh, it throws some big buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the genius right here The other
all the Apollo's and stuff Do you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: keep the genius and the princess on fairly
tight?
[SPEAKER_03]: Lockdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like yeah, we never really really got that
out There's a couple of people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: held on to it as backup, but they're kind
of the same deal They're hermit types.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really associate with other
other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, this is the princess right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had the genius So I'm sorry,
they're all kind of hacked up from taking
[SPEAKER_03]: clones But I was about to because of the
clones or do they have quite a different
[SPEAKER_03]: structure like the other princess looks To
be, you know more kind of Christmas tree
[SPEAKER_02]: ish Yeah, exactly man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like that just goes to show people Like
you can take one little gene pool man,
[SPEAKER_02]: and man you could go on infinitely working
that thing You know, you don't need a
[SPEAKER_02]: million strains Like we can work fuck
probably 50 different variants just all
[SPEAKER_02]: from one plant Even though like this
princess and this genius their sisters,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they grow totally different man Like
you said Christmas tree and then that long
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinky kinky kind of branch thing going on,
you know that shrub.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that shrub structure Yeah,
man, but yeah, like and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like one when one of these moms like it's
too big like a Cindy We just took some
[SPEAKER_02]: clones off over.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna retire this mom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So over here We got all these clones
getting ready to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what I have this will take the
healthiest one And then I'll come back
[SPEAKER_02]: over here He said big-ass trunk on that
sucker man We'll chop her off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll cut a little hole out right here
Yeah, and I'll drop that clone right back
[SPEAKER_02]: in there and just give it water and I'll
grow another one of these That's same Same
[SPEAKER_02]: pot same everything man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like this that just happened not too
long ago with this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a gooey Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: the gooey is a strain which Not not many
people seem to know about her in my
[SPEAKER_03]: opinion yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certainly one which should get more
attention I think what's your opinions on
[SPEAKER_03]: her?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's killer, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ain't nothing on earth more pineapple
even that thing and It's really killer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very potent gooey breeder He's like
he's like one of them unknown breeder
[SPEAKER_02]: legends man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude know how to do his thing and
Just gets overlooked by people and I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know why but Yeah, super killer man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then Yeah, and all these just
like I said, they just went right back
[SPEAKER_02]: into another pot This is a strawberry
diesel coffin cut right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This would be like one of our new releases
It's getting hit with Cindy 99 and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: making it's called the ice coffin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hybrid common and we'll have the Sour
diesel bean pole.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how sour diesel coin grows right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus anybody Get says and they look like
little indica plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're full of shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's big old tall beanpole and this
is a one of our males See how thick that
[SPEAKER_02]: is for a male man.
[SPEAKER_02]: She that's such beautiful structure Yeah,
man, that's our new Cindy male One out of
[SPEAKER_03]: a thousand is that the one I am I saw on
the Instagram which is the the kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: genius phenotype Now that's that was
another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our piece 75.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry my mistake Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're all good that one's He said we
keep them kind of hacked up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not the prettiest but and that
was that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of hard to see the Great
branching So, yeah, man like we got got
[SPEAKER_02]: males and males and males and and most
people throwing them away, but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: another male And there's that Apollo 11
mom Yeah, so like I mean, you know like if
[SPEAKER_02]: you take like I say 11 it's genius and
then you got Cinderella 99 as a male so
[SPEAKER_02]: you see this plant, you know So it's
sativa leaf and everything and you've seen
[SPEAKER_02]: the buds on Instagram and yeah smells like
ripe red Grapefruit and tastes like gummy
[SPEAKER_02]: bears, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you take over here sounds divine
So this Apollo 13 this is a P 75 which is
[SPEAKER_02]: the precursor to Cindy 99 So it's 75%
princess whereas c99 is 94% right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that little percentile difference gives
you a totally different plant this thing
[SPEAKER_02]: smells like skunk's ass and mango and
tastes like fuel So just you know just
[SPEAKER_02]: from that slight slight change,
man So it's pretty and you can see it's
[SPEAKER_02]: got a wider leaf, you know It's the little
bit coming through from the she the skunk
[SPEAKER_02]: which is skunk in l5 So, you know just off
of one little change man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You end up with a whole lot of difference,
man Yeah, so when you guys um started
[SPEAKER_03]: making these again and you decided to
reuse the P 75 genetics for example Was
[SPEAKER_03]: that because you kind of thought that um,
the genetics were proven and it was worth
[SPEAKER_03]: using them and you know Maybe you know For
example the I believe it was a Shiva skunk
[SPEAKER_03]: male.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr Soul originally used You know was the
kind of idea that you know, like that was
[SPEAKER_03]: a really good male It was a solid
foundation to work from or was it more so
[SPEAKER_03]: just kind of saving some time thinking You
know, like why make P 50 again and work it
[SPEAKER_02]: out when we could just start from P 75
Yeah, so we know that like the P 75
[SPEAKER_02]: generation that certain things were were
able to happen with that generation and um
[SPEAKER_02]: it tended to Not over dominate the mother
so much so it made like more sense to use
[SPEAKER_02]: it and f1 outcrosses like say You know
Rosetta Stone for instance, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We can use that we had some speedy nice,
you know influences and everything But we
[SPEAKER_02]: don't like overwhelm what we're really
liking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like the mom That's why we're using her
to make this f1 outcross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So If we like her, you know, we want to
add like some cool shit to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we'd like to improve it But we
don't want to like over dominate it now if
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to really make something really
new and like over dominant or you know
[SPEAKER_02]: Make something kind of completely
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll use that Cinderella 99 and then that
actually You know does it saying and the
[SPEAKER_02]: main reason is just the way that P 75
passes its gene pairs along and the
[SPEAKER_02]: frequencies of those gene pairs it makes
it Like a real good dad for making some
[SPEAKER_02]: unique f1 stuff But at the same time kind
of remaining true to mama, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes perfect sense So, um,
I mean just looking at the garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean Obviously people will get to see
when they're watching this, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants look fantastic What's kind of
the the biggest thing you notice when you
[SPEAKER_03]: walk into someone else's garden?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's you know, what's the big mistake
most people seem to be doing or you know
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a common one you kind of come across
They water too much over watering I'm a
[SPEAKER_02]: bit guilty of that myself Yeah,
the over watering Is a real fine line if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing organics and you got real
good microbial life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually really hard to over water
them to the degree where they're like
[SPEAKER_02]: Adversely affected, you know If you use
smart pots, you know them fabric fabric
[SPEAKER_02]: pots Yeah, yeah, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the shit you get like 30% more
yielding them socks too, man And you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: really over water them too much like
they'll they'll dry out pretty good
[SPEAKER_02]: because they breathe real good but um,
I like to you know, like I'll water but
[SPEAKER_02]: You know feel them out Like if I can't
like if I lift that pot up and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: the weight in the bottom like it looks dry
man She can feel that weight in the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: let her ride another day until she's kind
of lightening up a little bit and I like
[SPEAKER_02]: to go Every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I'd say like that room as a show
and y'all You know, it's this day one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watered him yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I mean, they're good and healthy,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let them get to where like I feel
that weight in the bottom because I know
[SPEAKER_02]: like those roots from the transplant
haven't made it all the way to the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I water them again, I'm gonna
water them about enough to dampen up that
[SPEAKER_02]: top two-thirds again, right just to Keep
the plant going and then like I kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: maintain that for about two weeks and then
I let it come to Not totally dry,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that pot's pretty damn light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people are freaked out, but you'll
notice man The leaves will be up there
[SPEAKER_02]: praying just like that, you know That lets
you know they're happy man So then you you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, you give them water and you repeat
that process and then after two weeks Let
[SPEAKER_02]: her come to a little more of a drive.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps to tease the roots along it
allows them to breathe some real serious
[SPEAKER_02]: good breaths of oxygen and Typically when
I let them dry out the next water and I
[SPEAKER_02]: normally try to make it a real healthy
feed so they kind of uptake a lot more and
[SPEAKER_02]: I also like to reintroduce more microbes
because like by letting it dry out a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit if I lose any microbes,
you know by letting it get a little too
[SPEAKER_02]: dry I'm putting them right back in so they
can keep you shitting and getting yeah So,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know every two weeks, you know,
you keep that schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't get no root rot problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You won't get no fungus and things like
that and Actually in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's called a crop pushing So like you're
kind of starving them almost so that
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit and then when you do hit them
It's like me and you man You starve us for
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple days and throw us in like a
buffet man me and you're gonna eat so
[SPEAKER_02]: we're sick Like our guts are gonna be all
swole out like But they kind of do the
[SPEAKER_02]: same thing and you'll see them flowers
start to burst and out like crazy,
[SPEAKER_02]: man that's what I was saying like you kind
of with a horse in the carrot thing,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like you you kind of want to
Stimulate them to do something But you
[SPEAKER_02]: also kind of want to reward them with what
they need to respond that way with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so yeah Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if you've seen it but a
new kind of hot thing is a vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_03]: deficit How much are you a believer in
this whole vapor pressure deficit if
[SPEAKER_03]: you've ever heard of it and even kind of
The more general question is um,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's your kind of number one growing tip
for people?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know If you give someone one growing
tip to someone who already grows,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, what do you think something
people kind of do wrong?
[SPEAKER_02]: Overfeeding I notice a lot of plants man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They especially ones add more the sour
fully taste They tend to eat less now like
[SPEAKER_02]: when they're over feeding them they think
hey man the plant it ain't burning ain't
[SPEAKER_02]: no burn on the leaf, so Obviously they're
you know, it's not too much but that's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually that's wrong man because
sometimes you can feed them too much They
[SPEAKER_02]: won't burn but they get complacent like
they'll just sit there and limbo just not
[SPEAKER_02]: really getting any bigger So and there's a
lot of people feed too much and like those
[SPEAKER_02]: fuel strains man Like I can feed like if
my one buddy's doing his normal thing
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding the shit out of this plant I can
feed a third of the amount of what he's
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding it and I'll yield twice as much as
that sucker so Some plants are used to
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a whole lot with very little and you
kind of look at like their origins You
[SPEAKER_02]: know if you're on the top of a mountain in
Afghanistan You really used to getting a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole lot of rain and used to getting a
whole lot of good food So when you do get
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit you can do a lot with it But
you know too much man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just get complacent on you So I would
say don't overfeed them and try try
[SPEAKER_02]: different things, you know and take it
slow like you can't You can't learn a
[SPEAKER_02]: strain in one grow I'm growing some of
these things 20 years and I still learn
[SPEAKER_02]: new shit about them each time and they're
kind of like people I would say Their
[SPEAKER_02]: language is sign language, but it ain't
like deaf people sign languages plant sign
[SPEAKER_02]: language So if you can learn how to speak
their language You leaps and bounds ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you learn how like how do they sign
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I need calcium Hey, I need nitrogen
or hey, I'm happy as shit or whatever you
[SPEAKER_02]: learn their signs And each plants gonna be
a little different and it's just like your
[SPEAKER_02]: close friend that you grew up with for 20
30 years You know when he's tired man.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got that certain look about him You
know when he might be getting a little
[SPEAKER_02]: hungry a little grumpy and you'll start to
pick up on these things with those plants
[SPEAKER_02]: so get to know them just like you do any
any any person or friend of yours or
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatnot and you know, just take it slow
and try a little bit, you know Start low
[SPEAKER_02]: and work yourself up and then you might
say okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well You know, I got less yield this time
and I fed just that a little bit more Let
[SPEAKER_02]: me go back to where I was last time that
was about right and play around with your
[SPEAKER_02]: harvest dates You know, like one day can
make a considerable difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got one strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a 48-hour window You're up there
at like 28 percent THC and if you miss
[SPEAKER_02]: that window by early a day or two or late
a day or two You're all the way down to 20
[SPEAKER_02]: percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 9 percent a 48-hour window.
[SPEAKER_02]: So play around with that a little bit too
like I mean the shit a blow your head off
[SPEAKER_02]: if you get it right, but It's real good
either way, but man you hit it just right
[SPEAKER_03]: Lord It's tough window of opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like oh Man, it's so tough and
like if you were to be around me working
[SPEAKER_02]: man You'd laugh your ass off over sit
there pacing back and forth by the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: all day like man Should I pull it ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's ready and I fuck up in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I off a day?
Am I?
[SPEAKER_02]: On a day in my head a day man shit and I
don't know when to pull it and then I just
[SPEAKER_02]: Go by my gut and say well, it seems right
and then I pull it and 99% of the time Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get it and sometimes shit happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah that it does So uh time for a bit of
a random product endorsement.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's a one product you'd recommend to
everyone?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm For growing yeah, you know if anything
if you recommend it it must be good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, um I was gonna say something
dirty as shit, but I ain't gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um Yeah, you know what I'm gonna recommend
So I would definitely recommend for
[SPEAKER_02]: growing I would say dragonfly earth
mountain Medicine that is hands-down the
[SPEAKER_02]: best product I've used Ever like a lot of
that stuff is like what I used to have to
[SPEAKER_02]: make on my own Which you know,
I never had a problem with but growing
[SPEAKER_02]: this amount at this scale It does make it
a little difficult for me And man the
[SPEAKER_02]: results spoke for themselves, man I won't
I won't go back to using anything else So
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the dragonfly earth medicine
line that makes organic grow and easy as
[SPEAKER_02]: hell man you take all that you know secret
knowledge and little tricks and all that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff and they've done it all for you they
got it in a little bucket and You just
[SPEAKER_02]: take a scoop throw it in the water pH it
let it brew and you're good to go man It's
[SPEAKER_02]: real easy simple and it's real nice stuff
and they're real nice people too,
[SPEAKER_03]: man They're like Buddhist, you know nice
So I think that just about wraps it up to
[SPEAKER_03]: be honest Is there any shoutouts or any
just general comments you wanted to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man shoutouts time It's everybody in
Australia, man y'all are cool-ass people
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm glad that uh, you know that y'all
can legally do this thing But don't do

[SPEAKER_02]: heart grow it good grow from your heart
and try to help people and I never met an
[SPEAKER_02]: Australian person I didn't like Everybody
