[SPEAKER_01]: out part one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend you do it was a killer In this
part of the episode we chat more chem dog
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics some history on top dog seeds and
some more about the future So without
[SPEAKER_01]: further ado Let's get into it Amazing
amazing and by the way, I love the name
[SPEAKER_01]: wheelchair for a strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to be the best I mean if we
just go back you Spoke about the the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic drift you've seen in plants and a
question that comes to my mind about that
[SPEAKER_01]: is do you think a similar thing happened
with the original sour diesel because it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems like so many people would just The
original sour diesel was the best thing
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd ever had, you know They people talk
about the delivery services in the 90s and
[SPEAKER_01]: how it was just so good And now it sort of
feels like it's been lost in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think has happened to the real
sour diesel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's it's probably
has drifted a little bit I mean some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cuts that I've gotten back recently
have gotten that kind of variegation that
[SPEAKER_00]: mosaic But I don't think it's the mosaic
disease but it is some type of Virus I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe I've been seeing it a lot on a lot
of older cuts You know has that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: little variegation to it like the like the
Chem D does But you know, the Chem D has
[SPEAKER_00]: always had it since day one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean Yeah, so I think some of the
sour diesel is I mean you got to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about it I mean that stuff, you know has
been around since you know 95 So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how many years is that you know,
and so It really reaches the point You
[SPEAKER_00]: know you get a cutting You know,
how many generations old is that by now by
[SPEAKER_00]: the time you get it, you know So and you
know, even you know, like a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know they don't keep mothers They
just go from clone to clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know after a long period of time
you know, there's got to be some type of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic drift that happens and Yeah It's
really hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess some strains a little bit more
hardier than others I guess I have seen I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess indigo is kind of dead out faster
than sativa's but yeah, I think some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Some of us sours are getting kind of
old So and that's why I kind of decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: you know start to do some back-crossing
And I've gotten to the back cross fours,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that really Wasn't my intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted to do the back cross three
and I have back cross three f2s I just
[SPEAKER_00]: popped and I'm gonna be working into f3
sour diesels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, hopefully, you know and a lot of
the the back crosses a lot of the reports
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff that we've grown out a lot of it
is, you know, like the old times Sour,
[SPEAKER_00]: so, you know, it's gonna be really just
you know trying to sift through You know
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those genetics and trying to find,
you know, the perfect sour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean Yeah, we've you know grown some
of it out in the in the warehouse and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're excited with you know, one of the
phenols that we found that were super
[SPEAKER_00]: soury and So I think you know from the
reports that we've been getting from the
[SPEAKER_00]: back cross threes Have been all just
really good people excited saying that the
[SPEAKER_01]: sours back That's really exciting to hear
I mean out of all the sour cuts that are
[SPEAKER_01]: in circulation at the moment Which one do
you put sort of your weight behind in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of the one you like the most?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well to me, I mean they're all the same I
mean everyone says well, you know this
[SPEAKER_00]: choco and Rez and this one and that one
and and really, you know back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: There was only one, you know when I when I
first got the sour diesel I got it from
[SPEAKER_00]: AJ's girlfriend That was the only cutting
that they had, you know, and so that was
[SPEAKER_00]: the original, you know and how that's you
know, you know become all these different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of phenos that people claim Is
probably because of genetic drift,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and how people maintain their
mother and their cuttings over the years
[SPEAKER_00]: so You know there, you know If I have a
cutting and you have a cutting and both of
[SPEAKER_00]: us You're growing organics and I'm using
salts and we're just going from clone to
[SPEAKER_00]: clone to clone to clone You know after 10
or 20 years You know my sour could be
[SPEAKER_00]: different than your sour a little bit,
you know, even though the genetics You
[SPEAKER_00]: know are different or the same,
you know, there could be certain qualities
[SPEAKER_00]: that Had evolved to the conditions that it
was growing in over the years and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: one thing I think cannabis does it it
evolves so if you have it in, you know In
[SPEAKER_00]: a shitty fucking condition over a long
period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think is gonna happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so Yeah, I think it's probably
only more recently people are starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: realize how detrimental it is to have
those subpar conditions for the mothers
[SPEAKER_01]: something I was interested to ask you
about is There's a lot of notable strains
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout history that come from sort of
kembag seed that were maybe lost like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know earlier on in the episode you
referenced The original guava things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made me wonder were there any other
genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know over say the 90s or the early
2000s where you really like them and they
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't chem genetics But maybe they got
lost and they just sort of don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned because the chem tends to take
the limelight Yeah, well I specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: remember in a hash plant That my friend
used to get and that was from an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grower And we used to call the guy whose
name was Dave Dave Lincoln and he used to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a Lincoln beard So that's why I used
to call Dave Lincoln and my friend met him
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Staten Island Hydro store He was in
there shopping one day and this guy other
[SPEAKER_00]: guy odd character was in there and they
just you know Started a conversation and
[SPEAKER_00]: hit it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this guy was going back and forth
to Amsterdam and had gotten some hash
[SPEAKER_00]: plant seeds and I specifically remember
this stuff because the shit used to blow
[SPEAKER_00]: me away and it used to You know leave the
room and you know almost in a light
[SPEAKER_00]: perfume me kind of pungent smell to almost
like a haze like smell to it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I remember this stuff was just you
know, super potent and I Know that AJ he
[SPEAKER_00]: was able to get some early on and Yeah,
unfortunately the guy Dave He wound up
[SPEAKER_00]: going on vacation somewhere and left some
drunk to You know to take care of his
[SPEAKER_00]: place and so the guy somehow or another
winds up locking himself up Out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: apartment and is like banging on the door
The neighbors called the super and the
[SPEAKER_00]: police They opened the door and as soon as
you open the door, it was just like BAM
[SPEAKER_00]: you walked into his room, I guess and so
Unfortunately, yeah that hash plant wound
[SPEAKER_00]: up, you know Coming to an end and I never
you know wound up seeing anything quite
[SPEAKER_00]: like that ever again You know,
I could only assume that those Genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: were probably coming from Neville,
you know because we're talking Probably
[SPEAKER_00]: the late late 80s early 90s So,
you know, I would assume that those no
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics came from Neville But yeah,
that was one specific strain that I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember back in the day and there was
like a couple you know stuff that they
[SPEAKER_00]: used to call Kush and Northern lights and
those two things were very Kind of and
[SPEAKER_00]: when you say Kush, I'm not talking og
Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different type of Kush and not
Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Yeah, I mean, I can't really remember
exactly what you know that could I just
[SPEAKER_00]: remember it was like super crystal II and
this this bomb and You know, I also
[SPEAKER_00]: remember some northern lights that used to
be around that was kind of medicine II and
[SPEAKER_00]: pine II and Yeah, so I mean, yeah,
there were some really good strains that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know used to be around back in the day
and some really good tie I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: getting this tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We that was just unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called the The Golden Eagle tie and
The thing about the Golden Eagle time my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend in Times Square wound up getting it
and they used to come in kilos and the
[SPEAKER_00]: kilos were wrapped in cellophane and so
the brick was wrapped up and then they had
[SPEAKER_00]: a stamp on of a Golden Eagle and The funny
thing about the story is you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff only came around once there was back
in 89 I specifically remember it because I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember getting some of it and taking it
to the Grateful Dead show and it was a it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a memorable run and We I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a bunch of people there and my
friend had a van and we had I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: like three or four cars I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like eight or ten people hanging
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting ready to go into the show
And I had this fucking tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We this Golden Eagle tie We'd I rolled up
two joints and I lit them both up at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time and we're all in a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm smoking on two joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I passed one one way and the other one the
other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we you know we smoked we smoked those
two joints and there was a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: there and so I figured oh you know maybe
you know everyone didn't get high enough
[SPEAKER_00]: so we smoked those two joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wound up packing a bowl and like
everyone just dropped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you know when I've had everyone
like no everyone just fucking bailed you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and I just specifically remember that
and I just remember man this shit must be
[SPEAKER_00]: really good you know so you know that that
I remember and I remember getting big huge
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds in it to that really big seeds and
eventually I lost them to the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway the funny thing about the story
is that there's a book out called Tice
[SPEAKER_00]: Tice stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I kind of became friendly with the
author and one of what someone that that I
[SPEAKER_00]: know someone that my friend knows a mutual
friend they see those stamps of the Golden
[SPEAKER_00]: Eagle and they framed them in a picture
frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they took a picture of it and he sent
it to me and I recognized it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I made a post.
[SPEAKER_00]: I posted that Golden Eagle stamp and that
the author of the tie stick book
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized that stamp and actually knew of
that particular load and knew of that
[SPEAKER_00]: particular load that that came to they
were they were coming they were those
[SPEAKER_00]: stamps were coming from you know a
particular group of people and which he
[SPEAKER_00]: documents in that book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah and actually he has a picture of
I think it was in one of the newspapers
[SPEAKER_00]: they had busted part of that load or
something but they have a picture of that
[SPEAKER_00]: load of the eagle stamp in there and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah that was like our real amazing
thing that kind of came.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another amazing thing that came full
circle of was actually being able to track
[SPEAKER_00]: track and he actually knows the actual
person that you know he tells a story the
[SPEAKER_00]: guy went up into Laos into this farm and
you know started a farm you know you know
[SPEAKER_00]: they these guys were smuggling you know
the tie back back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I mean they instead of buying it
from people they actually started their
[SPEAKER_00]: own farm that's how deep they started
getting into it you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know if you really get if you if
you get into the book tie stick yeah it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all documented.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean that was an amazing thing I
thought that you know which wound up you
[SPEAKER_00]: know coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really the really the Internet has
really been an intricate part of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The evolve you know evolving everything
and putting you know being able to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out these stories of the tie and the chem
dog and you know you know being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate with someone around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know when it first came out really
gave us the ability to someone in New York
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk to someone in California and
actually like the concept of mailing
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in all of that it you know you know
like like if you really think about it
[SPEAKER_00]: like you you know like how is that going
to work that you're going to mail me
[SPEAKER_00]: something in the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like so you know all of that was just
you know very new and and fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah you know it was just amazing and
really you know I know I'm I'm a product
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know if it wasn't for the Internet you
know I wouldn't be who I you know and the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that that helped me I wouldn't be
who I am you know because how else are
[SPEAKER_00]: people going to know about you find out
about you or you know or even connect with
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the beginning it was never really
about being trying to be about trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: be someone in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just trying to trying to make your
hustle and trying to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: To pay your bills and feed your family and
so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know in the very beginning you know
no one was ever you know trying to be you
[SPEAKER_00]: know some kind of big kind of a breeder or
you know we just kind of evolved into
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know we were just hustlers you
know from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of being in the right place at the
right time and just taking advantage of
[SPEAKER_00]: the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and merely having the balls to
really do something that was illegal you
[SPEAKER_00]: know at the time where people now you know
it's pretty easy for anyone to you know to
[SPEAKER_00]: jump in and you know become an Instagram
seed breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I mean I've been reflecting on that
point myself a lot recently that like any
[SPEAKER_01]: perceived struggles people have these
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably quite minimal compared to what
you know yourself and some of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of original guys really had to go up
against.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know kudos for taking the risk at a
time when you know the punishments were
[SPEAKER_01]: arguably incredibly worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to just link back though when you
were talking about the hash plant that was
[SPEAKER_01]: lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brought to mind I'm wondering what
what's your thoughts on the Skelly hash
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's it's often a really well
received cutting among the chem heads and
[SPEAKER_01]: as a sort of a follow up to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think there's a link between Skelly
and the Chem 91?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean I think the hash plant itself it's
kind of greasy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know there's no chem in it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a raw Afghani type of plant
very similar to other hash plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash plant number one being one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's a I mean it's an old it's a
very old cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very tricky to to dial in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't clone very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah it's you know it's I mean just
describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know I would describe it as now
as a heavy Afghan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know which can be kind of bland to
some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know because there's not a lot of you
know a lot of flavor and there's more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: dankness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know so I don't I don't really see a
real you know between the two of them it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a night and day because that the
the hash the Skelly grows really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: short and bushy and you know kind of like
a typical hash plant Afghan land-raised
[SPEAKER_00]: type of a plant where the chems are you
know a little more stretchy and more terpy
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah I mean I can kind of see there is
a little bit of a similar similar you know
[SPEAKER_00]: they have similar traits to them but a lot
different where I would describe the
[SPEAKER_00]: Skelly as probably a pure indigo and the
chems kind of more of a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid sativa they just have that little
bit more sativa hybrid to them it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: and growth and and structure and
everything too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah certainly I've I've had similar
thoughts myself you know about I guess to
[SPEAKER_01]: me the Skelly hash plant has some similar
taste to the chem dog but as you said
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just sort of an Afghani taste I
guess doesn't really explain why there's
[SPEAKER_01]: such a dramatic difference in the way they
grow and whatnot but sort of I guess at
[SPEAKER_01]: the heart of the question is like what do
you think are the genetics in the chem dog
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's a bit of a follow-up I
remember I spoke to Peabud years ago and
[SPEAKER_01]: and he said you know like look Joe Brands
the only one who probably really can give
[SPEAKER_01]: you any more information than what already
exists do you think we'll ever get that
[SPEAKER_01]: information from Joe or someone?
[SPEAKER_00]: No I mean I don't think no one really
knows you know I mean I suspect it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: to be you know obviously some time some
type of Afghan I mean just by you know by
[SPEAKER_00]: the the chem 91 just by the dark the dark
leaves you know which is kind of similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Skelly you know they get that
really kind of darkness to them the shiny
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness to them so there's definitely
some you know Afghan influence in there
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I'm hearing you know I've heard
some rumors of the dog bud being in Oregon
[SPEAKER_00]: in the dead family I'm trying to get some
some more information on that but that was
[SPEAKER_00]: from an outside source I mean the the
rumors all go back to that same area of
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon and in Washington you know so I you
know I have to believe it probably came
[SPEAKER_00]: out it definitely came out of there it
could be some type of northern lights
[SPEAKER_00]: thing but you know that you know I would
like you know if and I'm sure you know
[SPEAKER_00]: guys like Greg McAllister and some are
older head and older heads than me can
[SPEAKER_00]: probably answer this question of plants
that were fuely you know that chemi
[SPEAKER_00]: fueliness now I don't know if that was
ever a trait of any of the NL tree and NL
[SPEAKER_00]: strains or any of the Afghans that these
guys got back in the day but there's got
[SPEAKER_00]: to be someone that's out there that could
recognize I mean I mean that that that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know diesel chemi whatever you want to
call it you know that's a specific turp
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and so I mean I'd have to think
it's got to come out of the some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghans or Kush's you know from from from
those regions of hash make so I mean you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and you'd really would have to go
back to some of those regions and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean do you know do these turps still
you know survive in their original form
[SPEAKER_00]: was it something that was was crossed you
know into a sativa type of a plant or you
[SPEAKER_00]: know there's a lot of different you know a
lot of different questions because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the chemists off is quite complex
you know and then you know if you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the 91 the way that it grows you know very
similar to an og crush you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: you know there you know a lot of people
like me think that they're they're
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely related in some form or another
just by the way that you know that it
[SPEAKER_00]: grows but bud structure the fueliness you
know obviously there's you know a turp
[SPEAKER_00]: difference and there must have been
something that was something different
[SPEAKER_00]: that was brought in so so really you know
really getting back to you know the origin
[SPEAKER_00]: of that fueliness where does that
originate from and I don't think anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: could really answer that question yeah it
may well be one for the ages as sort of a
[SPEAKER_01]: follow-up to that question did you ever
have any sort of relationship with Joe
[SPEAKER_00]: Brand and did you ever see the him one two
or three I never personally met Joe we had
[SPEAKER_00]: many conversations over the years online
we were always one step away from meeting
[SPEAKER_00]: but couldn't for whatever reason I met P
bud first before I met Joe you know
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately Joe you know fell off over
the years due to a bad drug habit you know
[SPEAKER_00]: me P bud Greg you know lots of other
people have always kind of you know
[SPEAKER_00]: reached out and you know tried to help him
and you know he I mean he really could
[SPEAKER_00]: have been someone in the industry but
unfortunately chose a different path he
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely has a place in history and has
a story to tell but unfortunately other
[SPEAKER_00]: other demons or you know or winning the
fight and so you know we haven't you know
[SPEAKER_00]: heard from Joe in you know in a few years
so I don't know if he's still with us or
[SPEAKER_00]: not I mean he could possibly on the last
time I reached out to someone that had
[SPEAKER_00]: tabs on him they couldn't locate him so
yeah we don't know the status of Joe and
[SPEAKER_00]: we you know we you know we hope and pray
that you know he could you know get his
[SPEAKER_00]: shit together and you know there's there's
there's always a place in history and a
[SPEAKER_00]: new beginning for him if he wants but you
know these are things that you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: we we can't control other people's actions
unfortunately you can only go forward with
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves so yeah that's you know that's
pretty much it on him yeah no that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a good response that's a good
response so on a recent episode we had mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob Hemphill on and we're sort of talking
about the hash plant 13 and I know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've had a little bit of experience with
that one and I was wondering if you had
[SPEAKER_01]: any sort of insights you'd be willing to
share with us because there's such little
[SPEAKER_00]: information about it out there yeah well
the hash plant 13 yeah I mean I recently I
[SPEAKER_00]: unraveled the mystery behind that you know
I had purchased some land-raised seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: from someone and when I grew them out it
was just that that that salty onion garlic
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk that's unmistakable to HP 13 and
when I smelled it I was like that's it you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and so I had been searching for that
strain for quite some time because it was
[SPEAKER_00]: always a mythical strain that was around
New York City at the same time that the
[SPEAKER_00]: hash plant was but I never ever got to
sample it but I always heard about it so
[SPEAKER_00]: you know when I saw you know and over the
years I saw multiple breeders offer that
[SPEAKER_00]: strain but it never you know I well I grew
it out from two different people and the
[SPEAKER_00]: first person I grew it out from it was not
you know anything that I really thought
[SPEAKER_00]: was worth keeping and then when I grew out
the second breeders pack that's when I
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when I found the real deal and
recently I was at the New York City gene
[SPEAKER_00]: trader show and you know that's you know
my that's my stopping grounds New York so
[SPEAKER_00]: when I went home when I went to that was
like it was like it was like a homecoming
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of my old friends came out a lot of
my old customers a lot of people I you
[SPEAKER_00]: know worked with you know and so a friend
of mine came out you know that I had known
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time and introduced me to the
breeder of the HP 13 Eddie this guy named
[SPEAKER_00]: Eddie Eddie originally was from New York
wasn't in New York City seen in the 90s he
[SPEAKER_00]: create he was a grower he created HP 13
and then he moved to Maui in Hawaii so
[SPEAKER_00]: when he moved out there was a whole bunch
of people from from New York at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: that moved out moved out to Hawaii and
they there was a whole whole scene that
[SPEAKER_00]: that that started out there and that's
kind of where the that's how the HP 13
[SPEAKER_00]: wound up being in Hawaii because those
guys brought brought it over there and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how some of those other guys got a
hold of it out there so so yeah I mean I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean when I when I you know I got the
original HP 13 as a cutting it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit tired and and it always you
know it always you know when it was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it always had that really you know
really the turps were just amazing when
[SPEAKER_00]: you smell it just very very very unique
you know but it was a hard grow it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: hard plant to grow and it always it was a
bug and if you had any kind of bugs in
[SPEAKER_00]: your in your grow they would just you know
for some reason it was you know just one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those plants that the you know the
mites would just they would be on the HP
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 but the plant next to it they wouldn't
be on so it was just one of those type of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants where the bugs just loved it and
yeah I mean over the years it kind of it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of lost some of its vigor and some of
the turps and stuff it had gotten tired
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years and so yeah the original
cutting you know I wound up doing some
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding with it and then I just
eventually I unfortunately lost it but the
[SPEAKER_00]: the special thing about it was just turps
about it and you know a lot of people used
[SPEAKER_00]: to you know used to say the same exact
thing that they're saying about the sour
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that they say about the hash
plant you know that early on it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: strong and really turpy this and that now
it's kind of weak and we got you know we
[SPEAKER_00]: we've crossed the board so you know when I
when I picked it up you know you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: brought it back to a BX1 and you know then
kind of just it kind of just fell off from
[SPEAKER_00]: there you know I have all that original
stock but you know when I found you know
[SPEAKER_00]: the original mother plant you know I was
really excited and so I'm hoping you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna be doing some breeding with that
real soon actually I mean I got it right
[SPEAKER_00]: now and unfortunately I had a HP 13 back
cross I popped some seeds and a few plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wound up getting they were all
female so like sometimes you pop seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: with the hope to finding a male and
they'll come out female and yeah that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a little disappointing for me but
unfortunately for me I have some pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: stored away so I'm gonna I have some UW
back cross pollen and that was the UW you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that was the original cross was
double dog HP one puck times the UW and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I back crossed the UW twice and so
the UW hash plant kind of has it it's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost a little similar to the HP 13 and
probably similar to the hash plant that I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember back in the day because it kind
of has like a very distinctive kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: pissy skunky like it's really hard to
describe rod but when you smoke it it's
[SPEAKER_00]: got that pungent kind of smell kind of
like when you smoked above a kush when you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked above a kush you know it does leave
a spiciness in the air so there's there is
[SPEAKER_00]: you know some of these hash plant kush is
out there like that's got this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: spiciness to it you know which is very
unique in indigo because you don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: find that like spicy like kind of pungent
haze hazy type of smell you know in indigo
[SPEAKER_00]: so I find those ones really interesting
yeah definitely definitely it sounds like
[SPEAKER_01]: a killer I might be confused here but one
of our listeners was wondering because it
[SPEAKER_01]: might might be the same plant we're
talking about but hopefully you can
[SPEAKER_01]: clarify for me they were just wondering
how you would describe the hash plant
[SPEAKER_01]: slash puck slash double dog mother you
used in the HP 91 cross you made is that
[SPEAKER_00]: the same plan or is it different and how
would you describe it yeah yeah no it was
[SPEAKER_00]: more kind of puckish you know kind of you
know more more indigo yeah all that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of just kind of lean toward the puck
because it was you know the HP one you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and the puck were kind of like very
similar plants there's very kind of short
[SPEAKER_00]: short indigos kind of leafy single cola
you know fat nugs kind of blandish and and
[SPEAKER_00]: taste and and and turps more of a you know
heavy stony indigo type of a plant yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: nice great I was gonna say I used to have
this cutting I got from your seeds that I
[SPEAKER_01]: miss so much it was from the skunk OG did
you ever hear much back from customers
[SPEAKER_00]: about that I had this killer cut I loved
it yeah yeah I mean we got a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback but it wasn't something that
really gained a lot of traction it's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of funny how sometimes those things work
out you know sometimes you only take
[SPEAKER_00]: someone one person like you to find
something like that and then start blowing
[SPEAKER_00]: it up and then it just starts creates a
lot of interest and and that's kind of how
[SPEAKER_00]: those things work like you know that the
only way I can describe it is they kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: take a life of their own like I could say
what I want about how good they are but
[SPEAKER_00]: until they get into somebody else's hands
and and and and especially if it's someone
[SPEAKER_00]: that has any kind of influence or
following and if they start blowing it up
[SPEAKER_00]: and just that's the only way that I can
describe like my whole the way everything
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of evolved for me it wasn't really
what I did with everything is what
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone else did with my genetics you
know and I made them but you know other
[SPEAKER_00]: people actually have made them famous more
famous than I have for me you know I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying people have gone out and won awards
with them people have you know you know
[SPEAKER_00]: when something's that good it just kind of
stands out and it takes a life of its own
[SPEAKER_00]: so you know like I said it doesn't really
matter what I think or say about it it's
[SPEAKER_00]: what you say and what everyone else thinks
and says you know and when I show you
[SPEAKER_00]: something that good you're gonna be like
wow that's amazing you know what I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: and you show your buddy and then it just
you know before you just takes it that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the only way I can describe it's you know
yeah no I totally agree with you again I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess people may be a bit apprehensive if
her breeders telling you you know this is
[SPEAKER_01]: the bees knees like maybe maybe they've
been sold something that wasn't very good
[SPEAKER_01]: before in the past so yeah when someone
else blows it up it's like hey this is
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no reason for me to say it's good
if it's not but that's interesting to hear
[SPEAKER_01]: and another thing I was thinking about
earlier today was your star cookies cross
[SPEAKER_01]: it was sort of like the original GMO right
because like you know stardogs like a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of Chem D in it right and then it's
crossed to the forum because it's sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: like its own GMO in a way before GMO was
big did you ever find any Finos like GMO
[SPEAKER_00]: in there or sort of a bit different no not
really like that really like the GMO is
[SPEAKER_00]: just I don't know it's just kind of like
an anomaly it just it's I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been able to find anything the
same cutting you know I'm sure it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: remade and it's just like it's you know
it's just one of those things that one in
[SPEAKER_00]: a thousand seed or whatever whatever it
was they can't they can't duplicate that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know so and that was really because
you know it was very Chem D heavy you know
[SPEAKER_00]: when you smell you know when you smell you
know GMO you just get like full garlic
[SPEAKER_00]: fuel you know yeah so I mean the blend of
that was just kind of an amazing thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: really I don't think that they can
duplicate it I mean I forget the name who
[SPEAKER_00]: made what was the name I think it was
Mamako seeds Mamako okay yeah right and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that he's remade him I know that he's
remade him so I don't hear anyone you know
[SPEAKER_00]: finding that and I kind of kind of look at
the same thing as the motor breath you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the motor breath was SFB OG times
Chem D and so when you when you get a bag
[SPEAKER_00]: of that stuff and you smell the motor
breath it smells heavy Chem D I mean you
[SPEAKER_00]: know but when you smoke it it tastes like
OG you know so it's just one of them
[SPEAKER_00]: things where you know the genetics just
you know fell into place and it was a you
[SPEAKER_00]: know winning ticket but to try to recreate
that I mean I think you're probably better
[SPEAKER_00]: off breeding with that to recreate it then
to try to use the original parents because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's gonna be so much diversity in the
gene pool and you probably got to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through who knows how many seeds to find
that you know it is in there but how you
[SPEAKER_00]: know often is it gonna pop up you know
that one in ten one who knows it and if
[SPEAKER_00]: other people aren't finding it you know
then that must tell you that it's it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: rare it's a rare thing so yeah yeah hugely
hugely I think I can't remember who was
[SPEAKER_01]: but someone came on the show a while back
and said oh you know GMO it's just it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just Chem D dressed up like cookies and it
made me think like sounds kind of true to
[SPEAKER_01]: me but I guess it sort of made me start
thinking about how it's funny that you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to dress the Chem D up like cookies
for people to be more interested like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a weird concept because for people
like you know in the real Chem die hard
[SPEAKER_01]: fandom like they you know you don't need
to sell them on Chem D but the sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: newer generation needs it to look like
cookies to be able to really get into it
[SPEAKER_00]: well you know to me and I grew the GMO and
a Chem D in a warehouse in production I
[SPEAKER_00]: both got both of them tested and actually
the GMO test higher than a Chem D if you
[SPEAKER_00]: could believe it the GMO was in 28 you
know the Chem D was maybe like 25 and I
[SPEAKER_00]: could take you know both of those buds
side by side and I could smoke that GMO
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when I smoke that Chem D it would
just rip apart you know the GMO you know
[SPEAKER_00]: the GMO has a little bit more the cookies
a little bit more sativa so it's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more of an upper and up to it
you know where the Chem D I mean just I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that shit just rips right through you
I mean there's no up to it it will just
[SPEAKER_00]: devastate you so even though the Chem D
was tested lower than a GMO it smoked way
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger you know it was for me the GMO is
nice it could be a little unsatisfying for
[SPEAKER_00]: me at times because of the sativa tip to
it the same could be said to the Chem
[SPEAKER_00]: Sister and the Chem Sister is a very
garlic key onion very Chem D turps same
[SPEAKER_00]: exact thing but it's more on a sativa and
tip to it and so it does not give you that
[SPEAKER_00]: devastating high I would describe it more
kind of like the GMO is a little bit upper
[SPEAKER_00]: more sativa so that's why like the gym I
mean the Chem Sister has never really been
[SPEAKER_00]: a real popular you know popular thing and
then you know getting back you had asked
[SPEAKER_00]: me about the Chem one two three and four
and yeah I grew the Chem one from an
[SPEAKER_00]: inspector it grew it grew very no yeah
yeah for me I don't know some people said
[SPEAKER_00]: it was nl5 haze a little bit like I don't
know to me it was like kind of blandish
[SPEAKER_00]: like I didn't really I didn't really see
anything special about it I didn't I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't catch any I don't know I I bred to
it a couple times and lost it but like I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean to me it wasn't even like smokable
head stash for me I thought you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: two was a little bit more was a little bit
nicer and but still nothing real special
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it's kind of weird because as you
know as you get to the three and I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: the three was probably better than the one
in the two and then and the three was very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to the four and but grew shorter
and was a little more shit citrusy I would
[SPEAKER_00]: say and but it wasn't really it wasn't
really a strong smoker it was nice you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I mean and then you had the four so
really out of all of them I thought the
[SPEAKER_00]: you know the four was really the best one
out of them all overall smoke best yielded
[SPEAKER_00]: best grew the best and everything so
that's really what the reason why really
[SPEAKER_00]: the one two and three aren't really
relevant because you know they just never
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I don't know there's never was
really that good and you know when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about you know having you know
number of different plants you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: and the space that you have and everything
so you know a lot of that you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: take into account where you know just
doesn't you know just doesn't make it you
[SPEAKER_00]: know he just gets it gets cold out and you
know you move on to something else that's
[SPEAKER_00]: better so but yeah the the three and the
four were definitely the the standouts out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the one two three four the two you know
was better than the one the you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: both of them all of them were kind of
really more heavy indigo more uh yeah even
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know I'm trying to think you know
okay and and a lot different too from the
[SPEAKER_00]: the 91 the the D and a sister you know
where you know it's kind of weird because
[SPEAKER_00]: you got like the 91 which you know is
fuely and skunky but not it's not real
[SPEAKER_00]: super terpy you know it's more kind of got
that blandish afghan tip to it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: with the darker leaves and the dark yeah
you know even the even the fan leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff you know the sugar leaves are darker
and everything and then you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: compare that to the the the you know the
skunky uh garlic oniony uh of the of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem D and a sister and then you kind of
get into the more piney chemi um you know
[SPEAKER_00]: little little you know like a little
citrusy on on the you know the three and
[SPEAKER_00]: the four and stuff so uh yeah it's just
interesting that you know the the
[SPEAKER_00]: different uh profiles that that that came
out of that whole line yeah definitely I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean there's a lot there's a lot of stuff
sort of locking in there isn't there what
[SPEAKER_01]: you just said made me think of something
which you know never popped to mind before
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'd love to know if you knew anything
on it which is there's another guy out
[SPEAKER_01]: there relatively unknown breeder named
incognito and he breeds with like chem one
[SPEAKER_01]: two three and four I think it's legit yeah
do you know who he is or how he ties into
[SPEAKER_00]: it yes yes yes yeah now we we know who he
is uh you know we we we had a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a disagreement uh you know some some
years back and you know we don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: talk but I know that that money mike was
friends with him and he did have and gave
[SPEAKER_00]: him the chem three so I know that his chem
three is legitimate now I can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: speak on his one or two uh chem cuts um I
know that he had you know he's up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts and I know that he you know
had friends who were friends with you know
[SPEAKER_00]: uh I think some of the chem family so he's
been able to uh you know source uh those
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics through those people but uh as
far as I know he does have you know
[SPEAKER_01]: legitimate uh chem genetics ah that's cool
to hear that's cool to hear um in your in
[SPEAKER_01]: your prior answer you referenced you know
like some of them weren't really what
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd call head stash and it sort of made
me wonder what to you qualifies as head
[SPEAKER_01]: stash given you've got such a superb sort
of foundation of like what's good weed to
[SPEAKER_01]: you and what's not what are the sorts of
things that would make something fall into
[SPEAKER_00]: the head stash category for you well you
know it's you know it's hard to say but
[SPEAKER_00]: you know like when I go you know for head
stash I'm looking for you know something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know I'm looking for fuel I'm
looking for you know chem or og or sour
[SPEAKER_00]: you know diesel you know I need something
I need something that's you know that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna you know that's gonna get me high um
but you know I'm I'm a connoisseur so I
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know all different you know sides
of the spectrum so you know I like a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good haze also you know and so you
know and what really makes it for me is
[SPEAKER_00]: when I take a hit off a joint or off a
bowl or bong or whatever and I take a
[SPEAKER_00]: really big hit and I hold it and you know
you get that long expansion you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: you blow that you blow that hit out and as
you're blowing that hit out you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: now all of a sudden you you know you start
to get the head rush you start to feel the
[SPEAKER_00]: effects of of that now and I'm just
talking about one hit you know and even
[SPEAKER_00]: like with a good haze like I could take a
hit off of a really good haze and and and
[SPEAKER_00]: just close my eyes and blow it out and
then feel the effects of the third eye and
[SPEAKER_00]: the headband and just the different you
know effects that you feel inside your
[SPEAKER_00]: head you know and you just get you know a
feeling of a warm fuzzy blanket that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's put over you you know that's how
the chem makes me feel you know so you
[SPEAKER_00]: know there's a lot of different strains
that are gonna give you different effects
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know in the end for me you know I
want to be able to take one big hit and
[SPEAKER_00]: blow it out and then be able to be like
whoa that's you know that's something and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not a lot of strains that can
really you know that really you know hold
[SPEAKER_00]: up to that test you know so you know you
know I'm willing to you know try anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that anything that's good but you know in
in today's you know today's world there's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a lot that you know that you know that
that that cut it and most of the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that does is really closely related you
know the chems the OGs the sours the hazes
[SPEAKER_00]: you know there's not a lot of different
diversity out there sort of speak you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and it depends on what you're you know
smoking for you know I describe what I
[SPEAKER_00]: what I smoke for some people are just
about the flavor you know I'm not one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys that just take a hit and blows
it out quick and you know enjoys the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor of it you know like I said when I
take a big hit I'm gonna hold that I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to feel that lugging lug lung expansion
and then I want to you know blow out a
[SPEAKER_00]: cloud that's gonna make me cough and make
and make my head you know to explode yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: brilliant it's funny as you were saying
that it made me start thinking that
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling you describe you know like you
take the heat you hold it and the feeling
[SPEAKER_01]: comes over you and the third eye it's
almost it's almost like a human experience
[SPEAKER_01]: for good weed across the board isn't it
it's funny well sometimes you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: then sometimes you know you know you feel
that not just with the head but with the
[SPEAKER_00]: really good stuff you get the full body
effect so you know I mean the warm fuzzy
[SPEAKER_00]: blanket that's what I describe it as so is
it you know and some strains will just get
[SPEAKER_00]: that strictly head-high where you're just
getting that but you know so you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really the difference between you
know indigo and sativa and for me it has
[SPEAKER_00]: to do with you know the burning of the
cannabinoids in the vegetative matter
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't get those same effects
with hash or any kind of concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: there's something with the vegetative
matter the burning of the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: matter that just the combustion of those
cannabinoids just there's just something
[SPEAKER_00]: special about flower for me the effect
that I just don't get that with hash or
[SPEAKER_01]: any type of concentrate yeah here I can
agree to that so I just want to quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: take us back to talk about the ChemD for a
moment because you were talking about it
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier and you were referencing the
ChemSys and a few other cuts and I guess
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm wondering is what's your take on
the situation given there's so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different ChemD cuts going around you know
I think I've seen like three or four
[SPEAKER_01]: different ones now and you know there's
the original one and the variegated one
[SPEAKER_01]: and the ChemSys and the ChemDS one from
Bundy and all that where do you how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: lay out the Chem is there one ChemD in
your mind that's the real one or how do
[SPEAKER_00]: you view the situation well there's only
been one real one now it's a variegated
[SPEAKER_00]: one and and I think what's what what
what's happened a lot is a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: are mistaking the ChemSister as the ChemD
and then yeah and then you get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bundy thing and you know maybe some other
s1s that could come into play I could just
[SPEAKER_00]: you know speak from personal experience
that we back you know and back in a day
[SPEAKER_00]: popped a ChemD s1 and it was very very
close to the original but a little sweeter
[SPEAKER_00]: we called it ChemD 3 or something like
that we had that around for a little while
[SPEAKER_00]: but we we let that go eventually but so
really my point is is really like you know
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone can really find that type of pheno
in in an s1 you know in a ChemDog seed
[SPEAKER_00]: ChemD seed so you know depending on the
situation you know if it's self-hermed or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever so yeah I mean so all of that
kind of muddies the water a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: so unless you unless you know unless you
don't know what the original is you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to know and yeah it is some type of
ChemDog or whatever but yeah the other you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the the original D you know grows a
certain way it grows kind of medium to
[SPEAKER_00]: short it's not really stretchy and Sativa
like like the like the 91 grows and the
[SPEAKER_00]: sister so yeah so you know it's really
trying to really know the real
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics of you know of the real
thing and compared to what you have so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's you know kind of hard to say you know
the same thing with you know with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the strains now the OGs the sours and now
it's starting with the chems where you
[SPEAKER_00]: know there's just so many different names
and a lot of them are the same thing but
[SPEAKER_01]: just mislabeled yeah hugely hugely it made
me wonder a lot of people these days have
[SPEAKER_01]: been running a lot of s1s of both the 91
and the D and I think it's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're now sort of more available
to people but a lot of cool phenos popping
[SPEAKER_01]: their heads out and as you've referenced a
few times now some sort of more fruity
[SPEAKER_01]: ones coming out of those seeds which to me
was quite surprising you know I guess I
[SPEAKER_01]: never really thought there was a lot of
fruitiness inside the chem have you ever
[SPEAKER_01]: popped any bag seeds or s1s and found
something like just really that blew you
[SPEAKER_01]: away where you were like I did not expect
to find this in these seeds yeah actually
[SPEAKER_00]: we find kind of like a maple and there's
like a maple type of pheno that comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: of some of the star dog stuff and I've
seen some of it come out of some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem D stuff too and it's more of an
astringent kind of an Afghan I you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: would think but you know that turf is very
distinguishable and yeah it does come out
[SPEAKER_00]: on the maple stuff but the fruity stuff we
haven't you know I have haven't really
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten no not much fruit out of the chems
out of the stuff that you know that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: run yeah yeah the more than that maple the
maple stuff is you know and like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more of a real kind of an Afghan I
feel type of a turf yeah that's so very
[SPEAKER_01]: very interesting I guess you know time
will tell and I think I should maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: clarify when I say fruity I think the
reports I had read were sort of like maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of near that guava end of things like
sort of a what did they say like
[SPEAKER_01]: grapefruit so I guess like you know a bit
of bitterness slash not like the most yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: well we found some kind of little citrus
like I like I said we found a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of citrus there was a little bit of citrus
in the threes so you know I would think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's probably what you know they were
referring that you're referring to is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like a little citrusiness yeah that
explains it perfectly there's been one
[SPEAKER_01]: question that I've been wanting to ask you
for like six or seven years now because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just so conflicting all over the
internet but basically I was wondering if
[SPEAKER_01]: you could give us the backstory on the Day
Wrecker because everything I had read
[SPEAKER_01]: about it said that it was basically gone
but you still see people saying you know
[SPEAKER_01]: I've crossed this to the Day Wrecker and
I'm like isn't it gone well you know
[SPEAKER_00]: referring back to my original post on the
internet on overgrow I had referred to the
[SPEAKER_00]: chem 91 you know as the original diesel
which was you know it was called the
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel originally you know that you know
so we never called it original diesel it
[SPEAKER_00]: was just called diesel people like you
know you got that diesel shit you know so
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that's how that really first came
about you know and and really the the
[SPEAKER_00]: underdog you know and so I had which we
had referenced previously you know people
[SPEAKER_00]: would be like yeah that you know the
underdog which was the super skunk and now
[SPEAKER_00]: times 91 and people used to refer to that
as the Day Wrecker that'd be like yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: that shit wrecked my day you have more of
that Day Wrecker shit you know so I
[SPEAKER_00]: referenced that as that you know and so
and that and all of these other little
[SPEAKER_00]: names that I had you know the Day Wrecker
and the headband and the headband was
[SPEAKER_00]: another one be like yeah you know that
shit gave me after I smoked I got a
[SPEAKER_00]: headband thing you know like you know
we're talking about the third eye and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot so all of these things were all
reference to the chem so when I made that
[SPEAKER_00]: original post I named all of those all of
those names I named the headband all that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and what happened was that people
just kind of picked up on those catch
[SPEAKER_00]: names on the internet and and being like
you know they might have found some kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of s1 or got some kind of diesel that they
didn't know what it was or whatever and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just came up with oh we'll call it
the headband or we'll call it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: underdog or you know and so like all these
names have kind of been like hijacked from
[SPEAKER_01]: the original yeah I guess it makes sense
you know people just even knowingly or
[SPEAKER_01]: unknowingly is using the inappropriate
names so with that being said then when
[SPEAKER_01]: people talk about original diesel or
diesel and they talk about like you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the DN L and L5 Hayes sort of components
to all that do you think there's maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: less truth to that than what the internet
maybe makes out at times you think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe all just chem or do you think it's
it's just so convoluted it's hard to track
[SPEAKER_00]: at all yeah I don't know it's kind of hard
to tell you know it's yeah I mean because
[SPEAKER_00]: the people have just just changed you know
people just you know because back you know
[SPEAKER_00]: back in those early days like names
weren't really you know as big as they are
[SPEAKER_00]: now yeah I mean so like we just kind of
you know that's kind of like how the PIF
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these other Hayes type of church
and you know these were just all kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the creepy these were all kind of just
catch names you know back in the day you
[SPEAKER_00]: know so you know they weren't really
anything specific you know some things
[SPEAKER_00]: were but like some things were just kind
of like catch names so people just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: just you know they just you know they just
kind of you know someone just made up made
[SPEAKER_00]: you know thought that you know we'll name
it this to sell it you know and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens too is like people would
change the name of the product because
[SPEAKER_00]: they couldn't sell it under the original
name for whatever reason because they were
[SPEAKER_00]: given a clone and they weren't supposed to
get it so they couldn't call it oh gee
[SPEAKER_00]: course they call it had to call it
underdog or you know so that you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the names have been changed for a
lot of different reasons you know so and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of it has to do with just making money
really yeah yeah I can understand that and
[SPEAKER_00]: the other thing is so the other thing is
too like if I if you if you never have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen a certain strain and if you never
seen underdog or or whatever and I and I
[SPEAKER_00]: and I tell you it is this you know you
think you know you got to think it is
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't know the difference and
so you know so you go thinking it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: real deal and now you're spreading that as
gospel and because that's your only thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know and so that's kind of how
these things get started and then then it
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of gets a life of its own and it
kind of just overtakes the original story
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess yeah certainly certainly I mean
yeah that happens with a lot of things
[SPEAKER_01]: right so if we get back to sort of the the
timeline that you were traveling on in
[SPEAKER_01]: your whole journey when you started to
develop you know you referenced earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: that you wanted to make a nail and you
were like well I'm going to use the
[SPEAKER_01]: strongest stuff I have which is the chem
when you started doing all of that was
[SPEAKER_01]: that with the long-term goal of wanting to
breed or was it more of just like a fun
[SPEAKER_00]: project no for me it was just about
preservation because you know I would you
[SPEAKER_00]: know back then it was hard to get clones
so when you got a clone it was you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you lost it you never knew if you
can get it back so you know my theory was
[SPEAKER_00]: well I'm getting all of these clone these
strains I got to try to make some kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: representation and see form for for
preservation you know even if I get like
[SPEAKER_00]: 70 70 to 80 percent of the original of the
original thing I consider that a home run
[SPEAKER_00]: so that was really what you know my
thought process was really just about
[SPEAKER_00]: preservation in case we lost the chem or
the sour or whatever it was at least I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have some type of seed stock to fall back
on and used because otherwise it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: gone completely yeah sure understandable
so at what point did top dog officially
[SPEAKER_00]: become a brand I think well I had been
selling seeds on IC mag but not under the
[SPEAKER_00]: top I'm not sure I I don't know if I yeah
I don't think I really officially made the
[SPEAKER_00]: brand until I crossed over until into THC
farmer you know because because up back to
[SPEAKER_00]: that point you know I had I was selling
some seeds on seed bay that's how I first
[SPEAKER_00]: started selling seeds was on seed bay and
I was just for that was just for seed
[SPEAKER_00]: credit you know they wanted all your
banking information and wanted to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: bank transfer and back then that was just
like are you crazy you know I mean so I
[SPEAKER_00]: was just like all right I'll start selling
seeds and you know we'll see how it goes
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know I'll build up you know some
money some seed credit and I'll just buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole bunch of packs on seed bay you know
that was you know so that's what I did at
[SPEAKER_00]: first so I wound up getting all the all
these different stuff I got you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: forget I had you know like a thousand
dollars worth of you know credit or two
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand something like that and so like
wow this is you know a lot and so um so
[SPEAKER_00]: really what started to happen in over at
the IC mag was that's when rez was really
[SPEAKER_00]: in his prime and you know he was you know
doing his sour crosses and at that time
[SPEAKER_00]: you know he was just he was just rolling
over everyone you know stepping on
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's toes like he wound up getting
the chem D and at first you know he said
[SPEAKER_00]: he wasn't gonna breed with it and then and
then it turned into a charity auction and
[SPEAKER_00]: then he was gonna give give Greg a Rolex
for compensation it just went from one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to another and just evolved into
where he fucked them you know so uh what
[SPEAKER_00]: what was happening was he was making IC
mag and gypsy so much money like you know
[SPEAKER_00]: these I mean these guys are doing drops
and making like 50 grand and a drop and
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 gram I mean doing stupid numbers I
mean and you know when he was you know
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to do all this he was getting
called out I was calling them out other
[SPEAKER_00]: people were calling them out and so I
really reached a point where we became you
[SPEAKER_00]: know detrimental you know a threat and so
they just kind of muted us and they you
[SPEAKER_00]: know wound up deleting us and all of this
stuff and they banned it they wound up
[SPEAKER_00]: banning me and deleted my account so I
went over to THC farmer and that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: the top dog brand was really launched
officially I guess you could say where I
[SPEAKER_00]: was actually getting getting money getting
paid for you know the the seeds that that
[SPEAKER_00]: I was selling you know and you know and
eventually you know logic you know because
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I mean he had everyone over there
he had OG rascal and I mean everyone from
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day because everyone left IC
mag and he you know he had he had everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: over there and he just wound up fucking
everyone you know he fucked me he fucked
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone and uh yeah the guy is just you
know even to this day I think he's just
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the same thing just scamming people
just trying to get new bee breeders on
[SPEAKER_00]: there get trying to get them to send him
seeds and then he never paid and he never
[SPEAKER_00]: pays you and that's basically how it used
to work you'd have to sell your you know
[SPEAKER_00]: send the seeds up front and then they
would sell them and then they would send
[SPEAKER_00]: you the money and so I wound up going to
Spain and getting cash from logic in
[SPEAKER_00]: person one time and yeah and then after
that he just yeah he just fucked me so but
[SPEAKER_00]: by that time uh that's you know kind of
like when you know I guess that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like like the early beginnings of
instagram by that point I believe you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and uh there yeah what an interesting
progression it all took and that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: makes sense to me now because I remembered
being on IC mag and you see some big name
[SPEAKER_01]: people are banned and I'm like how did
this person end up getting banned but I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess it's as you said you know sort of a
bit of shady stuff on the back end of it
[SPEAKER_00]: all yeah well he anyone I mean if you you
know if you wound up calling any you know
[SPEAKER_00]: res out or you know they just saw that saw
that as a threat for them to their money
[SPEAKER_00]: you know because that was their cash cow
so they had to protect him so he went I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean all you know yeah that all kind of
backfired on all of them in the end so
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah interesting stuff what I've always
found interesting is the sort of parallels
[SPEAKER_01]: between yours and res dogs chemd lines how
you both kind of use the afghan male
[SPEAKER_01]: initially obviously he used the hindu kush
you use the afghani number one but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: generally speaking you know sort of from a
similar general area of the world do you
[SPEAKER_01]: think that the afghan one paired better
with the chemd than the hindu kush yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: well he you know I was the first one to to
get the chemd you know and breed with it
[SPEAKER_00]: you know so I I had that you know going
for me you know so you know he had to copy
[SPEAKER_00]: he had to try to copy me somehow but the
the hindu kush that I grew was very leafy
[SPEAKER_00]: it the you know I thought this uh the
plant itself was more in had more uh
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa in it because it was thin leaf it
kind of grew more stretchy and leafy and I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't like the structure of the plant it
was more floppy you know a thinner stemmed
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything and I thought that it
didn't smoke as well either you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: um the afghan kind of had a mediciney kind
of piney tip to it the afghan one and a
[SPEAKER_00]: thicker stem and thicker buds and
everything the bud structure so I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: overall that you know that plant was the
better plant to use yeah certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly and I guess as just a sort of a
general one how do you feel given you know
[SPEAKER_01]: rez has returned to the scene and is
looking slash in the process of releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: new seeds um yeah it's kind of funny
because he's using my afghan I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: african haze you know and you know he had
you know some good things to say about me
[SPEAKER_00]: in the very beginning of his return how he
admired me and cornbread ricky and a few
[SPEAKER_00]: other people but now after I kind of spoke
out uh over a couple of things he kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: you know uh withdraw withdrew those uh you
know those claims but uh yeah I mean you
[SPEAKER_00]: know uh you know the the the paperwork
kind of speaks for itself I think it was
[SPEAKER_00]: sungrown mids that uh that published all
of the court documentation which shows
[SPEAKER_00]: that rez dog was a queen for a day and for
what people if people don't know what that
[SPEAKER_00]: means that means that you get to go in and
spill the beans on every thing that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and none of that stuff will be held
against you just as long as you don't lie
[SPEAKER_00]: about what you're telling so you know they
they had the the scene in goodfellas when
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy goes in and he was queen for a day
and you go in and you you tell them
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and what they hope to do is you
you collaborate the stuff that they know
[SPEAKER_00]: and you tell and then you tell them stuff
that they don't know because you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what they don't what they know and
what they don't know so when you go in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and spill your guts you're basically
going there and telling everything every
[SPEAKER_00]: exact thing that you did and everything
that you know and implicate other people
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on and so forth so that's what that
is and so you know there's people that say
[SPEAKER_00]: that um you know that the the story that I
got was that um Dutch grown was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be bringing a shipment of seeds back to uh
England and got caught in um in
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts at the airport and
supposedly someone ratted them out and the
[SPEAKER_00]: customs was looking for them when they
made you know went through there so uh I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess at that point you know she
supposedly was an an ex uh law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: uh person and I guess that she spilled her
guts and led them back to rez and he
[SPEAKER_00]: spilled his gut you know everyone just
ratted on it rolled on everyone in the end
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know uh so you know the the
paperwork you know clear clearly shows
[SPEAKER_00]: that so um yeah so I mean you know uh you
know it kind of just goes to show you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that people still support him and in this
day and age of Instagram I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's really anything that you can
really say or do and you know then people
[SPEAKER_00]: were still you're still going to get
people that they're going to support you
[SPEAKER_00]: you know so no matter how low you go you
know if you're going to you know if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to copy someone and rip off their
genetics or if you're a known rat or or or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you know I don't know how how low
the bar goes to where you know it reaches
[SPEAKER_00]: the point where people aren't going to
support you so I mean I mean that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that it goes on you know and on
Instagram uh no matter uh who you are or
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do you know there's always people
who are going to hate on you and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: always going to people that are going to
support you so um you know it depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: you know uh your character and you know
how you want to conduct yourself and
[SPEAKER_00]: perceive yourself so I mean I've always
been you know upfront in in everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do and open and transparent you
know and so uh no one can really say you
[SPEAKER_01]: know anything but the truth yeah certainly
I think there was some um some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: screenshots maybe just one or two of the
paperwork that have existed for some time
[SPEAKER_01]: and they they look pretty bad but they
sort of existed in isolation so as you
[SPEAKER_01]: said yeah when sun grow mids posted all of
the documentation it was a much more
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting and longer sort of read and it
sort of painted a more clear picture
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't it I guess if we sort of just jump
back to the Chem D one of the questions
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been wanting to ask you for a number
of years is what were the reasons you
[SPEAKER_01]: chose to work with the Chem D as opposed
to the 91 I didn't have the 91 at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: I only had the Chem D so that was like the
best thing that you know we had at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time at that time even Greg lost the 91 so
I mean at that time I think Skunk VA was
[SPEAKER_00]: the only one that had it and so that
didn't really resurface until you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: few years later until you know everyone
kind of got connected on on the internet
[SPEAKER_01]: okay yeah that makes sense I've noticed
that chem people tend to fall into like
[SPEAKER_01]: one of two camps of like they're either
diehard 91 or diehard Chem D and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them both I see the merits to both
of them I think you know D is probably a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot better commercially and probably you
know applicable to a wider number of
[SPEAKER_01]: people but I'm interested where do you
fall are you diehard Chem 91 or Chem D
[SPEAKER_00]: Chem D for sure you know the Chem D just
has that way more stronger effect for me
[SPEAKER_00]: it's way more terpier the 91 is nice don't
get me wrong I think it falls a little
[SPEAKER_00]: short on on strength and it's definitely
you know doesn't really have that same
[SPEAKER_00]: taste and stuff to it you know it's a
little more blandish more kind of afghani
[SPEAKER_00]: you know where you just kind of got that
little blandy you know it's kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: skunky cheminess but there's not a real
over over terp file on that so it still
[SPEAKER_00]: smokes really strong you know so you know
it's definitely it comes in probably set
[SPEAKER_00]: it definitely comes in second and in all
the chems you know I would read them Chem
[SPEAKER_00]: D 91 Chem 4 sister is how I would read
them then the three probably then going
[SPEAKER_00]: down the rest of the line but that's just
me personally yeah no good answer good
[SPEAKER_01]: answer so I read some old forum posts and
what I sort of realized from them was that
[SPEAKER_01]: in the early days there was actually like
a lot of people posting that they wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: your genetics but I think like there was
only a limited number of packs sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: available through the sites you were
referencing earlier and then there seems
[SPEAKER_01]: to sort of be this shift at some point
where like the availability went up and it
[SPEAKER_01]: made me wonder was that sort of like the
point when you were like I'm gonna do this
[SPEAKER_00]: full-time or was it coincidental well you
know early on yeah I mean I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: think you know really I did really
probably start getting you know gaining
[SPEAKER_00]: traction until you know 2009 2010 you know
that's about when you know Kyle Cushman
[SPEAKER_00]: won that one one that the High Times in
San Francisco we started first going our
[SPEAKER_00]: first show was in Denver High Times in
Denver 2011 and yeah so really you know by
[SPEAKER_00]: that time that's when we really started
you know to you know started to get
[SPEAKER_00]: popular and that was like right you know
2010 2011 that was really when the store
[SPEAKER_00]: dog really started to gain traction after
that after that well it had gotten written
[SPEAKER_00]: up on High Times and then you know it had
won the cup and so that's really when it
[SPEAKER_00]: really started you know gaining traction
and stuff so yeah so really really what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened you know so I you know that's
when I really started you know decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: really you know you know start exploring
get you know kind of you know kind of put
[SPEAKER_00]: my toe in the water sort of speak you know
we did that first High Times thing but we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't sell any seeds you know we we
weren't you know we were really green at
[SPEAKER_00]: the time so we were kind of you know we
didn't know what we were getting into we
[SPEAKER_00]: really had to like you know survey the
fucking situation and seeing what other
[SPEAKER_00]: people were doing and what we can get away
with and everything so yeah so we we came
[SPEAKER_00]: to Denver in 2011 and a lot of people came
up to us and wanted to buy seeds and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we were just kind of like overwhelmed
and being like yeah this you know it can
[SPEAKER_00]: really you know be something and so we you
know we did the so we did the show the
[SPEAKER_00]: next year 2012 and then we started selling
seeds you know at the shows and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: by that time you know and that's pretty
you know pretty you know and that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of coincides with you know the
internet thing and because we you know we
[SPEAKER_00]: were over at THC former and then there was
another site that and then and then there
[SPEAKER_00]: was a bunch of other sites that started
popping up at that same time for I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to think of the other one we were
on it was can can a collective I think
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah can a collective so you know yeah I
was having trouble with with DJ with logic
[SPEAKER_00]: and then so I want and then I started
going over to can a collective and that
[SPEAKER_00]: was right around 2012 and I wound up going
to Amsterdam in 2012 and meeting meeting a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of people out there and and you know
and so that you know but what happened was
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2013 yeah I think yes that is in 2013 I
wound up getting arrested driving coming
[SPEAKER_00]: back from my grow house and what happened
was I was up up at the house it was mom I
[SPEAKER_00]: was a Memorial Day weekend and the septic
system was broken one of the pipes got
[SPEAKER_00]: clogged so you know I couldn't use a
shower the water anything like that so I
[SPEAKER_00]: was up there cutting and usually you know
I would cut and then take a shower change
[SPEAKER_00]: my clothes and you know go home so I
couldn't take a shower so I washed up and
[SPEAKER_00]: I changed my clothes and I drove driving
home and you know I had maybe like a gram
[SPEAKER_00]: or two of flour on me in a little pipe you
know I never traveled with a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I'm driving and not paying
attention and I'm going down the hill and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing 82 and the speed limit 65 I'm
going down the hill and then it goes up
[SPEAKER_00]: the hill and so at the top of that hill
there was a cop underneath the bridge he
[SPEAKER_00]: was shooting radar going down the hill now
so as soon as I started going down and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I started going up he got me and I
knew that he got me so when I passed him
[SPEAKER_00]: he pulled fucking out and he pulled me
over you know and then I rolled down the
[SPEAKER_00]: window the first thing he said he smelled
marijuana if I had marijuana in the car
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and so I knew like you know I was
in trouble at that point you know so he
[SPEAKER_00]: rips me out of the car searches the car
and there's an empty fertilizer bottle in
[SPEAKER_00]: my trunk and then they start asking me
about where am I coming from you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: if I don't and then they start asking me
about growing weed this and that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: these are in New Jersey State troopers you
know I told them I was coming from New
[SPEAKER_00]: York State fishing I had my fishing gear
with me you know but then they started
[SPEAKER_00]: asking me if I own property up there blah
blah blah so I knew like you know there
[SPEAKER_00]: was I was in fucking I was in I was in
danger and the only thing that they had to
[SPEAKER_00]: do was call the New York State troopers
and be like yeah run this guy's name they
[SPEAKER_00]: would have ran my name and saw that my
name would have popped up on the utilities
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I you know all the bills were in
my name so they would have saw that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I had an electric bill they would
have taken a look at the electric bill and
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing that I had high usage so it had
been one foot one red flag after another
[SPEAKER_00]: red flag after another red flag so they
would have saw that they would have sent
[SPEAKER_00]: someone up to the house to do a walk
around to do some type of investigation so
[SPEAKER_00]: I had this all premeditated so after that
you know I ripped the room down and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I decided that you know I had to shut
my operation down for a year or two and so
[SPEAKER_00]: what I had to do was I had to fix the
septic I had to fix the house up and I
[SPEAKER_00]: sold it and then you know then you know I
was you know I was at that point I was
[SPEAKER_00]: just sitting on limited stock stuff that I
had made and stuff so I was you know
[SPEAKER_00]: selling some of that stuff off and then
you know I came out to Colorado and did
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado high time show in 2015 and
you know at that point you know I I had
[SPEAKER_00]: sold my house I had money in the bank like
I was ready to make a move I wasn't sure
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was gonna do I was talking to
people in Seattle and I was talking you
[SPEAKER_00]: know thinking about Denver is either gonna
be Denver or Seattle I had a I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: possible deal with someone you know in
that had a you know they were building out
[SPEAKER_00]: a warehouse and stuff so you know I had to
decide on where I wanted to go and then so
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a friend of mine you know the
Seattle thing kind of fell through and a
[SPEAKER_00]: friend of mine he had moved out from
Michigan and he had just moved out here
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's like yeah come on out you stay
with me for two weeks so the the show was
[SPEAKER_00]: around 420 and then I came back like a
month later in May and I was here for two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks and you know I was just asking
around looking to rent the house and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: asking people if anyone knew that someone
you know with you know that was cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly landlord and so my one friend
he's like him I rent from a guy and he has
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple he rent he has a couple houses
for rent so he hooked me up with his
[SPEAKER_00]: landlord and I was able to rent I had a
house for rent that I was able to grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: and so you know I decided that I was going
to you know come out here and live for a
[SPEAKER_00]: year and grow and see how I liked it you
know and so that's what I did and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: started back up and you know started
making seeds again and you know things you
[SPEAKER_00]: know were going good and I decided at that
point that I was going to buy a house you
[SPEAKER_00]: know so I the lease was over I got kicked
out of there I had to rent for a short
[SPEAKER_00]: while and then I bought a house up in the
mountains and but then I still had a house
[SPEAKER_00]: in New Jersey so so I had the house up in
the mountains and then we started looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at another house down in the Denver area
and so we sold sold our house in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Jersey and you know we moved full-time to
Colorado pretty much and so from from that
[SPEAKER_00]: point on I just been kind of you know just
been in you know once I decided to move
[SPEAKER_00]: here it was pretty much full-time because
the whole time when I was back in New
[SPEAKER_00]: Jersey I worked and I had a full-time job
in construction so I used to go work eight
[SPEAKER_00]: hours a day you know I'd wake up you know
like five six in the morning be on the job
[SPEAKER_00]: at seven o'clock we'd work till like 3 3
30 and then I would drive into New York
[SPEAKER_00]: City and I had an apartment in New York
City and that's where I sold weed out of
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I did that you know Monday Tuesday
and then on Wednesdays I would drive
[SPEAKER_00]: upstate two hours to my grow house and I
would water everything and then I would
[SPEAKER_00]: turn back around and that was my day two
hours up water two hours back all right on
[SPEAKER_00]: Wednesday Thursday you'll be back at work
and you know Friday back at work Saturday
[SPEAKER_00]: back upstate you know so I did that for
like 12 years 12 years I did that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know just doing all the driving
and all the traveling I would just
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly be getting pulled over and you
know getting you know and so finally this
[SPEAKER_00]: this was the last straw you know when I
got got you know the last time I got you
[SPEAKER_00]: know stopped and so I was like I'm out of
here I don't want to have to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: this bullshit I knew that I had you know
that there was a good prospect of the seed
[SPEAKER_00]: thing happening and the last thing I
wanted to do was like get jammed up you
[SPEAKER_00]: know in in a system and you know have to
go to jail or probation or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: because when you do when you're on all
that stuff they're in your life like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very hard to operate an illegal thing
without you know getting jammed up and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do then you're definitely going to go
to jail so I decided I wasn't going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: taking that chance I'll just go to a state
where I can grow I'm not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing for production I just need to grow
for seed production so I'm not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing you know the big huge room which I
which I and that's what I originally would
[SPEAKER_00]: do was I was originally a grower for
production and I used to do these little
[SPEAKER_00]: side seed side things on the side you know
and that's kind of how it started and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it just kind of evolved into where the
little side thing seed side thing became
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger than then you know growing for you
know production so you know once I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know I had that you know that
that possibility was out there I just
[SPEAKER_00]: decided to run with it and you know
luckily it's all it's all worked out for
[SPEAKER_01]: me yeah wow what a run I mean kudos for
driving upstate two times a week for 11
[SPEAKER_01]: years that's brutal dude I bet you're sick
of driving yeah no I put on I mean I used
[SPEAKER_00]: to put it probably like 30,000 miles a
year on my vehicle easily wow yeah well
[SPEAKER_01]: while you mentioned it you've stimulated a
thought and I want to quickly ask you
[SPEAKER_01]: before I forget it I was talking to Bob
Hemphill and he was telling me about this
[SPEAKER_01]: strain that they grow in upstate New York
never heard about it before it's called
[SPEAKER_01]: the Shire it's like a super silver sour
diesel hybrid something like along those
[SPEAKER_01]: lines but he said like goes for like a
hundred days it's like in upstate New York
[SPEAKER_01]: these guys love it and like they swear
it's the best have you ever heard of that
[SPEAKER_00]: one I've heard of the Shire but I'm not
over familiar with it and almost sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: like a redstone cross but I don't know if
that's true or not yeah I'm just not
