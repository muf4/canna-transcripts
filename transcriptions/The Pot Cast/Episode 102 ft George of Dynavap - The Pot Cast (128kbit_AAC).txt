[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys enjoy it Let's get into it
Yep, I mean, yeah, I get yeah and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, you know Every so often you you
think back to what it was like during the
[SPEAKER_01]: early struggle and you're like,
I mean I should just be grateful like
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know the struggle is different
it's it's so different and You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's certainly things to like better
about now and some things to like better
[SPEAKER_00]: about then Of course, it's so easy to How
should I put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantasize about how good things used to be
because when we're thinking about the past
[SPEAKER_00]: it's easy to overlook some of the things
that Maybe weren't as pleasant as they
[SPEAKER_00]: could have been or maybe exaggerate some
of the things that Actually weren't quite
[SPEAKER_01]: as good as you wanted them to be Totally
totally I think that's a it's such a big
[SPEAKER_01]: talking point of the show when we talk
about like these strains of years gone by
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they really that much better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly and then and then and then we go
to the next level where people are like I
[SPEAKER_01]: managed to track down a cut of that strain
and I grew it out now I grew really good
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's and I smoked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that good right, but is that the
strains fault is it the growers fault or
[SPEAKER_00]: is it actually what it was supposed to be
because you know, this isn't like Going to
[SPEAKER_00]: the pawn shop and finding some rare ends
where there's actually some Riddle
[SPEAKER_00]: relatively simplistic means of verifying
That the thing is what it's supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: right because those pictures there's
documentation There's people that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: know it now that you can't potentially
now, you know send a sample off for
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic testing and actually verify you
can To some degree, but that's also kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a pain You know, I just find it
interesting how anecdotal people's
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences are when it comes to strains
and Rarely do we hear the the context of
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience Or how that context may
have really contributed to the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know I was at this this dead
concert back in the day and this guy
[SPEAKER_00]: handed me this fill in the blank and It
was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well Maybe there were some other
contributors to the experience being
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing and and I think that's a huge
component when it comes to us as humans
[SPEAKER_00]: and Our perceptions of our experiences,
especially when it comes to things that
[SPEAKER_00]: might affect how we feel well when we're
an environment that Tends to make us feel
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good to begin with well adding a
little something else that tends to also
[SPEAKER_00]: make us feel good tends to really be
amplified in such a interesting way versus
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think about the opposite when
we're an environment that really doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute positively to us feeling good
Sometimes even the best things they only
[SPEAKER_00]: raise our level a little bit and sometimes
don't even help us get back to baseline
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think this is kind of the premise
that begins to lead people down that
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous path of addiction is Trying to
get back to where things were using a
[SPEAKER_00]: substance versus Accepting responsibility
for the fact that your life isn't the way
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want it to be and Making the
changes that you kind of know you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: make which Therefore it contributes to
having the experiences and having things
[SPEAKER_01]: more in line with what you want them to be
I Love what you said there about that sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of self work for a lot of people Cannabis
is like a self soothing thing and so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like a really hard sort of pill to
even contemplate swallowing but I know for
[SPEAKER_01]: me that I I couldn't enjoy sativas until I
did that exact personal work you said and
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't feel anxious from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt invigorated and and it totally
changed my perception of it It's been a
[SPEAKER_00]: really fascinating experience for me,
especially over the last, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: five six seven years as I'll just say the
process of Waking up has progressed you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and That might be kind of a
challenging term It might be a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing You know for those that haven't
heard it and so if you don't mind I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just elaborate a little bit because it's
It's a term that I like to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's others out there but I'm
nothing there's not a particular person
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes to mind, but When I use the
term waking up what I really am referring
[SPEAKER_00]: to is the kind of realization that life is
our own personal responsibility and If
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not happy Well, there's really only
one person in this whole universe that can
[SPEAKER_00]: do anything about that and It's not
someone other than The person that's
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking this right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can't take this simple step to
wake up and Acknowledge that if we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeking something that we think is going
to make us happy yet, we don't accept
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility for finding the path to get
there then It's just simply not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen You know our happiness is our own
personal responsibility and The
[SPEAKER_00]: realization of this and the
acknowledgement of it It's not exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable But it can change everything
once we can accept it and Start to make
[SPEAKER_00]: our choices based on that knowledge Well,
then things start to change in a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting way I Love this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am I wish I wish I was able to go here
more with guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful because You know,
it's interesting you mentioned that and
[SPEAKER_01]: like in the context of say consuming
cannabis people often say like without it
[SPEAKER_01]: it feels sort of all encompassing this
this feeling of I don't know if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: dissatisfaction, but it's it's sort of a
difficulty I Wonder if there is
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially an inverse relationship
because I've often said to people If you
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like you're not getting as much out
of cannabis as you would like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know It's not getting you to where you
want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you try actually smoking less?
[SPEAKER_01]: and paradoxically, you know, you like I
think the rationale is like your tolerance
[SPEAKER_01]: would lower but like I've sort of noticed
that like the the more the less you lean
[SPEAKER_01]: on it the more it's able to offer you and
and I personally during times when I've
[SPEAKER_01]: taken tolerance breaks and you come back
You're like, you know, you're blasted
[SPEAKER_01]: sky-high and you're like, oh wow You know,
and it's almost like there's a ceiling put
[SPEAKER_01]: on it through Abuse or using it too much
in a way You know, I'm really glad to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: you phrase it that way Because I very much
agree with you in fact this has been
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially from the very beginning of
Dynavap kind of a Kind of a guiding
[SPEAKER_00]: principle behind what it is that we're
doing now Keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did just release a product this past
summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll call the hyper dine, which is our
much larger capacity product Okay Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: why do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's clearly people out there
that are looking for more and whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: those reasons are are Not for us to
determine if it's what they actually need
[SPEAKER_00]: or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to the individual I know that
for me from a personal basis and what I
[SPEAKER_00]: found tends to be the case for many other
people that I've had a little opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to know them a little bit better is
Less is more applies in many many cases
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's so it's really fascinating to
hear you say that because I found it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the same thing for me and The vast
majority of the products that we
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture and offer Are very small not
just in terms of how they fit in your hand
[SPEAKER_00]: But the extraction chamber is actually
pretty small too and can be further
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced in most of them by another half or
50% Which makes it a really really useful
[SPEAKER_01]: tool for micro dosing Yet totally,
you know and it's and it's such a an
[SPEAKER_01]: Invoke term that I feel like sometimes it
it loses its value You know, like it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: like thrown around that it's synonymous
with like I've got my coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got my micro Don't let you know what I
mean, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but but but what you're saying is is
like there's some real value in in what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're saying in in reducing the amount
and I've tried this with a few different
[SPEAKER_01]: things, but I I'd love to hear your
thoughts on it before we move on to the
[SPEAKER_01]: next topic which I want to ask you about
which is essentially the the calculator on
[SPEAKER_01]: your side, but like let's just let's just
talk a little more about like the the
[SPEAKER_01]: micro dosing because I think I mentioned
to you last time and if I I'm sorry if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: repeating myself, but if not I want to
make sure I mentioned in case I didn't but
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a buddy of mine and he's like a
proper professional industry like
[SPEAKER_01]: white-collar really really high up can't
be high at work sort of thing and he talks
[SPEAKER_01]: about like as he's walking to the train in
the morning he high he hits his little M
[SPEAKER_01]: unit and he just wants that little turpid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and he's like there's zero
psychoactive effect, but it just puts you
[SPEAKER_01]: in the perfect spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and and to me that speaks volumes
about what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and that's really good to hear
because that's that's a big part of what
[SPEAKER_00]: the intent was from the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there's there's two
principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to touch on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the microdoses one of them,
but the other one is the administration
[SPEAKER_00]: route and method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and you know what I mean by that is
you can take a small bit of tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a tiny little puff off of a
joint or a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, you can also take a little puff off
of a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but if they're all the same strain,
well there's really only one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: options that I just mentioned that allows
you to further subdivide what is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for and separate it from
the things that you're not and that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good quality vaporizer or what we like to
call our products the thermal extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: device because with a product like this we
can take not just a microdose,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we can take a temperature specific
dose and what that amounts to is a low
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature dose of the same strain is
going to have a profoundly different
[SPEAKER_00]: effect than a high temperature dose of the
same size from the same strain and so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get into layers and levels of nuance
that just really aren't possible with any
[SPEAKER_00]: other consumption process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh totally and we need to loop back to
that because I wanted to actually talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: you about a few different sort of
extraction type questions specifically but
[SPEAKER_01]: before we move on, I don't know if you've
noticed I've been subtly doing my own
[SPEAKER_01]: little AB here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that, I see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the viewers who are listening in I've
got the M unit in my hand and I've also
[SPEAKER_01]: got one of the Storm Bickels units in my
hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that I really have been noticing
recently and I promise this isn't just
[SPEAKER_01]: because you said it is how big the chamber
is on the Storm Bickels unit and I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: what is it a venti because I you know
there are there are situations where I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's applicable but gosh it bloody
chews through the product like no tomorrow
[SPEAKER_01]: and and what I realized is it doesn't get
you anywhere near as high as so to speak
[SPEAKER_01]: like the the intensity of effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're thinking like I want to sit down
and have a big one and shoot into space so
[SPEAKER_01]: to speak like that's not going to happen
on a Storm Bickel unit in my opinion it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just it's a slow extraction unit whereas I
feel like this for me and this is all
[SPEAKER_01]: personal you know you're welcome to
disagree I'm anyone listening I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: for me this this truly replicates the heat
in a way that is efficient because it it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to me like the amount of material
I'm putting in the chamber of the DynaVap
[SPEAKER_01]: is about the amount I would put in the
average cone piece when you say cone piece
[SPEAKER_01]: like in like a little a single little bong
here just just a little one hitter yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a tiny little one right because uh
you know most people when they're when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're using just just a standard DynaVap
M for example they're going to put in
[SPEAKER_00]: usually less than 0.1 grams can you cram
0.1 in there yeah you can but ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: being pretty tight so a typical load is
less than 0.1 so you're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum of 10 fills per gram and the
reality is for most people is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to 15 per gram right and then on
top of that you can sip on it right you
[SPEAKER_00]: can take just one little puff and things
cool down pretty quick put it right back
[SPEAKER_00]: in your pocket and you can save the rest
for later so it makes for a rather
[SPEAKER_00]: conservative approach for for those that
don't have a rather large stash oh totally
[SPEAKER_01]: and and when I um when my mates end up
like getting a DynaVap they ask me like
[SPEAKER_01]: how when do I need to reload it with fresh
material and I always say that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: there's like three or four good deep hits
in it before I would and that's my
[SPEAKER_01]: anecdotal advice do you do you have an
answer for that question that's like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know three or four or something like that
and as a quick follow-up what's the saving
[SPEAKER_01]: on the you know with the calculator on the
site how much do you think you save
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage wise so what I can comfortably
say is from a savings perspective it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very very rare that we encounter any
feedback from any customer that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: say that when they're again comparing our
products to smoking for example that their
[SPEAKER_00]: usage hasn't been at a minimum cut in half
okay but it's not uncommon for us to get
[SPEAKER_00]: feedback from people that it's quite a bit
more than that where you know here the
[SPEAKER_00]: same quantity whether it's you know you
know couple grams eighth however you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to describe your your your quantity that
you consume per week per month whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: well all of a sudden it's not that I'm
just consuming half but you know normally
[SPEAKER_00]: I would buy the same amount every week and
so I was in kind of the habit of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know I'm speaking as a customer
and after I got this product I started
[SPEAKER_00]: using it well I found that for a couple
two three weeks my stash was so big that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had to completely change what I was doing
and now here I am a month later and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: getting old and so it just it became kind
of a profound experience that had to
[SPEAKER_00]: change habits and why well because my
flower was getting old not because they
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like oh I can only have a little bit
at a time only have a little bit of time
[SPEAKER_00]: no it's not like that at all the the
people that buy the product are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of shocked at how they find that
they're at or even slightly above the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of satisfaction that they're seeking
consistently as often as they would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to be sometimes even more more often than
they would then they were comparatively
[SPEAKER_00]: from smoking because there's some other
advantages because you don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke and so you can be a bit more
discreet and you don't have as much odor
[SPEAKER_00]: around and still the usage goes down
that's one of the biggest things I've
[SPEAKER_01]: noticed is that it really sort of hits
that satiation point you feel like you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got to where you wanted to go and then
you're good for ages which I love yeah I
[SPEAKER_01]: think for me in my personal instance it
would be more than more than half this is
[SPEAKER_01]: the other thing I've noticed with the
other vapes and you might have a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: insight into this I noticed that if I load
them up they end up like I've got a it
[SPEAKER_01]: ends up like condensing in the stem
somewhere and you end up getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: like I don't know the vape equivalent of
CRC or something like that and you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: clean it out right yeah and obviously you
don't get any of that with the DynaVapes
[SPEAKER_01]: so I think is that just a reflection of
the efficiencies well so there's a number
[SPEAKER_00]: of interesting things at play here one of
them is we're we're functioning way more
[SPEAKER_00]: in an on-demand function than most of the
other products that are currently on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market okay because again there's always
exceptions and please I don't want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: misunderstood in any way guard I'm not
trying to downplay anyone else's product
[SPEAKER_00]: at all okay there's other products on the
market and some of them are actually very
[SPEAKER_00]: good you know I even own some of them
we're just our products have a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a different approach and in comparison
if you think again just use the DynaVap M
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's one of our best-selling
products you can go from something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: room temperature to something that is
ready for low temperature extraction in
[SPEAKER_00]: under 10 seconds or at the same time for a
few seconds more you can do a near
[SPEAKER_00]: complete what they like to refer to as a
one-hit extraction and strip out almost
[SPEAKER_00]: everything worth taking from the whole
chamber in one go and it's cool enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: put back in your pocket all in under a
minute and why does this matter well it
[SPEAKER_00]: matters for a couple of reasons the first
is a lot of the active compounds that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're seeking to consume they degrade at
temperature and if they don't degrade they
[SPEAKER_00]: change character at temperature and this
is a big part of the reason why edibles
[SPEAKER_00]: have a different effect than inhaled
compounds of course you got liver enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: and other things like that to come into
place I'm trying to misconstrue anything
[SPEAKER_00]: but when we take material that's been held
at temperature for a long time it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be different than something that's
heated up quick extracted quick and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're done well if you don't consume all
of it in one go it's cooling back down
[SPEAKER_00]: very quickly which helps to contribute to
that overall conservation okay the other
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that also really helps is because we
can get a very concentrated output because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the way that the product works we can
produce vapor that is very similar in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of nature and character and
intensity as smoke this also really helps
[SPEAKER_00]: people with that transition when they
choose that the time is right for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: inhale less smoke and go for an
alternative well DynaVap can provide an
[SPEAKER_00]: experience that under most people's
opinion is more analogous to smoking than
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much anything else that's out there
because you can get that really thick
[SPEAKER_00]: flavorful high-intensity experience
absolutely absolutely and one of the the
[SPEAKER_01]: questions I had been asked by a buddy who
had recently got on to vaping as opposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to combustion was he was sort of saying oh
you know I'm just and I've heard this
[SPEAKER_01]: before is people say that would they say
there's two things the first is that they
[SPEAKER_01]: they want their palate to readjust
straight away and I try to explain to them
[SPEAKER_01]: that that takes time you know like that's
like a beer drinker having a wine like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's probably going to taste pretty
general and you know you don't pick up on
[SPEAKER_01]: the nuances like the beer but you know so
I'd love to hear your thoughts on that but
[SPEAKER_01]: also about the flavor profile you know and
I just say look the terpenes are in like
[SPEAKER_01]: the first hit and you know you really just
enjoy that but I was wondering do you
[SPEAKER_01]: think we'll ever get to the point where we
can somehow get the terpenes to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: like proportionately come out with each
hit or is it just invariable due to the
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanics that like they're just going to
be in that first hit predominantly okay I
[SPEAKER_00]: really really like that question okay
because I mean at the core right what is
[SPEAKER_00]: an enthusiast in this space looking for
right we're looking not just for how is
[SPEAKER_00]: this going to make me feel no we're
looking for everything right and the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor is a really large component of that
right you know if flavor didn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: people wouldn't bother with all these
beers with all of these flavors in them
[SPEAKER_00]: they would just simply pour a little bit
of distilled ethanol in some water at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same concentration carbonate it and boom
you're gonna get the same effect without
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor okay flavor flavor really
really matters right so how do we get that
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful flavorful hit each time well
there is a way and it's actually not very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult okay and the fun thing is you're
already either doing it or almost doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: okay and here's how it works okay and the
results of this might actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: surprising for people if you haven't tried
this yet I'm gonna encourage you to give
[SPEAKER_00]: it a shot right and that's this if you
have any Dynavap that's been manufactured
[SPEAKER_00]: recently you know an M just about anything
except the hyperdyne or of course the B
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm gonna say that because the B is
kind of permanent half bowl size anyway so
[SPEAKER_00]: really really small you know 0.5 maximum
load even if you're packing it stiff it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's tiny okay but if you put the chamber
into the smaller position and just do a
[SPEAKER_00]: light load heat it up and heat middle of
the cap maybe base of the cap you know
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to the stem so it gets a little bit
hotter and just extract the vast majority
[SPEAKER_00]: of what you want in one go and here's how
I'm gonna prescribe that you do that okay
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as it clicks put it in your mouth
pretend the airport doesn't exist in fact
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you do not obstruct it and if
you're going to only for one to two
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds and then get your finger out of
the way and let the fluid dynamics that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been engineered into this product do
their magic okay and just do a nice long
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable inhale and what you're gonna
find is something rather surprising okay
[SPEAKER_00]: this product will function in ways that
just maybe won't make sense okay and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you end up with is all that beautiful
flavor for an extended period of time a
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonably good extraction of everything
that's now in your half chamber and here's
[SPEAKER_00]: the best part you just consumed likely
less than five hundredths of a gram okay
[SPEAKER_00]: well as soon as that cap clicks empty it
out save it in your ABV jar reload it and
[SPEAKER_00]: by the time you get done reloading it then
think to yourself okay how do I feel do I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually want now or did I just prepare
this for my future self I love that a
[SPEAKER_00]: little a little future gift for me well at
least that's how it works for me is that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just take a little taste and I think
like many people I'm always looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more depending on what's going
on okay but by the time I get done going
[SPEAKER_00]: through the process of preparing that
little bit more I take a breath and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think okay now what I'm gonna do next and
I come to the realization that actually no
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm exactly where I want to be right now
cool and it just goes right back in my
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket and the next time I'm craving a
little bit of that beautiful flavor I know
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a few seconds away that's epic I
I'm gonna have to give that a go and I
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage everyone to to rewind it back
and to take a hit just how it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribed I'm really excited for that
well it's it's a really interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: experience because there's a couple fun
things that happen when we use the product
[SPEAKER_00]: in this way and I'll try and do my best to
describe with words you know for those
[SPEAKER_00]: people that just aren't able to really see
because again what am I really gonna show
[SPEAKER_00]: okay but with a dynamite product you've
got a cap right that covers the chamber
[SPEAKER_00]: that cap has a thermostat in it okay that
gives us a little click or two to let us
[SPEAKER_00]: know when our extraction chamber or our
oven is about at the right temperature now
[SPEAKER_00]: of course we can adjust that temperature a
little bit by how we heat whether we go a
[SPEAKER_00]: little deeper in an induction heater or by
moving our lighter a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the crimp on the cap or a little
bit the opposite direction which we call
[SPEAKER_00]: more towards the base right heat the tip
for a tasty rip or heat the base to go to
[SPEAKER_00]: space and this works particularly well on
the the m7 stainless steel tips you know
[SPEAKER_00]: below the base to melt your face because
it'll give you that highest temperature in
[SPEAKER_00]: your oven without necessarily combustion
so you can get everything kind of all in
[SPEAKER_00]: one go anyway when we leave the airport
uncovered and we simply draw on the device
[SPEAKER_00]: the airports have been kind of engineered
to be of a shape or size that when you
[SPEAKER_00]: draw on it the way that we feel most
people draw on it you get a fair bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: air that comes through that airport which
helps to cool and condition that vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes it way more pleasant and
comfortable to inhale it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: dilute the flavor at all okay but the
other thing that it does do is it
[SPEAKER_00]: minimizes how much air goes through the
oven or the extraction chamber and why
[SPEAKER_00]: does this matter it matters because well
let's think about it last time you burned
[SPEAKER_00]: your finger the first thing you did is
blow on it right to cool it off okay well
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not what we want to do to our
extraction chamber we just got done
[SPEAKER_00]: heating it up we want it to stay hot long
enough that we can extract when we cover
[SPEAKER_00]: the airport and hit it hard we're forcing
more air to go through than is necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: to displace the vapor that's being
produced okay which cools it down faster
[SPEAKER_00]: so here's why that matters right we leave
that airport open we're able to get a big
[SPEAKER_00]: nice comfortable draw our extraction
chamber stays at extraction temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe as much as 30 or 40 percent longer
okay so you can get sometimes an
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely massive hit even though the
airport is wide open because your chamber
[SPEAKER_00]: stays hot longer and you can just keep
pulling and pulling and pulling that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's also another brilliant point I am I
hadn't I had sort of anecdotally been
[SPEAKER_01]: playing around with different settings and
hadn't quite pieced together why some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the hits were working a lot better but I
think you've just sort of helped me to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand why and it brings us to this
sort of topic I wanted to ask you about
[SPEAKER_01]: which is one of the things I love about
the Dynav app is for lack of a better
[SPEAKER_01]: words I think there is like this huge sort
of skill cap in a sense you know if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to think of it like a game like you
know you can pick it up and you can do a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty cumbersome job and still get where
you want but then you can also like really
[SPEAKER_01]: you know bang out the Mona Lisa of hits
and just get perfect what what's your
[SPEAKER_01]: advice to people about the skill curve and
how to get better with it okay oh that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's so good and I think you put it in a
really elegant way because I think it just
[SPEAKER_00]: makes sense right you take the same tool
and you put it in the hands of someone
[SPEAKER_00]: that's never used the tool or someone
that's been using that tool for 40 years
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna see a different output right
that's just skill and that's something
[SPEAKER_00]: that as humans we just develop
intrinsically by doing the things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: do repeatedly right that's what experience
is all about okay and that in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: is I think the appeal of the analog device
right analog meaning who's in control the
[SPEAKER_00]: person holding the device right yes we've
got all kinds of what I'm gonna call quasi
[SPEAKER_00]: controls on all the battery powered and
digital devices right we're technically in
[SPEAKER_00]: control because we're turning them on
right we're technically in control because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're setting the temperature okay but
we're only indirectly in control because
[SPEAKER_00]: when we set the temperature we're just
setting some arbitrary parameters and
[SPEAKER_00]: letting the electronics do everything else
when we use a product like Dynavap we are
[SPEAKER_00]: the control and there's a little something
extra that comes from being the control
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not unlike for any of the you that
have ever driven a manual transmission car
[SPEAKER_00]: or motorcycle right in understanding the
interplay between the throttle and the
[SPEAKER_00]: clutch who's in control right and the
finesse that a person that understands
[SPEAKER_00]: those controls can apply to a wide range
of circumstances whether it's the hill
[SPEAKER_00]: start or you know just comfortably
changing gears sometimes without even
[SPEAKER_00]: using the clutch under the right
circumstances because you know your
[SPEAKER_00]: vehicle and you know that you can
synchronize things and just make it happen
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're just familiar with it
totally so I mean I guess as an extension
[SPEAKER_01]: of that I want to know like is there what
what's your personal routine for taking a
[SPEAKER_01]: hit is it is it as simple as like you know
I just at the base if I want to go hard or
[SPEAKER_01]: is there a bit more finesse and a little
extra you do that you think sort of adds
[SPEAKER_00]: to it all well that that's a fun one
because it depends if I'm doing it for
[SPEAKER_00]: myself or I'm doing it for someone else
right and so I get the the distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: pleasure of being able to introduce people
to this product for the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: occasionally right and it's really fun
when okay you get the introductions or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe so much you've known for a while or
you're being introduced by someone that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've known for a while hey I want you
meet so-and-so and you know that they
[SPEAKER_00]: really like to smoke they've tried a
number of different options but it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: never really done it for them okay all
right well that's great information so now
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that hmm I'm gonna heat the base so
this person can go to space and so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can really understand the true potential
of we'll just say this side of the force
[SPEAKER_00]: right it can be really powerful if you
want it to be but you know for my own
[SPEAKER_00]: personal preferences well that's the
beautiful thing of having the analog
[SPEAKER_00]: product that hmm right now where I want to
be in a high functioning state so I can
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully string together the right words
and the right combination to communicate
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively and tell a kind of a fun story
I didn't exactly heat the base if you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what I mean there may be other
circumstances where okay everything that
[SPEAKER_00]: really needed to get done has now been
checked off the list okay do I have
[SPEAKER_00]: something to drink nearby yes cool do I
have something to snack on nearby yes cool
[SPEAKER_00]: hmm is there something interesting in
front of me to do for the next time frame
[SPEAKER_00]: or I don't have to change my physical
location check okay it might take a little
[SPEAKER_01]: longer to reach the click at this point in
time I love that I love that that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful and I mean normally we start off
with this question but I forgot to ask you
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you been smoking on recently okay
so this is a really fun one and I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna remember the names of all of the
strains but I was at a conference gosh
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been two weeks ago now maybe a little
bit longer than that and met up with
[SPEAKER_00]: another you know good friend and he's also
kind of a grower girl some really good
[SPEAKER_00]: quality stuff and so I gotta add more
context because it's just gonna really
[SPEAKER_00]: help add the flavor to why this is just
fun right okay so met up with him haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: seen him geez it's been probably seven
eight months right I think I saw him in
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas last time and so we're just kind of
catching up and then he had to go I had
[SPEAKER_00]: something else going on great hey can I
leave my bag you know in your room sure no
[SPEAKER_00]: problem just going out to an event and
having bags in an event is just no fun
[SPEAKER_00]: right it's nice just be travel light I
figured it was gonna be late by the time
[SPEAKER_00]: he got back and then it was kind of late
before I was finally getting to bed and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone kind of left like 2 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: like all right I'm gonna get some sleep
got a lot to do tomorrow so I go to bed
[SPEAKER_00]: and I get a phone call at like 419 in the
morning it's like hey can I come get my
[SPEAKER_00]: bag it's like okay normally if I get a
call four o'clock in the morning it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't exactly put me in the best frame
of mind but here I am in a really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting place doing some really cool
stuff meeting up with a bunch of nice
[SPEAKER_00]: people and why would I be upset about a
person I really like calling me at four o
[SPEAKER_00]: 'clock in the morning to come down the
elevator and let him up to the room I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna be able to do this tomorrow
or the next day okay cool put a smile on
[SPEAKER_00]: my face got out of bed got dressed went
down the elevator picked him up and we go
[SPEAKER_00]: back to the room the couple that he was
with they grabbed their stuff and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were on their way and now here I am it's
getting down to a 430 quarter to 5 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning having a chat getting caught up
and he's like oh hey you know check out
[SPEAKER_00]: this flower I've got you want some I was
like sure and he starts grabbing a butt of
[SPEAKER_00]: this this one's strawberry cough and this
one's a lemon like a lemon haze right and
[SPEAKER_00]: he picked up like two more and put them
all out there fantastic right now what am
[SPEAKER_00]: I gonna do with it well well what I ended
up doing is they ended up becoming their
[SPEAKER_00]: own strain because all four of them got
mixed up because that can have kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: fun effect all by itself and that's that's
what's been kind of my favorite here here
[SPEAKER_00]: the past week or two is I've got this like
quadruple entourage mixture of four really
[SPEAKER_01]: nice strains grown with love and care by
someone that has some passion for about
[SPEAKER_01]: next which was blending both within
strains you know two three four different
[SPEAKER_01]: strains but without going to out in the
deep end I also wanted to ask have you
[SPEAKER_01]: ever heard from people who have
experimented with like blending tobacco in
[SPEAKER_01]: there with it now this is obviously not
like any sort of you know go smoke tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: kids or anything like that like if you
smoke it cool but I am interested because
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had other guests on the show notably
Bodhi and he you know he's like a very
[SPEAKER_01]: spiritual guy and and I he gave this
description that really resonated with me
[SPEAKER_01]: and he says look you know I don't smoke
with tobacco but like once every so often
[SPEAKER_01]: I do and I sort of think of it as like a
saddle and it's like when you put a saddle
[SPEAKER_01]: on a horse you can go to a different place
than if you didn't have maybe a little
[SPEAKER_01]: further or you know different terrain
absolutely I'd love to hear your thoughts
[SPEAKER_00]: on blending and anything you heard so I
don't personally use tobacco on a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: basis I'm not gonna say that I don't
occasionally consume a small amount the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing kind of goes when it comes to
you know other things like beer etc I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that the human as an individual and
if we want to say as a spiritual being
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits and I want to really emphasize
that word benefits significantly from an
[SPEAKER_00]: occasional shift in perspective and change
of state of mind in fact I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably one of the most valuable things
that an individual can do to help them
[SPEAKER_00]: become a little bit more of a full person
and become a little bit more aware of not
[SPEAKER_00]: only who they are but how they fit into
everything else and interface with
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone else and tobacco when used
properly with a little bit of respect can
[SPEAKER_00]: contribute to that okay but since we're
talking about a bit of a controversial
[SPEAKER_00]: topic I think it's probably worth adding a
few additional words to define what I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: when I say using tobacco with respect what
that what does that mean it doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling a spliff that's 50% tobacco and
that's your typical daily consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: routine no if that's what you do and
that's what you choose to do I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: pass judgment okay but that's just doing
it because it makes it hit harder okay but
[SPEAKER_00]: if you very rarely consume tobacco a small
amount because again sometimes less is
[SPEAKER_00]: more can really function as an amplifier
and bring out some characteristics and
[SPEAKER_00]: some nuance in a strain that you might be
very familiar with that all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in a very different state or a very
different place but not necessarily in an
[SPEAKER_00]: unpleasant way and I think this is one of
those things that tobacco can contribute
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll find other interesting examples
of this especially from some of the South
[SPEAKER_00]: American natives okay who it was kind of
where tobacco originated in terms of its
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction into we'll call it the
current modern world right this this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: really revered for what it could do it
wasn't consumed you know multiple times a
[SPEAKER_00]: day every single day by those people it
was consumed on an occasional basis okay
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've ever heard the term peace pipe
you know this wasn't the thing that people
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing all the time you know
cigarettes didn't exist you know
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarettes just make things way too easy
too convenient and I think they contribute
[SPEAKER_00]: to the dependency but I think like many
other things whether it's alcohol cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know we can insert many other
things into this category when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: used respectfully in a reasonable amount
on an occasional basis they can contribute
[SPEAKER_00]: positively to the overall impact that that
experience can have for the individual or
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially the group of people that are
kind of getting together you know likely
[SPEAKER_00]: for some sort of celebration or community
or gathering or what have you totally
[SPEAKER_01]: totally totally I am it's interesting you
know because I I was like one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: guys who used to mix it consistently when
I was very young and and it was so
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to get off and I realized I was
inadvertently addicted to tobacco just
[SPEAKER_01]: through the way I smoked it with weed but
I never considered myself like a tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: smoker really because I'd never smoked
cigarettes I just mix it bit right but I
[SPEAKER_01]: realized I had certainly got addicted
anyway so for a long time I was super
[SPEAKER_01]: hesitant to go back despite hearing this
sort of thing because I was like oh man I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get addicted but I'll reassure
everyone you know you can certainly do it
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's just once every so often it's it's
really you know like I don't want to say
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like doing psychedelics but it kind
of is in the way that you like you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you sort of not that you're gonna have
some sort of psychedelic experience but
[SPEAKER_01]: you're hoping to gain something from this
as like a sort of spiritual thing as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to just like oh I'm just getting
high with tobacco tonight and I
[SPEAKER_01]: wholeheartedly I wholeheartedly agree as a
quick follow-up do you know is it possible
[SPEAKER_01]: to use a dynavap to do that or do you
think oh it's it's not going to work the
[SPEAKER_00]: way you'd want it no it it actually works
really really well so here's a bit of fun
[SPEAKER_00]: history right so when I was in the early
stages of developing some of the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: products you know for dynavap there's a
couple key principles that I established
[SPEAKER_00]: early on that were part of the that
constituted the goal right and what I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: there is okay before dynavap existed
really as a company I was just you know
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting on the couch you know one one
evening with a couple people I like
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out with and we were using what at
the time was my first vaporizer a little
[SPEAKER_00]: butane powered iolite made by a company in
Ireland right really neat little thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: it makes for a really pleasant experience
but it's big it's bulky it's expensive and
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're talking about it as we're
enjoying it's like you know why do these
[SPEAKER_00]: things need to be so big it's so expensive
and you know is the future going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: place where a lot fewer people light their
flower on fire and more people simply bake
[SPEAKER_00]: it instead of burning it and it's like you
know I think so but not if it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be this expensive it's just not going to
be practical you know except for people
[SPEAKER_00]: that have access to a lot of resources and
I was just thinking is like well that's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of sad because here you've got
something that can be so impactful but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just not accessible in a way that's
not harmful okay so that kind of was the
[SPEAKER_00]: impetus for for doing all of this and once
that question was planted well you know
[SPEAKER_00]: how big and how expensive does a vaporizer
need to be well let's try and make one and
[SPEAKER_00]: find out all right well then the next
question start to follow suit and say okay
[SPEAKER_00]: well if we're going to make something that
is really geared towards a product that is
[SPEAKER_00]: applicable to is brought a range of people
from as many walks of life as possible to
[SPEAKER_00]: have is positive an impact on society in
general as we can to make it so that
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking becomes more of a choice than a
necessity you know for a route of
[SPEAKER_00]: administration because really even some of
the most poor people could afford you know
[SPEAKER_00]: a product like Dynavap where here you
could buy this thing yeah it might cost
[SPEAKER_00]: you a week's pay but it'll last you your
whole life and it'll actually pay for
[SPEAKER_00]: itself over and over and over again just
in what it saves you in terms of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're consuming on top of the fact that
you're going to be consuming a lot less
[SPEAKER_00]: harmful things so it can have a a
multiplied effect of positivity on the
[SPEAKER_00]: individual as well as the people around
that individual okay well how do we get
[SPEAKER_00]: there and how do we make something as that
form factor that just makes sense and
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar because we're already gonna be
changing the the whole approach here by
[SPEAKER_00]: not lighting things right by now we got a
heat them instead of light them and people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't change easily or readily well so the
answer to that question is we need to do
[SPEAKER_00]: everything we practically can to emulate
the ritual of smoking okay so the very
[SPEAKER_00]: first prototypes were aimed at making a
product that was as similar and as
[SPEAKER_00]: analogous to smoking as we practically
could and even so far as when I started
[SPEAKER_00]: working with some of the the glass like
well I want to use glass that's got an
[SPEAKER_00]: eight millimeter inside diameter because
then people that are smoking cigarettes
[SPEAKER_00]: can simply insert the end of a cigarette
and snap it off and literally use a
[SPEAKER_00]: cigarette as a multi-use cartridge to fill
their Dynavap device with their tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe just a couple times a day
they'll use Dynavap instead of lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: the cigarette and find that wow I can
thermally extract one Chambers worth or
[SPEAKER_00]: generally never about a fifth or sixth of
a cigarette and get near the same level of
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfaction I get from smoking a whole
cigarette experience some harm reduction
[SPEAKER_00]: some cost savings a whole different flavor
profile and just do it simply and easily
[SPEAKER_00]: so long answer to your question there
Dynavap absolutely will work with
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional tobacco in fact for those
people that really have we'll call it a
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with tobacco some good
quality pipe tobacco is actually quite
[SPEAKER_00]: delightful because I mean think I've
rarely run across a person that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually like the way pipe tobacco smells
both in raw form when you open the bag and
[SPEAKER_00]: even being burned it actually smells quite
nice doesn't taste quite as nice as it
[SPEAKER_00]: smells until you put it into your thermal
extraction device and then you find that
[SPEAKER_00]: wow it actually tastes like it smells and
that became a lot more apparent to me you
[SPEAKER_00]: know during those early days of
development where I would actually take a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of pipe tobacco because I
wanted to understand okay the
[SPEAKER_00]: applicability not only towards tobacco but
across the whole board because I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to just make a product that was just
geared towards cannabis the goal was to if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've ever seen it in some of our
marketing stuff you know our our goal as a
[SPEAKER_00]: company our mission is to make smoking
history right and so I like that because
[SPEAKER_00]: we can interpret it multiple ways okay and
I'm not saying that one way is the correct
[SPEAKER_00]: way because maybe it's both okay or all
three and it's not just smoking cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: right it's if we have a product that
allows a person to get what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for from the plant matter that
they choose to get it from well great now
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get what you're looking for
without lighting it on fire and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve what in my opinion is probably
one of the most important aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming that material that there is and
the consuming of the material is not the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important thing it's the ritual of
consuming that material that matters the
[SPEAKER_01]: most that might sound a little bit odd to
you no not at all I mean I I think if you
[SPEAKER_01]: if you haven't heard of set and setting
where have you been under a rock yeah no
[SPEAKER_00]: it it makes such a profound difference and
I think here again this is another
[SPEAKER_00]: contributor to when people are having
challenges with substances right the the
[SPEAKER_00]: ritual can either help or can hinder
things okay because the ritual is all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those actions and those motions that we go
through in preparation for what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to experience when we consume okay
and that's whether we're going to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge grabbing a beer cracking it open
and getting that first smell and taste
[SPEAKER_00]: okay this is ritual right or grabbing your
pack of cigarettes and tapping it three
[SPEAKER_00]: times pulling out the lighter putting the
cigarette in taking a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: taste before we light it and all of these
things that happen in sequence right the
[SPEAKER_00]: actions that happen in sequence especially
the the ones that tend to be not just two
[SPEAKER_00]: or three seconds long but minutes long
okay setting down at the table grinding
[SPEAKER_00]: things up and preparing to roll up a joint
or a spliff or whatever you want might
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do okay where it takes a little
bit of time this time calms the mind it
[SPEAKER_00]: prepares the mind and the body for what's
about to happen okay it actually sets
[SPEAKER_00]: forth a whole cascading chain of chemical
reactions in the brain in the releasing of
[SPEAKER_00]: various neurotransmitters before
anything's actually been consumed because
[SPEAKER_00]: we have trained ourselves the process
we've trained ourselves a ritual and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: trained ourselves about what is going to
happen next and so going through this
[SPEAKER_00]: ritual sets those wheels of anticipation
in motion and they are so powerful that
[SPEAKER_00]: how I'll use some stories that I've heard
from the community okay that people sit
[SPEAKER_00]: down and go through the ritual and will
heat up their their VAP cap get the click
[SPEAKER_00]: take a good long pull and think well
didn't taste as strong as I thought it was
[SPEAKER_00]: going to but okay and exhale out little to
nothing feel better and then when the cap
[SPEAKER_00]: clicks and cools off we'll take off the
cap and look inside to find that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing there but yet that empty chamber
provides a surprising amount of relief and
[SPEAKER_00]: why is that well you've just given
yourself a near placebo right very little
[SPEAKER_00]: active compound but you have executed the
most important part of the administration
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not the consumption it's the ritual
totally and you see this in even more
[SPEAKER_01]: extreme examples I've read about people
trying to get off heroin and they'll say
[SPEAKER_01]: that you know they they inject saline just
because exactly what you said going
[SPEAKER_01]: through that ritual it's so
dopaminergically related that it is it's
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to quantify and you know I found this
to be most evident in two situations first
[SPEAKER_01]: of all when I first switched to vaping
what I didn't realize like so when I first
[SPEAKER_01]: switched to vaping it was like when you're
a kid and I don't know if you remember
[SPEAKER_01]: this but like you would smoke and it would
actually take like three to five minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: before you really sort of became super
aware that you were high and then I'm like
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my god okay so when I used to hit a
bong and I would feel good straight away
[SPEAKER_01]: that first few minutes that was just all
the ritual because like I know that it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes a little bit of time to actually and
the same thing happens to a friend who
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't smoke and you give him a hit
they're like at first they're like I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really feel it and then a few minutes
later they're on the couch and exactly and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah so it really goes to show and then
the other thing I was going to quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: mention because when you were talking it's
all I could think about like as you were
[SPEAKER_01]: discussing it is I was I was recently on
holiday and so like you know I was in a
[SPEAKER_01]: different state and out of my normal
environment and I found pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently I was hitting the Dynavap
twice a day whereas I'm now at home with
[SPEAKER_01]: the same herb back to my normal grind and
I could hit the Dynavap a couple times a
[SPEAKER_01]: day and so when I was away I was like wow
did like this is what it should be but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just that I'm in my normal
environment I feel like it's all a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: same samey right it's really interesting
and so now I'm trying to push myself to be
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know I know that I can get by
with X you can right you know to a degree
[SPEAKER_00]: and and I don't mean this in a negative
way we become numb to the day-to-day and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is why people generally tend to
benefit I'm gonna say emotionally
[SPEAKER_00]: psychologically from taking a trip and
when I say a trip I'm not talking
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily about taking you know a
psychedelic trip okay I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling somewhere you know going
someplace that you haven't been before
[SPEAKER_00]: some places you've been a long time ago
that you really enjoyed or going someplace
[SPEAKER_00]: completely new and having some new
experience and meeting some new people
[SPEAKER_00]: okay it broadens your perspective well the
adage trip doesn't necessarily have to
[SPEAKER_00]: apply to travel or just to psychedelics
okay you know we're talking about tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about cannabis talking about
a wide range of things changing your state
[SPEAKER_00]: of mind is really the goal and when we're
in a very familiar environment changing
[SPEAKER_00]: our state of mind is actually harder to do
because we're in a very familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that has an effect on who we
are what we're doing what we're thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: what our choices are all this stuff and it
engages different parts of our brain in
[SPEAKER_00]: our thought process versus when we force
ourselves to get out of our comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: environment well things are functioning
differently right it just changes
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and you know same situation
where we're talking about earlier about
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing the strains well it changes things
up and I think anyone that's had a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of experience with cannabis will tell
you that changing strains whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: after a day or after a week or even the
same day it matters I used to say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like a tolerance reset in a way well
whether you want to call it a reset or you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call it a shift I'm gonna
completely agree with you because when we
[SPEAKER_00]: think what's really going on when we
consume a different strain well of course
[SPEAKER_00]: the active compounds the ones that
everyone knows about they're all there
[SPEAKER_00]: okay the other compounds whether we call
them synergy or synergistic or you know
[SPEAKER_00]: entourage whatever terms you want to use
the reality is the effect that it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to do a comparison personally if you
if you're interested you know go to your
[SPEAKER_00]: local supplier right and get yourself a
cartridge that's 90 plus percent THC okay
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you don't have a high tolerance
well I want to caution you but just take a
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny tiny tiny little hit okay and write
it out okay and then take a hit of just
[SPEAKER_00]: some raw flour and just do a comparison
and what you're gonna find is it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: not the same it's not just THC that
contributes to what the overall experience
[SPEAKER_00]: is it certainly has a role there's no
question okay but it's not the only thing
[SPEAKER_00]: not even close and it's not even just the
compounds that are the only thing it's
[SPEAKER_00]: your state of mind it's your location it's
what's going on in your world it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: people you're around right I guess with
that in mind I wanted to quickly ask you
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes I talk to people and they say I
want to get more of like a sativary effect
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm just gonna do the tip or I'm just
gonna vape at low temperatures I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: try to avoid getting some of those other
sort of CBN type compounds that maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: know bit sedating do you feel that you can
actually achieve that in the in the
[SPEAKER_01]: DynaVap or do you think like it's it's
hard to sort of fractionally distillate it
[SPEAKER_00]: to an extent oh I would actually say it's
extremely easy okay and I would say that
[SPEAKER_00]: because who's in control right the the
person applying the heat is in control and
[SPEAKER_00]: since we've got an analog device that
analog device provides the person that's
[SPEAKER_00]: using it with the opportunity to really
get familiar with it and get comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and understand it like they do
their favorite razor when they're shaving
[SPEAKER_00]: their face okay their favorite writing
utensil when they're writing a letter
[SPEAKER_00]: their favorite paintbrush right when
they're trying to add the detail to their
[SPEAKER_00]: painting okay or whatever that tool might
happen to be you get familiar with it so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can really make your experience almost
to a tee exactly what you want it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: okay because you're in control it's I
think almost that simple yeah you can take
[SPEAKER_00]: that light terpy tasty rip okay or you can
heat the base and go to space and all from
[SPEAKER_01]: the same strain yeah and that's that's
something that's good to hear because that
[SPEAKER_01]: was my suspicions because I I feel like
you know I mentioned a bit earlier I love
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the sativas and I think that that's
one of the versatility of the unit you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you can almost take any strain and to
an extent coax out a more sativa rich sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of expression of what you've got you know
it's obviously not gonna turn a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent indica into a hundred percent
sativa but you can try to push it a bit in
[SPEAKER_00]: that direction well it allows for what I
would refer to is a much more in-depth
[SPEAKER_00]: exploration of what each strain has to
offer and when we're when we're using the
[SPEAKER_00]: small size of our chamber to do little
tasty rips right well how fun is this when
[SPEAKER_00]: we can just micro dose a tiny little bit
do a low temperature extraction put it
[SPEAKER_00]: down and if we happen to be one of those
exceptional people that has more than one
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamap we can have another one loaded up
with a different strain and whether it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: few minutes later an hour later we can
pick that up do a little tasty rip and hmm
[SPEAKER_00]: wow interesting and and really compare
those differences and then at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time you can heat a little bit lower and
do a much more thorough extraction and
[SPEAKER_00]: really enjoy how nice and soft the couch
is and having kitty on your lap is just
[SPEAKER_01]: fantastic right now yeah I can get down
with that in one of the previous answers
[SPEAKER_01]: you you mentioned you know go out grab a
cart see how it goes I wanted to ask you
[SPEAKER_01]: about the rise of pens in the market and
specifically about the younger generation
[SPEAKER_01]: who just seem to be really quite locked in
to sort of vape card and associated type
[SPEAKER_01]: products you know they're all sort of
similar right from my point of view and
[SPEAKER_01]: the young people I've spoken to it seems
to be primarily driven by convenience yes
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that many of the convenience like
you know the ability to have it quite
[SPEAKER_01]: discreetly and it's small and you can use
it really quickly like as you've discussed
[SPEAKER_01]: they're they're all like the Venn diagram
is pretty big with Dynavap so I wonder
[SPEAKER_01]: what's your thoughts on how we can maybe
try to get some of these people over to
[SPEAKER_01]: experiencing the flower because my concern
is that there's a whole younger generation
[SPEAKER_01]: of people who haven't got to experience
the what I consider to be a slightly more
[SPEAKER_01]: nuanced experience of each strain when you
get to consume the flower versus just a
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a highly refined end product okay
well so there's there's a couple things
[SPEAKER_00]: that come to mind there the first one is
of course the convenience plays a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: factor in this okay but it's not all bad
because it is nice because especially for
[SPEAKER_00]: some people depending on how you're wired
or if you're contending with some other
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstances having a quick easy discrete
access to even if it's a bit more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: refined extract can actually be very
impactful in a positive way to that
[SPEAKER_00]: person's quality of life okay and the
other good part of this is I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: noticing that some of the pens are really
starting to get into the range of having
[SPEAKER_00]: much higher quality and much more
full-bodied extracts that aren't just 94%
[SPEAKER_00]: THC with just enough other things to keep
it liquid right it's not all about how
[SPEAKER_00]: high can I get how quickly no it's because
the people that really care about what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on have come to the conclusion I
think quite accurately that it's not just
[SPEAKER_00]: about THC it's about providing an overall
more balanced experience and I've even
[SPEAKER_00]: seen just recently some carts now that
have are starting to push the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: boundary limit of actual THC it's dropping
down into the 20% range which is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide an experience that's much more on
par with flower because you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: find flower that has your THC content in
the 20% range so there's some good options
[SPEAKER_00]: that are there and are becoming a bit more
prominent but for people that have never
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced the real power of just raw
unadulterated flower well here's another
[SPEAKER_00]: goal for us as a company to make that kind
of experience accessible because our goal
[SPEAKER_00]: is to have very inexpensive yet high
quality durable products that are very
[SPEAKER_00]: approachable and easy for people to
acquire without having to make a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: commitment without having to have a huge
learning curve and so that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: experience what it's like to you know bake
their cookies just right you know respect
[SPEAKER_00]: the click have that experience right and
it doesn't have to come from batteries and
[SPEAKER_00]: be kind of in control of it and I find
that there's even some applicability for
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that get a little bit of
satisfaction from the fidget spinners for
[SPEAKER_00]: example right we make product that it fits
in that category it's it's fun to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's got a little fidget ability to
it it doesn't take up a lot of space it
[SPEAKER_00]: fits in your hand and at the same time
it's a tool that you can use likely for
[SPEAKER_00]: decades to kind of fill that gap in your
life and and then and then finally the
[SPEAKER_00]: carts super convenient you know these
disposable vaporizers and whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to call them a lot of laws going in
place because of the all the batteries and
[SPEAKER_00]: electronics and everything else going in
the landfill our company has the very
[SPEAKER_00]: opposite approach and it has from the very
beginning let's let's see where the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: boundary is how durable a product can we
actually make you can we make a product
[SPEAKER_00]: that literally is generational I mean how
cool is that right and a product that
[SPEAKER_00]: brings the ritual back from the
convenience while not being inconvenient I
[SPEAKER_01]: love that I love the fidget spinner sort
of analogy it definitely makes sense and
[SPEAKER_01]: and the idea of making this you know
essentially sort of indestructible item
[SPEAKER_01]: you got me thinking has anyone ever
contacted you guys and like sent you in
[SPEAKER_01]: like a haggard little unit and they're
like I swear to God this is just wear and
[SPEAKER_01]: tear I haven't run over it with my car
like because I have to imagine the answer
[SPEAKER_01]: is probably no like no one's ever actually
legitimately broken it through wear and
[SPEAKER_00]: tear well it has happened occasionally you
know there have been a few people that
[SPEAKER_00]: have run over with the car and the one in
particular and this was years back I think
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017 you know shortly after we launched
the M you know they sent pictures ran over
[SPEAKER_00]: the car and all they were asking for was a
new cap because it was kind of dented from
[SPEAKER_00]: the tire actually pressing the cap in
between the fins right it didn't damage
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else there's a few nick marks
from you know from the the cement you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know the metal being run over by
the car so he sent him a new cap and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that was cool so that and it's not to
say that our products don't break okay
[SPEAKER_00]: they can break they may break you know a
lot of them still have o-rings right they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't last forever but they don't cost
very much and they're not hard to replace
[SPEAKER_00]: and and here you got all these individual
parts of our products that are easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: take apart easy to clean easy to
reassemble and just easy for the consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: to maintain and if necessary do a little
bit of repair work and that I think
[SPEAKER_00]: actually contributes at least from what I
read in a very positive way to the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: experience of owning the product that hey
you know what today I'm gonna clean some
[SPEAKER_00]: of my Dyna map devices okay and that leads
into another really fun thing that maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: some people still don't know about right
and that is we already know that using
[SPEAKER_00]: Dynavap products can stretch your stash
significantly just from the consuming and
[SPEAKER_00]: inhaling those compounds for the effect
that you're looking for well secondary to
[SPEAKER_00]: that is whatever is left in your chamber
when you're done can be saved and is now
[SPEAKER_00]: decarbed and can be consumed at will and
will give you whatever you didn't inhale
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be able to consume it that way and
you'll get that effect so we get an
[SPEAKER_00]: additional multiplier well there's a third
multiplier that is actually I think one of
[SPEAKER_00]: my favorites and that is what is usually
referred to as a stem milk but I think a
[SPEAKER_00]: better way for to describe it is it's more
like tip and condenser you know tea or
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee right and you just make yourself a
good hot cup of coffee or tea definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: on the hot side you know close to boiling
is good you don't even necessarily have to
[SPEAKER_00]: put the tea in at first okay but you do
put your tip in your condenser right in
[SPEAKER_00]: that hot water okay pour in a little bit
of good quality creamer the creamer is key
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really important because now you've
got this homogenized fat that all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: good things that have condensed in your
condenser or in left over in your tip
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna dissolve or diffuse into
that hot water and creamer mixture and now
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a liquid edible that tastes like
coffee or tea that well at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: now just cleaned your device when it's all
done you just rinse off your condenser and
[SPEAKER_00]: tip with some hot water and you clean your
device you got a drinkable edible Wow we
[SPEAKER_00]: just made things another level more
efficient I wanted to ask you exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: about this which was what is your
recommendation for the ABV because a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people differ and you know do you do I
read about the the water cure which
[SPEAKER_01]: apparently can make it a bit better what's
your sort of recommendations on what
[SPEAKER_01]: people can do with that because I I
certainly myself have accumulated a bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: it oh boy you know it I find that to be
such a personal preference thing because
[SPEAKER_00]: some people accumulate a fair bit some
people don't accumulate much at all and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one of those things well do you
accumulate a little bit or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: accumulate a lot well that creates two
different paths now second to that is do
[SPEAKER_00]: you like edibles or do you not because
some people really don't like that effect
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's very different when it goes
you know down the hatch versus you know
[SPEAKER_00]: through the lungs and if you're not a big
fan of that effect well then maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: fall in that category where well when I'm
done if I'm going to save it I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: save it for someone else or if you don't
really accumulate very much well then when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're done it just goes back into the
environment and that's okay too so
[SPEAKER_00]: personal preference thing and one you know
fun little plug I wanted to make here when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using a product that lasts for
decades or longer and your input is
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing but raw flour well your net impact
on the environment is no different than if
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant that you're just consuming had
grown in nature finished its life cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: tipped over and hit the ground and got
reabsorbed back into nature you know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no paper there's no filters
there's no tips there's no plastic there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no metal there's no batteries there's no
other stuff it's just raw extracted flour
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah that's actually an interesting sort
of thought I hadn't crossed my mind oh I
[SPEAKER_00]: like that and it you know it's not even
it's not even burned you know as if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: coming through a bowl or a joint you know
an ash it's just like as if the plant had
[SPEAKER_01]: grown and got old and dried out and died
sure you know I like that I'm gonna think
[SPEAKER_01]: about that for a bit I I wanted to follow
up on one of the things we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about in our last episode which was you
were talking about the dinocoa which is
[SPEAKER_01]: super cool for anyone who likes
concentrates and we had a few guests who
[SPEAKER_01]: they were stoked about how you were
talking about like making the little balls
[SPEAKER_01]: and putting it around the tip of it is
like a cool way to sort of smoke some hash
[SPEAKER_01]: in the dynavap are you able to put like bh
o and sauce and stuff on the dinocoil okay
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad you brought that up so the
diet calls not been around I think since
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019 so it's five years right we're
actually investigating you know some
[SPEAKER_00]: updates for it because I think it's it's
about due it was one of those things that
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we would have maybe updated it
sooner but the reality is it just
[SPEAKER_00]: generally works except for those people
that it doesn't work and I'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: address that because well understood
because kind of like dynavap okay it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: intuitive out the gate because it's not
like lighting a one-hitter in the regard
[SPEAKER_00]: that people intuitively know how to use a
one-hitter quickly okay because the steps
[SPEAKER_00]: are very simple and there's not many okay
when it comes to using a dyna coil how do
[SPEAKER_00]: you consume it well maybe a banger right
take a dab maybe try and wipe a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: on a rolling paper right there they're not
the easiest to really use well but the way
[SPEAKER_00]: people use them they see the dyna coil
well that use it like you take a dab you
[SPEAKER_00]: take you stick your dab tool in there you
grab a glob of it you wipe it on there you
[SPEAKER_00]: put the cap on you heat it up right well
that's how I thought it was gonna be and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I come to find after doing a little
bit more experimentation that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: when the bee came out in 2022 it went up
on the website and I was reading through
[SPEAKER_00]: the product description I was like wait a
minute why does it say in the product
[SPEAKER_00]: description it's not compatible the dyna
coil and it's like well I was told well
[SPEAKER_00]: the chamber is not as deep as a regular
tip so it doesn't fit like okay that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's intuitive put the cap on and the
cap still fit but now it's sticking out
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like well hmm it got me thinking is
like you know there's something here and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can remember then taking that bee with the
dyna coil in it sticking out the end is
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know one of the worst things
about using concentrates is everything
[SPEAKER_00]: gets sticky it's just annoying right and
you got to have a dab tool and it's hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to use good quality concentrates on the go
because you got to have a place to set
[SPEAKER_00]: things down and go through your ritual to
do it right and I was like wait a minute
[SPEAKER_00]: if I take a bee okay or now my current
favorite is an m7 okay because I'll push
[SPEAKER_00]: the screen into the half position for an
m7 and put a dyna coil in it again so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking out like it would be in the tip
of a bee the dyna bat bee then you take
[SPEAKER_00]: your lighter or your induction heater and
you heat up your tip for enough time to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it hot enough that it'll melt the
concentrate okay so usually if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using a torch it's gonna be five to ten
seconds get it hot not not super hot but
[SPEAKER_00]: hot and this allows you to now take your
device and dip that dyna coil into your
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates vertically okay so now your
device becomes the dab tool okay the dyna
[SPEAKER_00]: coil is now hot and so what it does is it
melts the concentrate and this allows that
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate to then wick into the dyna
coil using capillary action and a magical
[SPEAKER_00]: thing happens okay just like you can't
soak up five gallons of water with one
[SPEAKER_00]: paper towel it hits a point of saturation
where no matter how much water is around
[SPEAKER_00]: it it won't soak up anymore okay well the
dyna coil will only soak up as much
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate as it can hold period when
it's hot okay versus when you use a dab
[SPEAKER_00]: tool and you smear a glob on there you can
put as much on there as it'll fit okay and
[SPEAKER_00]: then when you heat it up whatever it can't
hold melts and runs through and makes a
[SPEAKER_00]: sticky mess so here it is several years
after introducing the dyna coil I come to
[SPEAKER_00]: the realization that hmm I've been telling
people to use this thing in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: just doesn't work as good as if you stick
it in your tip with the screen up or use a
[SPEAKER_00]: b-tip that's smaller so that coils
actually sticking out preheat your tip so
[SPEAKER_00]: that your coil is hot enough to melt your
concentrates dip it in your concentrate it
[SPEAKER_00]: will load the same amount of concentrate
every single time I mean it becomes this
[SPEAKER_00]: super accurate dosing mechanism and it
doesn't overload and then on top of that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you put your cap back on it and then
you then heat up to the click well you've
[SPEAKER_00]: already preheated your tip so you're not
going from a cold start and it makes for a
[SPEAKER_01]: really really nice experience I love that
and yeah I can just imagine doing it you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it almost makes me imagine that
you're turning your unit into like a
[SPEAKER_01]: paintbrush you know like you're loading it
up the way that little bit of residual
[SPEAKER_00]: paint sits in there yes that's a good way
to describe it there you go well look I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna have to give that a go I wanted to
ask you you know since we last spoke
[SPEAKER_01]: there's actually been a few new models
released and I took a look at the the
[SPEAKER_01]: website last night just to make sure I was
up to date and I know that like the xv4 is
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly a newer one along with the m5
you mentioned also the hyperdyne a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier maybe you know can you give us a
bit of a rundown on some of these new guys
[SPEAKER_00]: and why you might lean towards one of them
the the X is it's kind of a fun one
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's actually an M that we made
back in 2021 okay it's not something that
[SPEAKER_00]: we made recently we just have some stock
left over from some of those early
[SPEAKER_00]: production runs and we've been really kind
of growing in terms of our our ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: change the way our products look because
we've developed some equipment and some
[SPEAKER_00]: process that allows us to create new
colors new surface finishes new textures
[SPEAKER_00]: on the products and so we've been
experimenting with some of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: and we found that some of the some of the
product that didn't get sold back in 2021
[SPEAKER_00]: 2022 2023 the only reason wasn't sold was
not because it wasn't functional was
[SPEAKER_00]: because it had sometimes some cosmetic
issues okay we like to sell good quality
[SPEAKER_00]: product we want that customer to have a
good experience with it we want them to be
[SPEAKER_00]: happy that they purchased it and we want
it to look the part that they think it
[SPEAKER_00]: should well with some of this new
equipment that we've built we can take
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these older products and we can
give them new life we can give them colors
[SPEAKER_00]: that just simply weren't available when
those products were originally sold which
[SPEAKER_00]: is really kind of fun and we can even make
them feel different which is also super
[SPEAKER_00]: fun so that's kind of what the the x
series is now hyperdyne takes that to a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole new level because the hyperdyne is
our is our first large capacity product
[SPEAKER_00]: where we took the volume of the extraction
chamber and more than doubled it because
[SPEAKER_00]: if there is one bit of feedback that we
would consistently get from people in our
[SPEAKER_00]: community is when are you going to make a
bigger product and for years I resisted
[SPEAKER_00]: but it got to a point a few years back
where it's like okay why am I resisting
[SPEAKER_00]: this if people really want it no it's not
just because they don't know who's the
[SPEAKER_00]: product they are just looking for more and
for people that actually smoke a fair bit
[SPEAKER_00]: the tiny little chamber on a Dynavap just
isn't going to get them what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for or to qualify it isn't going
to get them what they're looking for until
[SPEAKER_00]: they've developed a little bit different
level of skill and familiarity with the
[SPEAKER_00]: product because it just that's how that
product works right when you really know
[SPEAKER_00]: the product it's amazing what you can get
out of that tiny little chamber right when
[SPEAKER_00]: you know how to operate and you understand
the nuance okay so we made a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: product and it took a little while to
develop because we didn't want to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: corners with it and one of those hard
things to figure out for us was the cap
[SPEAKER_00]: right you know the cap on all of our
devices prior to this was you know made
[SPEAKER_00]: out of stainless steel very thin metal
kind of springy so it was easy to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: cap to literally push on but yet stay on
and be adjustable and also fit across a
[SPEAKER_00]: broad range of different tips that are
slightly different shapes and sizes now
[SPEAKER_00]: how are we going to do that if we need to
make a bigger cap if we want to make that
[SPEAKER_00]: cap out of titanium how are we going to do
that we're gonna make it go and it took a
[SPEAKER_00]: few tries it took some real head scratch
and to find they figure out that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what even though the cap on hyperdyne is
literally machined out of one piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: titanium we can make it click onto the
hyper tip just like a standard captive cap
[SPEAKER_00]: will click on almost any of our other
devices and we did that by engineering
[SPEAKER_00]: what they call a compliant mechanism into
that titanium cap and even though it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't move or bend or flex much it's
just enough that it'll just click right on
[SPEAKER_00]: and it stays on the tip without the need
for any threads or any other kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: retention so just kind of fun stuff and of
course the hyperdyne is also our our first
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of full-scale product that features
what we call our our duradine finishing
[SPEAKER_00]: right really really hard very scratch
resistant interesting color options that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can create with this finish process
that takes a material like titanium which
[SPEAKER_00]: in contrast to what most people think
although titanium is a relatively strong
[SPEAKER_00]: material compared to say aluminum it's
actually a relatively soft material
[SPEAKER_00]: especially compared to steel okay so if
you buy a material or a product that's
[SPEAKER_00]: made from titanium or has titanium parts
that are visible or touchable what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna find is that they scratch really
easily if you polish it yeah you can
[SPEAKER_00]: polish it nice but it's gonna scratch well
we can put our duradine finish on there
[SPEAKER_00]: and now you've got a all titanium product
that I'm not gonna say it's scratch proof
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's close that's that's brilliant the
best of both worlds you know it's got that
[SPEAKER_01]: cool look and the improved durability so
that's that's really exciting to hear yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fun we get some colors too right the
the first color we released the hyperdyne
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of a really nice kind of dark
grayish black color really resonates with
[SPEAKER_00]: people got a nice glossy sheen to it but
there's more colors coming for sure I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that you're right like there's so
many cool colors that affect the cosmetics
[SPEAKER_01]: of it that can play into why people are
interested and I'm so glad you guys are
[SPEAKER_01]: exploring it I love the color the original
the original one I got was the the the
[SPEAKER_01]: rosium I love that sort of beautiful
magenta re blue purple right up my alley
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my favorite colors and now the
rosium is not a color that we currently do
[SPEAKER_00]: in-house because it is colored through a
coating process called PVD which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: really fascinating process super durable
when it's done properly reasonably
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature resistant fact and we put it
even on the caps and especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: people use induction heaters for the caps
it holds up really really well I mean I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen examples of some of the first rosium
devices that we released which geez is
[SPEAKER_00]: that all the way back to 2019 or 20 they
still in good shape holds up good the we
[SPEAKER_00]: brought back rosium this year on the m7
and the rosium m7 is by far and away my
[SPEAKER_00]: absolute favorite of all the rosium m's
we've ever made you know because now what
[SPEAKER_00]: we have we have the m7 as a stainless
steel device has one of our kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: signature textures on the stem okay it's a
really interesting texture that plays in
[SPEAKER_00]: the light in a really neat way just as a
raw stainless steel product when we put
[SPEAKER_00]: that rosium PVD coating on there now it
takes up a whole nother level because now
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't really have color but you have a
color shift depending on your viewing
[SPEAKER_00]: angle and it's just so fun to look at and
to watch where just by tipping it one
[SPEAKER_00]: direction versus the other the color of
the product will shift from gold to to
[SPEAKER_00]: magenta to bluish purple or green and it's
the same product in the same color I love
[SPEAKER_01]: it it's it's super super cool the the
other product I wanted to quickly ask you
[SPEAKER_01]: about before we look to wrap things up was
the the bong adapter you know this one
[SPEAKER_01]: seems like a no-brainer to me especially
because like I have so many people who
[SPEAKER_01]: message me because I'm so vocal you know
like I got off combustion I got off bongs
[SPEAKER_01]: and I feel like it's a bit of a no-brainer
but I wonder is that what you would
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend for people looking to make the
transition or what would you recommend oh
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's it's such a good product for
that because it doesn't cost very much you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's one of our least expensive
pieces or devices especially if you buy it
[SPEAKER_00]: as a functional unit it's also very short
and compact so it it mates really well
[SPEAKER_00]: with your with your water tools without
being long and in sticking out and just
[SPEAKER_00]: being a little bit unruly okay but it can
also be used as if it was kind of a little
[SPEAKER_00]: short fat blunt too so it's kind of a
really versatile product and I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: also worth mentioning here that to kind of
type back to say the hyperdine okay we're
[SPEAKER_00]: just talking about when we were collecting
input from the community right and some
[SPEAKER_00]: you know customers and people within the
company terms okay we want to make a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger capacity product right well not
only how big should it be but what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: key other elements that that product
should have and one of those key elements
[SPEAKER_00]: that just came up again and again in these
conversations in these surveys is make it
[SPEAKER_00]: backwards compatible with your other
products like okay not quite sure how
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna do that but that's a really
important thing and it's understandable
[SPEAKER_00]: that's important especially for people
that have more than one DynaVap device
[SPEAKER_00]: which you don't need more than one because
it should last a really really long time
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're finding that even though we make
products that generally don't break people
[SPEAKER_00]: tend to buy more than one because
collecting is kind of fun and you get to
[SPEAKER_00]: have different experiences with them they
look different they feel different they
[SPEAKER_00]: perform different to your stainless tips
your titanium tips your XL length long
[SPEAKER_00]: devices or your little short length ones I
don't know if you've even seen we had one
[SPEAKER_00]: we released back this fall called the mini
wind that the whole device is the same
[SPEAKER_00]: length or if you take the tip off and set
it next to the device they're the same
[SPEAKER_00]: length okay it's tiny tiny little thing
right it disappears in your hand but
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just part of that versatility of
what we like to call the Dynaverse right
[SPEAKER_00]: so just just fun stuff and so to circle
back to the bonger right you can buy just
[SPEAKER_00]: a hyper tip which is what we call the
larger diameter larger chamber tip for the
[SPEAKER_00]: hyperdyne and because the components of
the hyperdyne are backwards compatible
[SPEAKER_00]: with almost every device that we've made
since we began as a company you can mix
[SPEAKER_00]: and match those parts just like you can so
many of the other parts and you can put a
[SPEAKER_00]: hyper tip on a bonger and you can get a
really powerful experience which really
[SPEAKER_00]: helps get through that somewhat
challenging transition as we're moving
[SPEAKER_01]: from combustion to thermal extraction
totally I love it and I agree with the
[SPEAKER_01]: sentiment there which is that like it's
really just that transitionary period that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be a little bit sticky for some people
and once you get through that you'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: like man this is this hits just just like
what I wanted from the combustion and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: never going back so I love that a lot the
final question I wanted to ask you for
[SPEAKER_01]: this one is you got anything fun in the
pipeline you might be willing to share
[SPEAKER_00]: with us even if it's just a dream oh my
gosh no no no I absolutely do in fact I
[SPEAKER_00]: even have some of it sitting right here
next to me you got actually got two things
[SPEAKER_00]: right so the first one we actually just
released very recently I don't if you've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen it yet or not have you seen this
thing oh I think I saw it on the side okay
[SPEAKER_00]: so we now have available a gravity powered
water tool that comes in its own little
[SPEAKER_00]: kit right okay and what's really funny
about this is it works with just about any
[SPEAKER_00]: available bottle that you happen to have
okay so put on a couple little extensions
[SPEAKER_00]: here and I can take a beer bottle plug it
in I can take another beer bottle put on
[SPEAKER_00]: top okay I can take this a hyper tip off
of one of my devices and I can plug that
[SPEAKER_00]: right in right and if I want I can grab my
little whip right out of my kit I can plug
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the other side I can heat up my
tip built clicks and then I guess flip
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing over and it'll fill right up
and it'll do all the work for you and when
[SPEAKER_00]: when I flip it back it'll just simply blow
it right in your face or it's really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: to share at parties because no one has to
put anything in their mouth yeah wow so it
[SPEAKER_01]: just creates a gravity bong out of nowhere
in Australia we call it the bucket bong
[SPEAKER_01]: but it just you just whip it out with two
bottles it comes in this cute little case
[SPEAKER_01]: right and I think it's just super fun oh
yeah anyone who remembers the hits from
[SPEAKER_00]: those bad boys it is super fun indeed so
there's that also coming next year is the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dyna pen okay I mean we've all heard
people talk about the vape pen right but
[SPEAKER_00]: most people don't sign their checks with
their vape pen but with this one you can
[SPEAKER_00]: right I mean it's an adapter that will fit
into just about any Dyna Vap stem that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have and it converts it into a pen because
we can and it's just one more way that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're expanding the Dynaverse I love that
so much and I think it's super fun for
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have a collection of Dyna Vap
products well now you can pull the
[SPEAKER_00]: mouthpiece off of one end or the tip off
of the other end because you'll need
[SPEAKER_00]: really one you can put this pen insider on
there and you can take it with you to work
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can be literally working with your
Dyna Vap using it as a pen or mechanical
[SPEAKER_00]: pencil or what have you and someone might
walk by like well that's a really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool-looking pen is like yeah and you only
know the half of it but the reality is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's legitimately a pen because it can be
so why not that is absolutely incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you saved that for the end
hopefully you post it up and people can
[SPEAKER_00]: jump on board if they can yeah that's
that's what that's what the game plan is
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're we're putting some of the
preliminary things in place now and well I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know about you but I like to be kind
of an optimistic person anyway I'm really
[SPEAKER_00]: excited for what's to come I think there's
some really good positive things starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to come together I think it's gonna be a
good year here here I'm with you let's
[SPEAKER_01]: make it happen let's do that so I think
with that it just about brings us to the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of it were there any comments or shout
outs you wanted to make well what's your
[SPEAKER_00]: kitty cat's name Jean that's Jean yeah
that's fantastic yeah she's awake it just
[SPEAKER_00]: it just makes me smile you know I got a
few kitty cats at home and my wife does
[SPEAKER_00]: some work for a rescue and will foster and
you know some here and there and help them
[SPEAKER_01]: get new homes it just it's a nice thing to
see oh yeah I'm a heavy cat man I got I
[SPEAKER_01]: got three of them and we we love our
feline counterparts oh they're they're fun
[SPEAKER_00]: but no in terms of shout outs the probably
the most important thing for me to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: to just show a little bit of gratitude for
you know first off the people that I work
[SPEAKER_00]: with for for really sticking around
putting up with me because I know I can be
[SPEAKER_00]: a challenging person at times even though
believe it or not I'm actually not trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to be challenging I'm actually just trying
to do the best that I can to help everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: get what they're looking for out of life
you know I've got some really good
[SPEAKER_00]: business partners and you know of course
my family who I really wasn't sure at
[SPEAKER_00]: first you know when I started down this
path you know whether or not they would
[SPEAKER_00]: you know think less of me for doing it
because you know the the world is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: divided on on some of these matters but
they've actually been really supportive
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know I'm very thankful and
grateful that I'm able to go after kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: what's been my dream to not only create
and make things and hopefully make the
[SPEAKER_00]: world a better place but to hopefully
empower more people around the world to
[SPEAKER_00]: make choices that help them live more of
the life that they're looking for and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that's something that brings me joy
that that's awesome to hear and like an
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible thing to be grateful for so I
think that's beautiful man that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really awesome so with that a big thank
