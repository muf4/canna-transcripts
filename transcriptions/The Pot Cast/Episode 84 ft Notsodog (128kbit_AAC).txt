[SPEAKER_03]: And on this episode we are joined by an
absolutely notorious man in the scene,
[SPEAKER_03]: the originator of the Mendo Perbs and one
of the hosts of the incredible Breeders
[SPEAKER_03]: Syndicate podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: A big warm welcome to Notzodog for joining
us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing my friend?
[SPEAKER_03]: A long time coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is been a long time coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is good to chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you been smoking on?
[SPEAKER_00]: What have I, I actually have been smoking
on a plethora of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a little like a little Breeders
Syndicate gathering not that long ago and
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a ton of samples from friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually mostly smoking on a bunch
of good friends weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream, Trainwreck, Death Star,
Loompa's Headband, some Sour Diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: some weird Sativas from Bodhi.
[SPEAKER_00]: A bunch of good stuff actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much, much more variety than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been, it's been welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like a beautiful smorgasbord.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a bunch of stuff I want to ask
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess first thing that comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was like the most standout from all
the things you tried?
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't that, like not necessarily unique
or maybe it is unique, but what just has
[SPEAKER_03]: left a really lasting impression on you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, it's, it's, people are going
to laugh, but I really enjoyed my buddy
[SPEAKER_00]: Pac's Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, you know, some strains get a bad name
because they get overproduced or they get
[SPEAKER_00]: grown like for on commercial levels and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason why it got popular in the
first place was like grown well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, the Blue Dream was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: His Trainwreck was also really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both were like very classic and took me
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my buddy High and Lonesome,
his Shoreline, which is like very 90s to
[SPEAKER_00]: me type of, type of weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there was just some really nice
cushions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some really cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some weird sativas there and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like, I almost enjoy the weed more
when I'm home because when you try to have
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of gathering like that,
I don't know about you, but like once you
[SPEAKER_00]: start smoking six, seven, eight,
nine, 10, 12 kinds of weed in short
[SPEAKER_00]: duration, you sort of like lose the
ability to like generate what you think of
[SPEAKER_00]: each individual one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts to become like a haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, you know, when I'm home,
I could take a couple of bong hits or
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke half a joint of something and then
start like, you know, doing some chores or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, and I'll get a real good sense
of like what kind of journey that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that herb takes me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you can do that over some time
and you can kind of look at each
[SPEAKER_00]: individual one without it being like,
uh, you know, one on top of the other,
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of the other, on top of the other,
because once you're in sort of like a weed
[SPEAKER_00]: festival event like that, it's mostly what
you, you notice what tastes good and what
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts through the other ones.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's certainly a cumulative effect,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, but yeah, I mean, it, it was nice
that we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, we, we used to do it,
you know, I mean, uh, you went to one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you went to a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we used to do it around the Emerald
cup in Santa Rosa just because everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: was gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so we would have these,
you know, get togethers, we'd run a house
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'd have some get togethers at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people could come and just shoot the
shit and, and enjoy themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then COVID kind of put a lid on that,
um, for a few years, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then this, uh, winter, we pulled off
like a very small family-based one where
[SPEAKER_00]: just a bunch of friends brought,
you know, we just cooked and ate and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and smoked and chatted for a couple of
days and it was super nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, I remember the event in,
um, I think it was actually 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was able to come to that last one before
COVID hit and definitely a who's who
[SPEAKER_03]: event.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, uh, even myself who admittedly,
I don't get quite as starstruck as I used
[SPEAKER_03]: to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember being at that party and every
time I turned my head, I would be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, that's such and such,
you know, that's rude boy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just, just people you weren't
expecting to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess it brings up an interesting
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of people, including,
you know, some of the real heady guys feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like the Emerald cup is not really what it
used to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think these small scale events are
like the way forward?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would say that, um, they've always
sort of been there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so the difference, the difference
obviously is like the Emerald cup is,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a commercial style event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's obviously going to change with
like the rules and regulations and what
[SPEAKER_00]: they allow and what they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The party that I was just describing is,
is more of like a traditional in my mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: like harvest festival where it's sort of
invite only, uh, and, uh, it's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just basically like a gathering of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there used to be a guy,
um, he's still around, uh, that would
[SPEAKER_00]: throw a very similar kind of, uh,
of gathering, um, at his house 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, 20, a couple of years, 22 years ago,
something like that, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and he would rent, um, a nice,
a really nice house in Healdsburg,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, uh, in Northern Sonoma County
and just have a bunch of friends gather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually where I first met,
uh, CSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's where I first met, uh,
chip from, uh, Royal gold, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: although he didn't have Royal gold back
then I met Shaw, Shaw bud there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and then you talk to old
timers and stuff and there's been harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: festivals going on since the seventies and
eighties in Mendo and Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I would classify that one as sort
of like a, just an informal gathering of
[SPEAKER_00]: friends where you have food and drink and
smoke and you just basically chat and get
[SPEAKER_00]: a chance to, uh, to hang out a bit where
the Emerald cup is sort of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a commercial event, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean it can't be cool because
you're still gathering a bunch of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, two 15, the medical era was
sort of like, uh, a lot of those harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: festivals like Emerald cup was sort of
like a gray area swap meet in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that you could rent a booth and you could
kind of do whatever you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could sell that you could sell weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could sell weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could sell t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could sell stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could advertise your farm,
all these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all you needed was, you know,
a little bit of tax work and, and some,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and some money and, and a medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that, uh, now that it's fully
legal and regulated, um, everything has to
[SPEAKER_00]: fit into those rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the people and a lot of the
activities that used to go on at Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: cup no longer fit within the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it changes it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to loop back on that point,
but I want to ask you about a few of the
[SPEAKER_03]: strains because you, you know,
you, you just mentioned like some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: all time greats in what you were able to
sample while you were there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd love to loop back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned your friend, you know,
brought some amazing train wrecks,
[SPEAKER_03]: some blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that, um, Santa Cruz goat farmer?
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've only just recently because of,
you know, yourself and Matt, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: been sort of put onto him and I love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, I say this very
regularly, but like, I think if you live
[SPEAKER_03]: outside of America, it's maybe not an
obvious point, but like the rest of the
[SPEAKER_03]: world is not burnt out on Jack Harrah on
blue dream on train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're all still very much like
yourself enjoying what is arguably some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the best genetics out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you find yourself personally ever
getting burnt out on those strains or was
[SPEAKER_03]: it more just the community?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so there's, there's a couple
of ways to look at it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, uh, whenever anything becomes a
big deal and train wreck is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: important because it was like one of the
first named clones to really get grown and
[SPEAKER_00]: humbled by a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so what happens is in a lot of
times is that these strains for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, they get popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a demand for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: People start growing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: People start growing more of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the beginning, most of it is
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as more and more people get into
it and they go, go bigger and bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like it gets, the quality gets,
gets not as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting some like eight pound outdoor
blue dream, uh, that was grown
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially might not be very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people are going to be
encountering blue dream in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but getting like a little two,
three, four ounce indoor plant grown with
[SPEAKER_00]: love or a greenhouse plant grown with love
by your buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you probably will see the qualities
that led it to be popular in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most of these things, whether it's
train wreck or, um, blue dream or grape
[SPEAKER_00]: ape or Urkel or, uh, you know,
um, granddaddy purple or OG or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, go through the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, they have their moment in the
sun and then it becomes easier to move
[SPEAKER_00]: something else for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the market shifts, but it doesn't mean
that that strain is any less nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just means there's something that's
easier for people to move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then, you know, people go with
what, uh, with what, what the craze is,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, in the probably oh four, oh five,
oh six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say every indoor grower in
Helmbolt and Mendo for the most part was
[SPEAKER_00]: probably bumping out some kind of purple
because the market just had an insane
[SPEAKER_00]: insatiable demand for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that's where granddaddy purple and
Urkel and Mendo P and all those things
[SPEAKER_00]: became kind of famous, uh, because they
went, they went easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They went for top dollar and then 98% of
people dropped them when the sour and Kush
[SPEAKER_00]: era hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a bunch of people dropped sour
and Kush when the Skittles, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie era hit and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the purple era came back,
uh, the last three, four years in
[SPEAKER_00]: California, but instead of being those
classic strains, it was hybrids of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, it was gelato or this or
that, or, you know, it's not purple
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, I think that most people don't
want to hold onto any, any strain that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not currently making money off of
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and so as a result of that,
you know, there are strains that are very
[SPEAKER_00]: popular, that tons and tons of people had
at one point that either become law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lost or only ended up holding in a few
hands because people had to hold onto it
[SPEAKER_00]: when it wasn't popular or wasn't popping
because they cared about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happens over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, it really does.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely goes in cycles, doesn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, to give some kudos to,
uh, the Santa Cruz goat farmer,
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to know, you know,
you've got a vast experience growing a
[SPEAKER_03]: range of different strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm sure even if you haven't grown any
of them specifically, you'd have a good
[SPEAKER_03]: idea out of the sort of train wreck lines
he's put out, which one sort of grabs your
[SPEAKER_03]: eye.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that impressed me the most and
people will laugh, but is, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: he had a train wreck blue dream hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that people have a hard
time with a train wreck, um, is because
[SPEAKER_00]: long before we knew or use the word
terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We would, we would try to associate tastes
and smells with like certain strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you know, it has that strong,
you know, turpentine that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, people back in the day used to
be like, Oh, it's got those train wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that train wreck nose or it's got
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that Jack Herrera nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and now we know that that's
turpentine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and turpentine is can be a really
sharp, really astringent, uh, flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has, I would say it's one of the
more controversial, uh, aromas in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, uh, because some people really
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a large percentage of people
that dislike it very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it elicits strong opinions,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he's got this train wreck blue dream
where the sweetness and the softness of
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue dream really mutes a lot of that
astringent sharpness that comes from the
[SPEAKER_00]: train wreck side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can still taste the turpentine,
but it's way more sweet and way more on
[SPEAKER_00]: the backend instead of just being like,
you know, uh, lemon cleaner sprayed in
[SPEAKER_00]: your mouth or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't, it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you, if you ask CSI, you ask Matt,
or you ask various readers, it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to mute turpentine, which is why
people get frustrated with it because it
[SPEAKER_00]: is such a sharp forward astringent flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so I was pretty impressed by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, generally speaking,
uh, various people are going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: different favorites in the community and
they're going to have different things
[SPEAKER_00]: that they gravitate towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's things that I have that I love
intensely that other friends of mine don't
[SPEAKER_00]: like very much, even though they
acknowledge it's really good weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not their preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so people like, uh, pack, you know,
holding on to train wreck and blue dream
[SPEAKER_00]: and some other classics because they love
them and they, and they, they want to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: them safe and they want to keep them
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then they grow them with love and
care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's good weed usually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I remember just when you were
talking about, you know, people getting
[SPEAKER_03]: sick of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember a quote I heard from Tom Hill
when I was with him, he took a smell of a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain bud and he was like, ah,
train wreck where all flavor profiles go
[SPEAKER_03]: to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I remember that highlighted the
point, but just, uh, to ask a sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: related question to this, aside when you
were listing those strains, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: blue dream train wreck, maybe even like,
you know, Calio and skunk.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we stepped away from those towards
say the more cookies and Skittles era,
[SPEAKER_03]: you helped me to realize in the moment
that some of these more popular strains
[SPEAKER_03]: were definitely more hybrid, maybe even a
little sativa leaning at times.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've sort of moved a lot more towards
Indica leaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you say that's coincidental or do
you think as a community, as a whole of a
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer base, people are sort of just
more inclined to Indica's than Sativa's?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's accidental.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, um, you know, uh, so there's a
couple of ways to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you, when you're, when things were
primarily outdoor, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, first of all, like most of America
started on Sativa because that was,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got free Sativa seeds in the weed that
you bought because the weed was from
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand or it was from Columbia or it was
from Mexico or it was from wherever,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, where everything was Sativa in the
beginning, because that was the access
[SPEAKER_00]: that you had.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got, uh, Indica's, it was hashish,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that didn't come with seeds,
um, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sativa's were way more prevalent in the
country at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the, especially in the sixties and
seventies, um, it was primarily all people
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, in the early to mid
seventies, there was some like very small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of people, like maybe like Steve
Murphy up in the Pacific Northwest or
[SPEAKER_00]: different little groups that started
having a little bit of Indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, I think like old timers and
friends of mine that have like lived in
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt their whole life, like CSI have
told me that they, you know, it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: late seventies is when it started first
really spreading around Mendo and
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to realize you're starting with
almost a hundred percent Sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the late seventies and
eighties, people start injecting some,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, some Indica into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fast forward a bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to grow outdoor in the
sun, you'd way rather grow some sour
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel or some blue dream or something
like that, uh, versus like runs because
[SPEAKER_00]: that Sativa stretch, that ability,
like, you know, most things that yield big
[SPEAKER_00]: have to get big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to get big, you have to have
a certain amount of stretch and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a certain amount of structure
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so growing some squat little Indica
that's only going to get three or four
[SPEAKER_00]: feet tall, isn't going to do very many
people very much good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what people started doing is they try
to, they started trying to blend the two
[SPEAKER_00]: things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, can I get the high and the flavor
from the Sativa and the structure and the
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch, but can I get those dense buds on
the Indica and have it finish in the
[SPEAKER_00]: climate that I'm in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really the start of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I think with Instagram and with
pictures and all that, and with the way
[SPEAKER_00]: hype works, um, you know, most,
most stuff gets popular and it has very
[SPEAKER_00]: little to do with its growth rate or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of whether or not it just
catches a fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it has this time in the sun for a
minute, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't say it's, it's, it's more
like a conscious thing where people prefer
[SPEAKER_00]: because I would, I would say that the vast
majority of people smoking today probably
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't smoked real train wreck or real
blue dream or real Urkel or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: real Trinity or real things that were
popular 20, 25 years ago, just because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a long time ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can be smoking gelatos and runs and
cookies and this and that it's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: what is popular is what's accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, can you get it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's in, in a way it's like,
I don't know, I don't know if people's
[SPEAKER_00]: preferences are what they are,
or it's just what people's access is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's a huge point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely really try to echo to people
in Australia that, you know, even just
[SPEAKER_03]: your ability to even rate weed in the
grand scale of things is very much defined
[SPEAKER_03]: by what your exposure is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you've never had a truly elite
clone, can you really say one of your
[SPEAKER_03]: clones is truly elite?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I try to talk to people about
this and it's a difficult concept for
[SPEAKER_03]: sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get too far deep though,
I want to quickly ask you though,
[SPEAKER_03]: do you think then based on sort of what
you were just saying, that it is possible
[SPEAKER_03]: that maybe we could get a real sativary
sort of strain to become popular?
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause like that's my dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've, I've totally become like this
diehard sativa head and I really want to
[SPEAKER_03]: share it with other people, but it feels
like such an uphill battle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it got me to the point of where I'm
like, is it, is it just me?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like maybe I just like sativa
and like most people don't, but I guess
[SPEAKER_03]: based on what you're saying, like these
days, it's a bit more about catching fire
[SPEAKER_03]: and the photogenicness of the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it is possible?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hundred percent possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so if you, if you were to go back
and you were to think about how weed is
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Before medical really existed,
it was all private dealers and you would
[SPEAKER_00]: have to go and, and you get maybe however
many dealers you knew, you had to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out what they had access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was all you could get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very much like when you were
coming up and what kind of connections you
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as, as medical came in and stores
opened, you can actually go in and look
[SPEAKER_00]: and buy a wider variety of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those store owners weren't trying to
provide the widest, you know, categories
[SPEAKER_00]: for their customer base that they could
and educate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were trying to buy nice weed for
cheap so they could make a big margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that still happens to today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, there's not like, um,
you know, there's things that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe could be popular if you,
but you have to actually like,
[SPEAKER_00]: how are you going to get ahold of them?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not that easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you were to walk into,
I don't know how many, when you were
[SPEAKER_00]: visiting here, I don't know how many
dispensaries you walked into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, getting pure sativa is
not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can't get it, how are you going
to know if you like it or not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I have to be honest,
you know, it was actually a bit of a sad
[SPEAKER_03]: site to be seen and the three or four
dispensaries I did visit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, uh, I picked up some connected
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: They offered a strain cord high rise,
you know, and, and they're one of the
[SPEAKER_03]: companies that's touted as doing a bit of
a better job than most.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, Ted seems to be like a
passionate guy, so happy to support him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I tried this bud and, and I honestly
thought the turf profile on it was mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't think the bud was moldy,
but it smelled like mold.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so off putting and definitely
wasn't a sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was the only thing I could find
that was a sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I sort of thought, man, am I seeing
like the dying remnants of, of
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd love to get your take in general,
you know, what's your thoughts when you
[SPEAKER_03]: walk into the average dispensary?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it different to mine?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it similar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that it's, I mean, I, it's pretty
political, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I get, I would say that,
um, the reason why you were probably
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty disappointed is because over the
course of the last number of years where
[SPEAKER_00]: you've talked, you know, on this podcast,
you've been able to talk to a wide variety
[SPEAKER_00]: of people that love weed, um, and that
have some pretty nice collections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've been able to probably try and
smoke a bunch of those people's herb,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And friends of theirs herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sort of starts informing your
palette and what you like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go into a dispensary,
which is, is it, you go from labor of love
[SPEAKER_00]: to capitalistic and that's a big drop,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's even been a drop in quality from
the medical era to the legal era.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but strangely, uh, legalization might
be the only time that they've taken a
[SPEAKER_00]: black market product and made it worse and
more expensive than it was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous, in the previous situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because in, in the two 15 era,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To give you an example, if you had a
medical card and you were growing medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, what you were supposed to do
with it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was sell it to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that was the legal outlet to get
to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could obviously have your own
patient network or whatever, and pass out
[SPEAKER_00]: free cannabis and all that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like that's, that's how the system was
supposed to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result of that, you didn't have to
have like, basically I could grow a 12
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter in my garage, for instance,
and harvest that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with my medical card,
go down to people I knew in various
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries and you could buy that weed
directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dispensaries were able to get a lot of
different people's herb, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you didn't have to have a big
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have to have regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't have to pay all this money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You literally had to have a medical card
and you could do a dope deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Southern California, there was this
enormous train of people that would come
[SPEAKER_00]: up to Humboldt and Mendo and Sonoma and up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And buy indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they would take it down to the,
to the, to the Bay or take it down to
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern California, to San Diego or LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would sell that indoor for a
premium to the dispensaries down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result of that, you know,
there was still a wide variety of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of good and bad, but there was some
really, really, really good growers that
[SPEAKER_00]: their weed was, was getting dried right
and cured right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and a week later, somebody is buying
it a dispensary and it was really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with all the layers of
legalization and the commercialization,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, um, that most legal weed is a
lot closer to what we would, I would call
[SPEAKER_00]: Beasters than it was the best of the two
15 era.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and actually Beasters from Canada,
you know, do you know what I mean when I
[SPEAKER_00]: say Beasters, obviously?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Beasters for people that don't know is
in the nineties when you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada loosened up a bit before America
did and people started growing large
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts of commercial indoor, uh,
and then, you know, shipping it for higher
[SPEAKER_00]: prices and smuggling it into America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was sort of America's first
taste of like warehouse grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: large scale commercial indoor that was
kind of grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that modern legal is much
closer to that than it is some somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, knows eight or 10 or 12 or
15 lighter, um, doing a really good job
[SPEAKER_00]: and caring for their, for their weed in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything you just said is, is really
bang on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I w I will preface, you know,
I don't want to hold the dispensaries to
[SPEAKER_03]: too high of a standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a, it's going to be hard to keep up
with, you know, some of the, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: the people whose weed I've been fortunate
enough to try, but exactly what you said,
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember I was able to come over for one
trip before outright legalization
[SPEAKER_03]: occurred.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember I, um, the first dispensary
I went to was in Colorado and I got some
[SPEAKER_03]: admittedly, like even by today's
standards, some really nice gorilla glue
[SPEAKER_03]: and, uh, some nice forum cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remembered and it was what you said,
you know, it obviously had come from
[SPEAKER_03]: someone's small hobby grow in nearby that
dispensary who'd put a lot of love into
[SPEAKER_03]: that grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could really see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I guess to have seen that
progressively sort of slide downhill is,
[SPEAKER_03]: is more the sort of part that's a bit of a
bummer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It raises the question, do you think the
current system will ever allow for really
[SPEAKER_03]: high quality weed to exist or just the
scale at which you have to operate to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to exist in the legal climate is like
sort of prohibitive in a sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it will.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a necessarily a timeframe for
it, but it absolutely will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have, I have faith in that part of
it just simply because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I'll put it to you a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, when I was younger, um,
it was basically hippies that were
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in fully organic and a higher
grade of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there would be these very small,
like crunchy, like co-ops and stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: had specialty foods and organic apples and
this and that and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what really made organic food
like available in America and every
[SPEAKER_00]: grocery store and what blew up whole
foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these big, big companies is
there was a bunch of wealthy people that
[SPEAKER_00]: were like, you know, I drive a European
sports car and I have Italian leather
[SPEAKER_00]: boots and I get my suits tailored and I'm
shopping at the same grocery store as
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't there a higher grade of food I can
buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't there nicer stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't there like a better grade?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was, and so it was really like
hippies sort of like, um, coalesced
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a bunch of like back to nature
people and stuff, but it was sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: a very niche thing for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it went mainstream and now you
can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most, most big chain grocery stores have
an organic section, you know, some places,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, large organic stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the same thing will happen
with weed is that right now we're just in
[SPEAKER_00]: that first legalization where they're
like, okay, here, you should just be
[SPEAKER_00]: happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the quality kind of sucks,
but eventually what's going to happen is
[SPEAKER_00]: quality is going to matter just like in
lots of other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to start to see people
willing to pay more for certain things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the market is going to have to get
educated on what's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't exactly know how long that's
going to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I can't really say that it's like
around the corner or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just looking at how other economic
stuff in America works, I see no reason
[SPEAKER_00]: why there shouldn't be everything from
kind of crappy weed, but it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable for people and really high end
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sativa's stuff that yields tiny stuff
that, but has a really great effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone's willing to pay through the
nose, um, for something that took 16 weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: and didn't yield very much because it's
that good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting because it does raise
this point that I've spoken to a few
[SPEAKER_03]: people about, but not notably,
I remember a conversation I had with Bodhi
[SPEAKER_03]: where he sort of said, you know,
you do get a lot of people, especially
[SPEAKER_03]: online, who will really throw out their
support for this sort of stuff and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, if you grow this 16 week plan,
I'll pay for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, sadly you sort of find that
when push comes to shove and you've got
[SPEAKER_03]: the product there and ready to take
orders, you know, the, the fanfare can
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes dry up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, I think this is not a new
sentiment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It exists in probably a lot of industries,
but like hopefully, you know, eventually
[SPEAKER_03]: people do really sort of, um, you know,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_03]: They pay with their wallet, they vote with
their wallet and, uh, we can get some of
[SPEAKER_03]: those Sativas back, especially with the
advent of people like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom, who wants to put out this,
you know, mythical Hayes clone that he
[SPEAKER_03]: finds, you know, maybe, maybe that'll
kickstart at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I will say that on a, on a
negative note that I've never been more
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about the diversity and weed than
I am right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that while I do think that those
kinds of markets could develop over time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be really important for
people to hold on to as much of what they
[SPEAKER_00]: have during this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really is rough for a lot of people
because before, and you know, and I'm,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that I have, I have a pretty big
collection of, of old strains that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I, it's very idiosyncratic
to me because it's not like I had this
[SPEAKER_00]: idea that like, Oh, I'm just going to hold
onto all this special stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day it's going to be like,
it's going to be rare and important or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically just was willing to,
because I lived in Mendo and I had space,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, if I like this plant,
I'm going to hold onto it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the collection is very much based upon
my preferences and, but that it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive and it's time consuming and it's
a huge pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be funded by something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when times were a little easier,
some of these large collections and some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these various things, and some of these
sativas you're talking about, some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that's unpopular, it has to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise later on, people might not have
access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because it, you know,
it can't be everybody else's
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility to hold on to stuff that's
unpopular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until it's needed again, because that's
how every conversation you've ever had
[SPEAKER_00]: about what happened to that strain comes
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Roadkill skunk definitely jumps to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the nineties, skunk turps
were very, were very prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that, you know, there's analogues
of it, I think, sour diesel and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's various plants out there
that have elements of it, but in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: of that pure, rank like skunk spray,
it's kind of become a little bit of a lost
[SPEAKER_00]: turp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I was talking earlier on the
show, literally every indoor grower I knew
[SPEAKER_00]: in 04, 05, 06 ran some purple when it was
super popular and demand was high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it turned into sour diesel Kush
time, 99.9% of the people dropped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few people like CSI and a couple
others here and there, a few rare people
[SPEAKER_00]: held it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it went from everywhere to almost
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, you know, as you can well
imagine, imagine having, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 moms or 80 moms or 120 moms,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and trying to keep those things alive
and healthy and cloning them and starting
[SPEAKER_00]: them over and growing them up and getting
them healthy and then cloning them and
[SPEAKER_00]: starting them over, because obviously they
get too big and like what kind of facility
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably should have in order to like
keep all this incredibly important history
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, and, you know, uh, DNA alive and
mostly it's being done in garages.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it does raise an interesting point
because the question comes to mind,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, how do you compensate
someone for that effort?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you sit down and do the math
on it, a lot of physical hours of labor,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then, you know, you can factor in
electricity costs, mediums, all that sort
[SPEAKER_03]: of nutritional nutrient, and not
everyone's necessarily a breeder,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, not everyone can necessarily
just bang out a seed line with these old
[SPEAKER_03]: strains and get compensated for hanging
onto them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it does sort of raise this question
of like, how do you think as a community,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can thank the preservationists like
yourself, who maybe don't have a seed
[SPEAKER_03]: company or don't have one yet,
maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, how, how, yeah, what,
how can we pay them back besides just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a verbal thank you, which is
obvious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, the real issue for me is
rather than getting any kind of praise or
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks, you know, uh, the more important
part, we would just be making sure that a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these things just stay alive so
that future, like, you know, future
[SPEAKER_00]: generations can have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even necessarily mean future
generations, like 50 years from now,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking like eight years from now,
five years from now, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, cause once it's gone, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, as, as I'm sure, because you've
talked to a lot of people by this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when you get into Kush and you
get into sour diesel and you get into all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different things that maybe became
popular in the nineties, it's really hard
[SPEAKER_00]: to figure out even just 20 years later,
exactly what happened or what cut is the
[SPEAKER_00]: right cut or what is this or that or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I think that when, when it comes
down to it, different people that are,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are collectors figure out different
ways to make money so they can keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I think is it's, it's mostly
the people that hold onto things,
[SPEAKER_00]: not entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but for the most part, they do so out
of love, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, and different people might
love different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they might be more inclined to hold
onto these things than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have like a diverse group
of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were talking again about my buddy
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he loved that train wreck and that
blue dream enough that he's held them
[SPEAKER_00]: since he first got them in Humboldt a
million years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or think of some people like Bodhi you
were talking about that have some,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that have some rare Sativas or
some other friends that might have some
[SPEAKER_00]: rare Indicas or, you know, CSI that has,
you know, or myself or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep naming different folks, but you know,
whether it's a seed company or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: else, a lot of these people, they hold
onto it at the core because they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up sharing it with people that
you also hope will keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the frustrating thing about
trying to hold onto a collection is some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the stuff people will be like,
Oh, you're a hoarder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these things like the headband
or different things I've shared with
[SPEAKER_00]: friends so many different times it's
unbelievable, but most people don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to hold onto them unless it's like
currently popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everybody, everybody wants fire,
sour diesel when sour diesel is popular,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what happens when, you know,
like the market shifts to purple or the
[SPEAKER_00]: market shifts to this or the market shifts
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to hold on to the thing that's
unpopular and it's going to take up space
[SPEAKER_00]: and time in their growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not so much like, um,
it's not so much the credit part that I
[SPEAKER_00]: give a shit about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's more about like, um, that,
that kind of stuff surviving because who
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to be in a world, and this isn't a
diss against gelato, but who wants to be
[SPEAKER_00]: in a world where like 95% of the,
of the cuts are gelato cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: kushments, or, you know, some kind of
popular thing within the last three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't want to pigeonhole yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, and you know, you even know
like from like, from a genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective, there could be stuff in some
of these old strains that we don't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know how valuable it is for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be, there could be mold
resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be bug resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be valuable stuff besides the
fact that it's cool wheat and that you
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy smoking it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just sort of to relate back to a
topic you just touched on, like when we're
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about people who hold on to
strains that are really special,
[SPEAKER_03]: I do remember, uh, in one of the early,
must've been 2016 Emerald Cups I went to,
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a nug of Trinity off you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remembered distinctly when I,
when I smoked it thinking, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, this is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's not like modern strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just remember thinking it's very skunky
and very hash-y.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was sort of the, the lasting
impression I got from it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to hear your rundown on the
Trinity and sort of the backstory from
[SPEAKER_03]: your perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it pretty leafy?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I gave you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it might've been outdoor
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the Trinity is a pretty cool
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll leave out some names,
but the basic story is that there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: guy in the glass blowing scene from
Eugene, uh, in Oregon area, and he,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, traded some glass for some weed and,
um, ended up there finding, finding seed
[SPEAKER_00]: and it popped and there's a, there's a
group up in, up in Oregon that it sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: started to spread through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I first started coming out to
the West coast, um, as a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a hippie kid, I would hit events like,
um, reggae on the river, uh, in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I would go see, you know, Jerry band
shows, uh, in the Bay or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started going to see, uh, Oregon country
fair, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Oregon country fair is, um,
you know, it's sort of like, it definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: is a, is a very old school hippie
gathering that goes on right outside of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of those people that are involved
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started making friends up there
and most of my friends up there were
[SPEAKER_00]: growing things like the, the snow,
the Trinity, um, uh, a different super
[SPEAKER_00]: skunk, um, you know, some various,
various things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was kind of a strain I was
familiar with because most of my,
[SPEAKER_00]: like most of my friends that I was making
up there then had it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all we knew about it was it was bag
seed from Trinity County in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then through a variety of situations
that went on, almost everybody lost it
[SPEAKER_00]: from the late nineties to the early two
thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just one of those name strains
that was just gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kept trying to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I found it and someone
would give it to me, I would grow it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it wouldn't be what I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people would be like, and I'd have to
tell them it's a fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fast forward literally like 15 years or
something, 10, 12 years, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we CSI and another friend I won't name
up in Humboldt, um, and a guy in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe we stumbled upon this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get it back and I grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe there was a, there was a bad
fire that year, the first year I had it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that those outdoor plants really
went through hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I had this jar and I started
showing it to various friends of mine and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone got real excited and thought it
was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it, it's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next year I grew it and it
didn't go through hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't get beat up by the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no fires and it came out way
nicer and way chunkier in all honesty than
[SPEAKER_00]: the previous year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about half of my friends that
didn't jive with their memory anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, now I'm not sure it's
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have a group of people that
some of them think it's absolutely it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of them think maybe it's it,
or maybe it's like an S one or maybe it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a close relative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it goes to show in my mind is
that even if you're an, even if you had
[SPEAKER_00]: something back in the day, even if you
grew it any number of times, like how good
[SPEAKER_00]: is old memory?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because, you know, you have this thing
where it's like, whether it's the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how good is a 20 year old
memory?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be able to identify
something beyond a shadow of a doubt after
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple decades passed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you had it, you were in your early
twenties and you were taking a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelics and you were, you know,
a partying hippie and this and that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and your skill set was way different and
the growing style was probably different
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I deal with this with a lot of cuts
because people have gotten really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested into lineage and everyone wants
to claim that they have the real deal old
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it becomes difficult to ascertain and
people get into battles over whether or
[SPEAKER_00]: not it's real or whether or not it's
close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity is an example of that because it
sort of fell off the face of like people
[SPEAKER_00]: having it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes those strains can just exist
with one or two or three people in some
[SPEAKER_00]: little group that isn't online or isn't
connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the connected people,
something might be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, it's kind of the same thing
with like, uh, what happened with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: with that a five in Holland, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where for a long time people thought it
was lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they discovered that there was
this guy that had these sativas that
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville had gave them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them ended up being that a five
cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he just was tucked away doing his own
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Trinity, it seems like that's kind
of the case with it, where it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: tucked away and it hid, um, and it wasn't
being passed around very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm not going to sit here and say
it's 100% it because who am I to say so,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will say that even the people that
think it's not it think it's a very close
[SPEAKER_00]: relative or an S1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the weed itself, which is the
most important part is actually liking the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fully.
[SPEAKER_03]: And admittedly, I think I had heard
someone say that, uh, they thought it
[SPEAKER_03]: might've been Trinity Cross Blueberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing that I thought when I heard
that was what makes you say blueberry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, as in like, was there to your
recollection, was there a clone of Trinity
[SPEAKER_03]: Cross Blueberry that also went around?
[SPEAKER_00]: There, there was, there was some,
there was some accidental breedings with
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity and there was a few intentional
stuff that was done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and I, I don't, I can't
really say about the original Trinity
[SPEAKER_00]: Blueberry, but I do have friends that
lived up there then and said that they got
[SPEAKER_00]: it, uh, semi often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do know that it existed, um,
what it looked like and how close it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't say, but I do think that that
Trinity cut that exists, I do think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really tasty smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's oily in a weird way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it burns really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really nice potent buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I would classify it as really good old
school, you know, where maybe it's not as
[SPEAKER_00]: visually appealing, you know, for today's
market, but in terms of like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it burns and how it smokes and how it
feels once you're smoking it, I am a big
[SPEAKER_00]: fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, look, as a follow-up, I'd love to
ask you, you often hear people say that
[SPEAKER_03]: the Humboldt Snow could be a sister to the
Trinity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd love to hear your thoughts on that
because I have been lucky enough to try
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt Snow many years ago, some
imported weed to Australia from what I
[SPEAKER_03]: believe, and my experience was a very
reputable connection in the States.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I don't have too much reason
to doubt it wasn't real, but from my
[SPEAKER_03]: memory, it was a very different plant to
the sort of nug of Trinity I got from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to hear your thoughts,
you know, have you tried the Humboldt
[SPEAKER_03]: Snow?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think there is any relation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, I have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's a good story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and it, and it, it, it really goes to
show how different crews can call things
[SPEAKER_00]: different names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I was saying before,
that same group of friends that I met at
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon Country Fair that were growing the
Trinity, they also grew the snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to them, uh, it was Eugene Snow or
Oregon Snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they called it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and to them it was from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you got it in Humboldt, uh,
like CSI got it, it was Humboldt Snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got it in Eugene, it was probably
Eugene Snow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it actually, I know the people,
um, there was, I won't say their names,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there was a boyfriend girlfriend who
drove out from Florida to Oregon with that
[SPEAKER_00]: cut in their car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Florida, it was called the Skunk
Five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that cut is gone from Skunk Five to
Snow, Eugene Snow, Oregon Snow,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Humboldt Snow, just depending on who
you got it from and where you got it and
[SPEAKER_00]: what era you got it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: What a life it's lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just kind of one of those things
where it's like, I mean, you can talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about, there's a bunch of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to get off on a big tangent,
but you know, I'm sure some people back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day called the puck, the hash plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people then called it the puck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some people called it the Skelly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some people called it the Skelly
hash plan.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and you get different groups
that'll argue with each other over like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the name and what's the bullshit
name that came later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's just because cannabis
groups are kind of isolated from each
[SPEAKER_00]: other until the internet and the forums
came around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we're, we're good at
giving things nicknames.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes names take a life of
their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you got Snow and Humboldt,
it was probably, I mean, I think CSI,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember and I'm going to butcher
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but he would, he would drive the snow
up to Portland back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would take it as some totally
different name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I didn't mention like soup or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to ask him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to misspeak because it's not
popping into my head, but it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like the guy that he gave it to
sold it totally under some different name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was incredibly popular under that
name in the Portland area in the late
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties, early two thousands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's definitely not, not related
to the Trinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that you can say that it's
related from is it came from the same
[SPEAKER_00]: general smoking, glass blowing,
grateful debt, hippie circles in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the commonality.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the commonality that like it's
spread from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So often people would, would probably see
people that had both.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Trinity came from Trinity County and
uh, snow came from Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Worlds apart almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to, to loop back to one more
strain you mentioned earlier before we,
[SPEAKER_03]: we stopped lingering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I could honestly talk about these
all day, but you mentioned you got to try
[SPEAKER_03]: the shoreline skunk from, uh, high and
lonesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had grew out a shoreline skunk S1
many, many years ago, back when I was not
[SPEAKER_03]: very enlightened about cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just sort of, you know, stumbling my
way through seed banks and, uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: this one was from the devil's harvest
crew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've come to learn a bit more
information about those guys as time has
[SPEAKER_03]: gone by and sort of, you get mixed reviews
about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes a negative, but this plant I
grew from them was very interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it's truly one of the most
memorable terpene profiles I've ever
[SPEAKER_03]: smelled.
[SPEAKER_03]: A very metallic sort of skunk aroma.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thoughts on the shoreline?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's going to make a
comeback?
[SPEAKER_03]: And does the real clone have that sort of
metallic aspect to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it has a bit of a metallic taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I am definitely not the shoreline
expert by any means, uh, because I am a
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very, I, you know, I only even
really tried it recently, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's kind of interesting
because, you know, I, you have a,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a wide variety of friends all over
the country and various places,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it doesn't mean even though you might
talk to them a lot about various stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you get to try all their weed all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and especially like for some of these
clone holders or Bodhi or CSI or this or
[SPEAKER_00]: that, it's not like these guys are growing
out just rooms of headstache so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can try.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the real thing, but like most of
the time when they're growing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're breeding with it or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's not only, it's not like there's
like plethora of flour floating around of
[SPEAKER_00]: all these rarities all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, shoreline seems to come out of
Texas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's spread around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much nineties weed and that just
the way that it looks, it definitely seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like it has some kind of skunk with
something else in it aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's one of those things that it's
been something that high and lonesome has
[SPEAKER_00]: held onto for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sort of spread it around our friend
group a bit and, um, it, people really
[SPEAKER_00]: like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one of the aspects that, that happened
in the last 15 years, is that all these
[SPEAKER_00]: things that happened in terms of
popularity, every time a strain got
[SPEAKER_00]: popular, everyone crossed everything to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that has OG in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that has cookie in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that has Skittles
or Cushman's or, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or sour or, or diesels or this or that or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of these older things that had
their heyday before that mixing,
[SPEAKER_00]: they sort of stand alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they give you a really good idea of
how diverse weed used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because before like the internet and
before popularity and before like waves of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff started happening, there used to be
a lot less weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so almost all weed sold, which meant
that a lot of diverse and nice weed would
[SPEAKER_00]: stick around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most named clones have been really bad for
diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say, yeah, that's an interesting
take.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what happens is, is like,
and I'll, and I'll go back to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about it a bunch, but I'll go
back to like, let's say it's oh four and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're having a hard time selling your
ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your neighbor is like, dude,
I've got this purple Urkel and I swear to
[SPEAKER_00]: God, if I give you cuts, my guy will take
every bit that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that guy stops growing what he was
growing and he grows the Urkel cause it's
[SPEAKER_00]: easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that works.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Urkel lessons in popularity and
sour diesel becomes big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that guy gets sour diesel and drops
the Urkel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he finds out that Kush is going
for crazy digits and he gets a Kush and he
[SPEAKER_00]: drops the diesel and he grows some Kush
and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but what was that guy growing before
the purple Urkel?
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fully it's a, it's sort of an endless
cycle, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, so what's happened in the last
say 20, 15 or 20 years as named strains
[SPEAKER_00]: have become really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've dominated what people breed with
and they've dominated what's been on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times it ends up being the
same 30 to 40 cuts all blended together in
[SPEAKER_00]: these different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And things like Trinity and things like
snow and things like shoreline that we
[SPEAKER_00]: just mentioned, or, you know, they all tie
back to that previous era before that
[SPEAKER_00]: really started happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, you can see a
lot of things that have a certain sameness
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go back to before that
started happening and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, that's shoreline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a different thing to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a different buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got this different kind of flavor
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's neat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, so there's been
positives to like popularity, but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: also negatives as far as diversity goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was going to ask you this
question later, but it feels like it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: good spot to sort of put it in,
but.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to sort of get your take on like,
how do you, how do you sort of reconcile
[SPEAKER_03]: the differences between current popularity
versus older popularity?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess I'm thinking specifically in
terms of like the zeitgeist and maybe to
[SPEAKER_03]: give you an example, let's say in the
early 2000s, C99, NL5 haze were being
[SPEAKER_03]: grown by everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super, super popular strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you talk to people nowadays about
like what's the real heady strains from
[SPEAKER_03]: back then they wish they had.
[SPEAKER_03]: They rarely ever mention either of those
two.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, maybe things like the
puck and things that weren't necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: the talk of the town at the time,
but retrospectively, we're really
[SPEAKER_03]: interested in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I guess I'm wondering, you know,
do you think if we look at the current
[SPEAKER_03]: situation and the current popular strains,
you know, is Cushmints, is Skittles?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think in 10, 20 years time,
people will be looking back being like,
[SPEAKER_03]: man, I wish I had them or will it be some
more niche thing that maybe flies a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: under the radar at the moment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it's I mean, it's always
hard to predict the future, but I can talk
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit about the differences because they
are real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in the day in the 90s or in the
early 2000s or, you know, maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: through like before Instagram and social
media really, really kicked off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that, you know, most of the
what we would call elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, it's not like everyone thought it was
elite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that like enough people enjoyed
it, that it gained a reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so like most elites, whether they
whether you want to call it, whether the
[SPEAKER_00]: puck or the NL five Hayes or the what we
would call the Chem 91 these days or the
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush or sour diesel, they gained
popularity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gained a group of people that thought
it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that started to spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the more it spread, more people
agreed with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it became desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so most elites happened
organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where today, modern marketing has been
very much so hit cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no burner in the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean by that is like there was
no hype people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no professional photographers
like making the weed look incredible with
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect lighting, you know, and rotating
the bud on this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can see now or now that you
have legal cannabis, everybody needs
[SPEAKER_00]: elites and everybody needs fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to sell you something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a result of that, you have a bunch
of people pushing a bunch of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to be elite because they want to
make new money and they want it to be new
[SPEAKER_00]: hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's because it's not being developed
really or organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them don't have the staying power
that the ones of old do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine, you know, and so I think a lot of
those old elites, they've they've said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they stood the test of time and
but even even still, some of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: like some of the older ones, like I think
maybe their best use is breeding material
[SPEAKER_00]: these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I am not even a fan of
everything that's old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I think the the pucks, children are
and grandchildren are on average quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit nicer than the puck itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the puck is valuable because it
comes from the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whatever the genetics are that tie
into that ties into a very like pre pre
[SPEAKER_00]: era of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think that's important to
like put into modern genes and spread that
[SPEAKER_00]: around and keep that DNA going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it wouldn't it wouldn't be
in my jar of favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even though I think that some of the
hybrids that have been made with it are
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me let me quickly jump in and digress
for just two seconds.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to kill me if I don't
ask.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which of the puck hybrids would you be
into like puck meets new world indica
[SPEAKER_03]: meets new sativa?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what's the general combination that
would pique your curiosity?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I you know, I I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think blending puck into different
indicas and then using those in whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: way you want is probably the best way to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the puck is I mean, compared to
most modern things, you probably agree
[SPEAKER_00]: with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The puck is pretty ugly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not very frosty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't visually have what most people
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had for me, it's basically like I would
consider it like an indoor strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't like being out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't like the sun very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time I was able to get it to do
well in the sun is if I shaded it even
[SPEAKER_00]: more so than like in a greenhouse,
I had to shade it again, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, if it's from the late 80s,
like whatever genetics, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: it ties to those genetics are worth
keeping around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And spreading into things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, there's various people
that have done some work with the puck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that kind of thing is a little bit of
a labor of love because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: cookies and some of these different things
like the puck doesn't have most of what
[SPEAKER_00]: the modern consumer wants in wheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's slow growing and it's ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like even people, you know,
that have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like those people are bumping out
rooms of puck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, that's that's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people don't have access to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good that it's being bred with
because, like I said before, who knows how
[SPEAKER_00]: important the genes in it are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely ties, you know,
before Kush, before sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_00]: before cookie, before a lot of these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to keep some of those
old genes percolating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I was going to go for some old
school like 80s weed, I think the NL5
[SPEAKER_00]: hazes that have existed from that era are
way nicer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pot as far as like my personal smoke than
puck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, look, I have to agree with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that you've said it, it makes me
realize, you know, it's very rare that
[SPEAKER_03]: someone actually has a bud of the puck to
offer me, you know, and I've probably more
[SPEAKER_03]: often been offered a hybrid, which makes
sense, given everything we just said.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just mentioned NL5 haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to ask you, you know,
a lot of people have been talking
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically in the context of you about
the PNW dogshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's an NL5 haze?
[SPEAKER_03]: Give us the lowdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll give you the the brief history
that I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that this is funny, too, because,
you know, when I when I do my when I do
[SPEAKER_00]: the chats or whatever, I try really hard
to talk about what I think I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like, what's my personal
subjective opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes that opinion gets people so
upset, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people are married to certain
stories or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and talking about weed and talking
about history can be a little dicey in
[SPEAKER_00]: that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to think that the the dogshit
was an old NL5 haze variety from the early
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I thought that was
basically the way it made me feel and the
[SPEAKER_00]: way it smelled and tasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: The history of it is a little muddled,
but it seems like it came in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It popped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Minneapolis or northern Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it was called Electric Boogaloo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it got brought out to Oregon and
it got changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to be misquoted here,
but I believe there was a guy that had it
[SPEAKER_00]: that had the cat piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he decided that the two strains he
was going to have was the cat piss and the
[SPEAKER_00]: dogshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he changes that he changes the name
from Electric Boogaloo to and I think even
[SPEAKER_00]: before Electric Boogaloo, my buddy was
telling me that at first they just called
[SPEAKER_00]: it the sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might have gone from the sativa to
Electric Boogaloo to dogshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll say for the record that Electric
Boogaloo is one of my all time favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally think it's like that's like
it's just an amazing, amazingly cool name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I and I definitely dislike and you
would never, ever in a million years in
[SPEAKER_00]: modern modern weed, name something the
dogshit because we're in like the dessert
[SPEAKER_00]: of Vogue images era.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, it is it up, I think,
by 93, 94, 95 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up in Oregon and select groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got its name got changed to
dogshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people that have it have it
through those connections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so dogshit it became.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have changed my mind on what I think
the dogshit is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll throw it out there that this is
absolutely pure speculation for me and has
[SPEAKER_00]: zero proof by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take it for what you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is, to me, a lot prettier than any
NL5 Haze phenol I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and, you know, NL5 Haze to me is like
the most successful hybrid ever made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's probably eight or 10 living
examples of it, even still today from the
[SPEAKER_00]: early 90s.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fives and C fives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's PIF.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, you know, the the the black
what some people call Cuban black.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different phenols of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of there's the cough from
Connecticut that ended up in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're blessed in that regard that
there's a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all to some degree kind of
ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grown well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the dogshit is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have this sneaking suspicion
because the only two things that Neville
[SPEAKER_00]: sold in that era, which is the late 80s
and early 90s and then at Sensei that had
[SPEAKER_00]: haze in it consistently was Silver Pearl
by Haze and NL5 Haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been leaning towards maybe the
it could have some it could be some
[SPEAKER_00]: silver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be some silver haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the photos, PIF posts of the pearl
he's got.
[SPEAKER_03]: They look really pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, Silver Pearl,
for people that don't know, is the NL5 cut
[SPEAKER_00]: cross to early Pearl and Skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what that's what Silver Pearl is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Neville took that and crossed
that to the same mail of haze that NL5 got
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those were his two haze offerings both
at the seed bank and at Sensei.
[SPEAKER_00]: They they were both sold for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it fits the timeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly like looking at all those
straight NL5 haze F1s like they just look
[SPEAKER_00]: a little uglier and a little weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that early Pearl and that Skunk
makes the the the you know, the dogshit
[SPEAKER_00]: look prettier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's certainly a little faster than
some of those other hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still get the effect and I still get
a very similar nose to what I consider NL5
[SPEAKER_00]: haze to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just much nicer looking weed and it's
a little faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the dogshit a whole bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say that my buddy Bittersweet
who I should mention the shoreline that I
[SPEAKER_00]: smoked at that party was actually from
him, even though it was through high and
[SPEAKER_00]: lonesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also brought some some electric
boogers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a party favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people that, you know, most heads
when they smoke it, they really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to be a fan favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a nice strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes 12 weeks, 13 weeks, maybe
something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes nice flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smells really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a really good uplifting,
energetic buzz makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty I almost call it like like old
school 90s weed in the sense that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like if you grow it right, it's very lime
green with this certain shade of hairs
[SPEAKER_00]: that just reminds me of getting like 90s
hydro hydro what I used to call hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got just this very cool old school
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an old favorite of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love for that one to become
ragingly popular because I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: deserves it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even even just to to represent the sativa
sort of side of the market a bit more.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to admit, I've never tried it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've you've really got me keen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to have to keep my ears and my
eyes open for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a it's a manageable sativa that
yields nice, that yields nice looking
[SPEAKER_00]: nuggets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take I mean, it takes,
like I said, 12, 13 weeks, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it it's really accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, most of my friends that have
grown it or tried it, it's become in their
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's one of those ones that
could be a lot more popular than it is if
[SPEAKER_00]: people had access to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to look for some hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was meant to ask you this last question,
but, you know, we're still sort of in that
[SPEAKER_03]: general talking point.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we were talking about, you know,
the park and the utility of like having
[SPEAKER_03]: those old world genetics being
incorporated into modern stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen even some of the more hype
guys talking about trying to make some
[SPEAKER_03]: hybrids like, you know, I'm talking like
Connected California and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris Compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear I've seen them talk about the dog
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe that'll work its way in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I wanted to ask you specifically
was I've been really excited by seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the work being done by full power
selections and the whole crew that Irizen
[SPEAKER_03]: is behind and working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the stuff they've been posting
about collecting from Afghanistan,
[SPEAKER_03]: Pakistan, India looks really phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wonder, do you think these modern
Afghanis will be able to inject some fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: blood into the genetics in the way that,
say, the puck did?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you think that it's like it's just
not the same?
[SPEAKER_03]: And even though it might look old world,
it's maybe not quite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so I could throw a couple of,
you know, let's put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a world where everything is GMO,
Cushmints, Gelato, Skittles, and Cush and
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations thereof, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding in genetics that are totally
different than that is very beneficial,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get too inbred on
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, working with land races, it can be
beneficial, but it's not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: universally beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it's going to suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just part of breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the part that people don't want to
accept is that breeding is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: failure, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most common things that
happened to people in the 80s when they
[SPEAKER_00]: first started breeding Sativas and Indicas
together on a more consistent basis was
[SPEAKER_00]: that they realized that a lot of these
Indicas that come from like this extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: dry, arid, cool climate in Afghanistan
rotted like crazy when bred into Sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the reasons why like certain
cuttings and certain lines became so
[SPEAKER_00]: prevalent in 80s and 90s cannabis for
Indicas was because it was actually really
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult for those old timers to find
Indicas that didn't screw up what they
[SPEAKER_00]: had, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a good thing and it's totally
different genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you work with land races,
whether it's Sativa or Indica from
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere, it's a lot of work at times to
get them to a level that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable to us, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing you got to
remember about these Indicas is that it
[SPEAKER_00]: took us some time because, you know,
Sativas are made to be smoked for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cultures we were getting it from
were growing it for smoke, whether it was
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexican or Colombian or Thai or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of these Indicas that are coming
from, say, some of these groups in
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan and Pakistan that are
collecting them, the plant itself is just
[SPEAKER_00]: the carrier for the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the carrier for the resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're and they're resin farmers,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care what it smokes like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care what the flower tastes
like or how it burns.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there to grow that plant and then
to extract the resin off it and to turn it
[SPEAKER_00]: into various kinds of hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so for for us who are
primarily flower smokers, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to convert that into our needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like they don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know if the flower tastes like
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're growing it in the Hindu
Kush mountains and it's bone dry there and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's arid and you take it to California or
Oregon or somewhere where it's more humid
[SPEAKER_00]: and it rots like crazy, you wouldn't even
see that in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's valuable what they're
doing, because for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: with 20 years or more of war going on over
there that involved Americans,
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan and Pakistan have been sort of
kind of like cut off for quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was people that went there in the
set like like Neville did and the and the
[SPEAKER_00]: drunkers and Sam Skunkman.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was people that went in the in the
70s on the hippie hashish trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, once once once the
wars got really crazy and extended,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that kind of the world has been
a little bit cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could say, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that that actually might have saved
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was we were talking to on one
of the podcasts that Matt and I did with
[SPEAKER_00]: this guy from Canada, from Federation
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he he was talking about how he spent
10 years in in Spain or maybe eight years,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a long time, a significant chunk of
time in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in his opinion, there's almost no
Moroccan weed left in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all Dutch weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all super silver haze and amnesia
haze and tangy and various things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's close enough to Spain that all
this genetics started going over there and
[SPEAKER_00]: people started saying, hey, I'll pay more
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this, this stuff turned this into hash
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me that they've had friends
going over there that have connections
[SPEAKER_00]: that are smugglers asking like the
mountain villagers and like the the tribal
[SPEAKER_00]: people, like, where's the old Moroccan
hash strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can't even find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't want to say war is good
because obviously, like, it's terrible for
[SPEAKER_00]: the people involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of preserving the genetics of
Pakistan and Afghanistan, that might have
[SPEAKER_00]: helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't been invaded by Dutch
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't been like even in I mean,
I've talked to people where they say they
[SPEAKER_00]: like even by the late 90s, most of the
Jamaican weed gave way from pure Jamaican
[SPEAKER_00]: into like White Widow and Blueberry and
Dutch hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they just wanted shorter,
faster, quicker, easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things to grow that were more marketable
for the market they were going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I I do think that there's a lot of
scrolling back to what you were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think there's positive stuff to these
people going around, going to these
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional farmers in Afghanistan and
Pakistan and the different regions
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting and preserving their seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think that's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll probably take some time and
some effort and some energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for instance, I have a buddy of
mine who I won't shout out on the thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I have a buddy of mine that has what
he calls this Kandahar.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a friend of his that was in the
military and was over in Afghanistan and
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up making friends with villagers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he brought back a bunch of seed and
gave it to his mom, who gave it to my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's breeding with this Kandahar
now, which is total land race from
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many generations of farmers it goes
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, everything he breeds it to it
herms like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so it just goes to show that like
taming some land races, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and and getting what you want out of them
is more work than a lot of breeders are
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think it's cool that there's a
whole hash culture over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a whole ecosystem that is
supporting a lot of those traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics in that part of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, wholeheartedly, I really love to see
that Irizan and the crew are trying to get
[SPEAKER_03]: some money back in the hands of,
you know, the guys who have preserved the
[SPEAKER_03]: land races for years, because something
that is very much lasted with me was a
[SPEAKER_03]: comment he made about how, you know,
you sometimes see modern breeders getting
[SPEAKER_03]: up in arms about people breeding with
their stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a notable example of that is
Fletcher from Archive has been on the
[SPEAKER_03]: record of being not thrilled with some
people breeding with do-si-do males and
[SPEAKER_03]: the like.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Irizan made the comment that,
you know, these land race farmers,
[SPEAKER_03]: they've never even had the opportunity to
get mad at people making money off their
[SPEAKER_03]: work, let alone maybe even making money
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I thought, you know, that's a valid
point.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we should try to support these
indigenous cultures where possible,
[SPEAKER_03]: because they truly, you know, we're all
standing on the shoulders of giants,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like we it's not like every
breeder out there just found their plants
[SPEAKER_03]: in the wild and can say, yeah,
I don't I don't know if thanks to anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I for one, I 100 percent
agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For two, not just to defend Fletch a bit
in that regard is that I think his point
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't necessarily so much that nobody
should be using do-si-do, but that people
[SPEAKER_00]: should be taking their time and their
energy to create stuff as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just because what's happening is
as as anything becomes popular,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets bred into everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people should be developing their
own do-si-dos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And developing their own type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that in breeding,
especially because breeding has changed a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Instagram, when I was doing most
of my breeding, there wasn't even an
[SPEAKER_00]: outlet to to move seats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really only been the last eight to
ten years with the advent of I.G.
[SPEAKER_00]: and forums and all these different things
going on that a lot of little breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: have had their day in the sun a lot more
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could do private breeding,
but selling it and was a lot was a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is, is that what
you've probably noticed is that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, one of the most common things is
people get famous or get associated with a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain cut or a certain family or a
certain group of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they make a seed company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're associated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they make a bunch of hybrids and
stuff and work based off what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: already known for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't want to, like, name drop or
anything like that, because I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to call out anybody over anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's plenty of people out there for
a long time that, like, if you want to use
[SPEAKER_00]: this cut, I want half the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you want to use this in breeding,
I want to be paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that went on behind the
scenes and wasn't very well known.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's lots of people that would
really milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something got well known and famous and
you wanted to use it, they would sell the
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings for five or 10 or 15 grand a
cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they would demand you, oh, you want to
breed with the seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I get 50 percent of them or you got
to give me 50 percent of the proceeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right in that all those people
that demand that it's not like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, eventually it would become like
multi-level marketing or something where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not kicking any points back to who
they got.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a good perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's in MLM.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like they're not like they're
like, you should pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not going to kick any of that up
to the people that like I didn't breed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even crack the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got it early enough and I held it
and I marketed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I mean, I could throw out
names out there, but it's like then
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever I named would just get upset at
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just I'll just say the general
gist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there's been lots of cuttings that have
been hoarded for value and the land race
[SPEAKER_00]: people and, you know, even people like
Neville or, you know, Sam will tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: that everything has his shit in it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neville would tell you before he passed
that most people in Holland ripped him
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and it's the same story today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's no there's no licensing
really going on in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like if the cut gets out,
anybody can do whatever they want with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just the honor system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can try public shaming or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, you know, you know,
people were and you figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at various times, people that claim to
be the first person that had something and
[SPEAKER_00]: they get very famous for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And time goes on and you realize that they
just got lucky enough to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the farmers getting something going on
now, hopefully those men, I'm not trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to diss those guys either, but hopefully
that's just not like a selling point for
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't kick money down to the
farmers either, because that's the honor
[SPEAKER_00]: system as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you're buying it directly
from the farmer when it comes to that land
[SPEAKER_00]: race stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to hope that they are paying good
money for the seed or they are kicking
[SPEAKER_00]: down some of the benefit of selling to
Westerners to those Afghani or those
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistani, you know, farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farming families.
[SPEAKER_03]: No doubt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I trust you as in these he's passing on as
he says he is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a quick caveat, you know, not trying
to have a go at Fletcher is just a talking
[SPEAKER_03]: point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still love you to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, that's why I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have mentioned four or five
people, you know, like, but I just didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was like, oh, man, at least two
of them will get mad at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it but it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people like one of the one
of the ways to make money and weed was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, was you get some cut early and
there's a huge demand for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some people are hoarding
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's that one guy that's like,
I'm willing to sell this cut for top
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I'm willing to make seeds with this
cutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be the first person that goes
on a forum and talks about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to get famous for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it can take a long time for
the nuance of what exactly happened to
[SPEAKER_00]: come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but that's I mean, you've probably
seen it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how many people have you interviewed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you interviewed them because they're
closely associated with a famous cut or a
[SPEAKER_00]: famous line, and you want to get the story
of it from them and then what they did
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, regularly, regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty it's one of the most common
ways to get famous and weed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And look, I mean, again, peace and love to
Fletcher.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know he he doesn't necessarily want to
come on the show, but again, kudos for the
[SPEAKER_03]: work.
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're talking about the land race
stuff, you made a really good point that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they're not necessarily growing
this stuff for flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're growing it for concentrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would love to springboard into,
you know, are you are you a flour guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a concentrates guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you lean more to one than the other?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you prefer one, what is it about
the other?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, because I'll happily tell anyone
I don't really smoke concentrates because,
[SPEAKER_03]: to be honest, my tolerance is kind of low
and I just get fucked up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you land?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I am a flour person 100
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I it's not like I don't like
hash, but if I was forced to choose one or
[SPEAKER_00]: the other for eternity, I would absolutely
choose flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of that is, you know,
like the relationships with the plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever concentrates are just that
concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, like when you're
breeding and stuff like that and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to sort out like I think when
you're when when you breed and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying out different types of cannabis,
keeping your tolerance at a flour level is
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have I have thoughts on on and,
you know, this will this will get
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody all all tightened up or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I just prefer when I get
really baked on flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that feeling more than I do off
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think flour is the purest way
to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it has you're not altering it in
any way other than heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, you know, when you when you know,
when you put it through BHO, when you put
[SPEAKER_00]: it through water, when you put it through
a freeze dryer, when you do all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things, do it a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That changes that changes various aspects
of of the buzz or the flavor profile or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I I also think that like
modern hash is incredibly different than
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're not similar at all for a
variety of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest reason is that most modern
hash is single source.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you take one clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you grow that clone in a
outdoor greenhouse or an indoor whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: situation you do, and then you harvest it
and you extract however you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: extract it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just that one genetic where most
traditional hash is like a field of
[SPEAKER_00]: sisters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about like think about the
difference between like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like one Australian in the town
you live versus like the entire town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the diversity contained within
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so with cannabis, if you're
getting a bunch of sisters, you're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a mix of, you know, THC
percentages, CBD, CBN, THCV, this,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, whatever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't actually grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing we have an advantage of
over traditional hashish, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: is purity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously there's a lot of
pressure on those farmers to get weight
[SPEAKER_00]: and sell kilos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most of the best hash that comes
from that region never leaves that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, if your experience with
hash is hash that's been adulterated or
[SPEAKER_00]: hash that's had other funk pounded into it
for more weight, most people, the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: they make at home is going to be a lot
higher quality than the best quality
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional than they've had access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go to say Holland, where
Holland obviously has a land connection to
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia, Holland would get was a much more of
a hash culture than a flower culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And those guys over there that were
growing a lot of those strains for the
[SPEAKER_00]: shops, the coffee shops, to a man,
almost all of them would sell the weed and
[SPEAKER_00]: they would buy the best hash they could
find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them believe that the best grade of
traditional hash from different regions in
[SPEAKER_00]: both taste and effect is superior to most
of the modern flower that you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but as a result of like the hash
revolution in America really happening in,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember when nails and some of
the accoutrements that made actually hash
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking easier started happening and
bangers started coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say it was probably like 10 or
12 years ago, 15 years ago, maybe like
[SPEAKER_00]: late 2010, 2012, 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first started smoking BHO and
stuff in the early 2000s, like even
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming it was a was a big pain in the
ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have all of the tools and all,
you know, and all the heated nails or the
[SPEAKER_00]: glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, the smoke pearls or the
bangers or whatever name you want to add
[SPEAKER_00]: to all the stuff that you have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this whole like wave of stuff that
you use to smoke hash now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all been developed over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, they have, I think most
hash is like, you know, does it taste
[SPEAKER_00]: good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it yield well?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you see people talking about washers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or dumpers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all about how much weight it gives
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of really high quality
strains that we were just talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: where like earlier in the show that they
don't wash well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore they would never get made
into hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like why would you, and I don't,
I don't even know what shoreline washes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's say that you like absolutely
adore shoreline, but it only washes three
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half percent where you get some
other grapes and cream by Skittles and it
[SPEAKER_00]: washes six percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extractor is going to make a lot more
money washing the stuff that yields more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hash market in America is very,
is very much based on color, look,
[SPEAKER_00]: smell and weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I didn't, I didn't mention effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I was going to ask,
you know, and like, I'm sure you've got a
[SPEAKER_03]: little more to follow up, so I'll let you
finish.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just as a, as a caveat, do you think
you can get like real sativa effects from
[SPEAKER_03]: a concentrate?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I, I've seen people,
I've seen people smoke like really pure,
[SPEAKER_00]: like heads, you know, like basically
pressed Keith of like say Neville's Hayes
[SPEAKER_00]: in Holland and had one or two hits,
like take them out and end their night.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can absolutely, you can
absolutely get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that, that would be like we
were talking earlier in the show,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be as the market matures and
demand for rarer or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain, certain things becomes more
valuable enough that it gets offered as a
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you, sativas are, are pretty
rare, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about how rare, you know,
imagine if you start looking around and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like, I want to get a really nice
few grams of pure sativa hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's even rarer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: God uphill battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's, that's, that's even
rarer to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, I think that I'm not,
you know, I don't have any issue with hash
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's plenty of people that like all
they smoke is hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's now there's a divide in the
Canada community over there's hash people
[SPEAKER_00]: and weed people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes people make fun of each
other or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not here to like say that like my
preferences are better than anybody else's
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as what I like, but I like smoking
joints and I like taking bong hits a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what seems to be, that's what seems
to me to give the best effect of what I
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I like, do I smoke hash sometimes?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I like certain kinds of hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I think a lot of midsy weed is getting
turned into weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hash and people are saying that
it's amazing because of how it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly.
Certainly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I should have, I should have asked a
second ago, but you mentioned how,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, these early Dutch growers,
they would sell their crop, go and get
[SPEAKER_03]: some hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that a part of that probably
has to do with the fact that they blend
[SPEAKER_03]: with tobacco so heavily over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it raises the more modern talking
point of the past few ego clashes the
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrate sections have actually been
won by blends, people where they're
[SPEAKER_03]: blending two or three strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember when I spoke with Bodhi
many years ago, he made this statement,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that we really haven't explored
the realm of blending all that much as a
[SPEAKER_03]: community.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thoughts on blending?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, say as a starting point,
the Dutch using the tobacco, is it sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: a necessary evil in a sense, but also more
modernly, do you think we can expect to
[SPEAKER_03]: see more adventuring into the realm of
blending?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're talking about blending of
different strains, blending of tobacco or
[SPEAKER_00]: both?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as a whole thing, you know,
and I mean, Bodhi even referenced the idea
[SPEAKER_03]: of in other psychedelics, they blend
different, you know, sort of sacred
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget the names of the ones he
mentioned, but, you know, some of them are
[SPEAKER_03]: like made from dried out succulents and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's real common in indigenous
cultures to blend tobacco and that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm wondering, what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously a big topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a big topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that some of it is
what's normal to you is what's normal to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are a product to some degree of the
culture that you grow up in.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as a result of that, like how you
smoke and how you consume cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: based upon that culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're growing up in Holland,
and most people are blending it with
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco, that's how you're going to learn
how to smoke when you start getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what's going to be normal to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you came up in America where we didn't
do that very much, the opposite would be
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would be like, oh, I smoke,
you know, I just smoke pure, pure flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that definitely when we first
went to Amsterdam in the 90s, they thought
[SPEAKER_00]: we were nuts for rolling joints of pure
weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I had to get a little drunk,
to be honest, to be in some of the coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: shops, because if you go in winter where
it's kind of cold and nasty out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in some little coffee shop and
there's like six or seven spliffs going on
[SPEAKER_00]: that like are mostly tobacco with like a
hash snake down the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so much smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're not a tobacco smoker,
it's literally like a haze of tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a little bit of weed mixed in and it
stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, I think that tobacco and
and, you know, it's like it's a different
[SPEAKER_00]: drug, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people get a zippiness from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get a different rush from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people might associate like that
buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like tobacco, so I'm not going to
be big into the blending thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are people around around me who
smoke spliffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a there's a movement in the youth
around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call them fifties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they'll take American spirit tobacco
and pack half a bong of American spirit
[SPEAKER_00]: and half a bong of flour and take bong
rips of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they call them fifties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a big wave, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I do think that that's that
stuff is going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: People do blend drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: People do blend, you know, things of that
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that much like,
you know, I was telling you just just a
[SPEAKER_00]: minute ago about how, you know,
if you're a breeder, you're better off
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping your tolerance at a flour level so
you can judge flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think it's a lot harder to judge
nuances if you're going to blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, hugely.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I mean, take take wine,
for instance, let's say that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to judge a nice Merlot,
then you just like you drink the Merlot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if you add a little bit of
Zinfandel in it or you add a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: Cabernet in it and you mix it all up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's making it much harder for you to
judge that thing by itself, because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's other elements in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it certainly does make it hard and
also, you know, there's the the comment
[SPEAKER_03]: about being able to clearly analyze and
break down the flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that undeniably is also
a muddled effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I will say, too, that like going
back to like when when like BHO and that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing first became popular,
it allowed a lot of strains that were not
[SPEAKER_00]: very potent to be acceptable to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to give you an example, there was a
point in time when it was very difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to even give away Cali O in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it was just that pure orange
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It most orange stuff is not very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very light high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very one note.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of fell out of favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Tangie came out right when the
BHO thing really started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, you could take this
like 10 or 12 or 14 percent Tangie that
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't very potent and didn't get you
ripped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could make some BHO of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, all of a sudden, it's 85 percent THC
and it works and it tastes really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took a lot of like light weed that
was kind of like midsy in effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it concentrated the effect to where it
was at an acceptable level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was it was a part of the way it came
around, didn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, you know, not to change the
topic quickly, but I mean, we're not even
[SPEAKER_03]: changing the topic, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you mentioned Cali O.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did want to talk about you because I
was thinking to myself, it sort of fit in
[SPEAKER_03]: with that category of, you know,
we were talking about the train wreck and
[SPEAKER_03]: the blue dream and the gray paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was sort of, you know, a little before
that era, but still in that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you feel about Cali O as a smoke
these days objectively?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, do you think what I've heard is,
you know, it's great flavor, but it's
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe not exactly very strong by modern
standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would agree with that 100
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not, you know, great flavor is
obviously subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that the flavor is pretty one
note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you like strong flavor of oranges on
your tongue, it's going to give you that
[SPEAKER_00]: in spades.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a lot of nuance to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very one note and very forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also because it's old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you know, it has it has a lot lower
THC percentage in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And its effect is pretty light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens to people with a lot of
the citrus, in my opinion, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: orange citrus or lemon or, you know,
that type of thing, is that it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: like a good palate cleanser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like eating like pickled ginger at a sushi
bar or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not something that you'd want for
your main course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not like, you know, you're like,
OK, I'm on vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on this island.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have this huge jar of Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're not going to be that stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like it's good as a change
of pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good as a palate cleanser.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to smoke for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is, is that almost
universally most people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can't be my daily driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's there's people that there's
people that there's weed out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: ends up being people's daily driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for me, I could smoke the dog or the
sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, there's I can go on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's there's certain ones where
it's like if I had to smoke that every
[SPEAKER_00]: day, I'd be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's ones that after a few puffs or
after a few days like not only are you
[SPEAKER_00]: like sort of bored by it because it has
like a short or a flat or a quick duration
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times certain things plateau.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get that experience where like
certain strains get you high every day?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they that that potency carries through
on a daily basis and you get the same like
[SPEAKER_00]: strong effect and then certain things you
might get high the first day or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after three or four days of smoking
it, the high really levels out and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of flat uninteresting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of think Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is like it's like fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it goes into fashion for a few years
and then everyone gets super over it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it falls off the face of the earth
and then it comes back in a different
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, the Tangy movement was basically
like an improved Cali.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just those same orange turps, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what's your thoughts on like the
forbidden fruits and the Tropicana
[SPEAKER_03]: cookies?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because to me, it seems very much in that
same realm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you say that those are improvements
or still just in the same vein?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's things that I actually
like about forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's got some cool genetics in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the sense that it can really throw a
lot of nice buds in low light conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew it once in a greenhouse where I
didn't even put it in until the 15th of
[SPEAKER_00]: September.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where that greenhouse was,
it only got about five or six hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: light at that late in the year because the
sun went behind the hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most things needed significantly more
light in order to form up well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the forbidden fruit formed huge colas
all over it like no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it got that five hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was all it needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely visually attractive and it
smells basically like one note Cali-O and
[SPEAKER_00]: it also is not very potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, I can have some of that as
some pickled ginger, but I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be eating a bunch of it daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty one note for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that analogy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the jar of coffee in between
smells like you're smelling colognes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, when we were at that event,
you get to a point where it's like how
[SPEAKER_00]: many jars of weed can you smell before you
need to take a break because you've kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of blown your sensors out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually sensory overload is a real thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were just saying like smell some
coffee, you know, like there's like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: why I said pallet cleanser, because
there's things that can kind of like wash
[SPEAKER_00]: away what was in there and reset your
pallet so that you can try something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be that would be my my
orange is the only the only citrus I
[SPEAKER_00]: really like is I like citrus that has a
creaminess or a sweetness on the back end,
[SPEAKER_00]: the citrus that's like extremely
astringent and citrus and one note.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get bored of that super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The citrus that has some softness or some,
you know, some sweetness behind it and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some other elements that come
through that to me is more interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's a reason why citrus
comes and goes in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because most people end up and getting
bored of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, people will bug me if I don't ask
any strains immediately jumped to mind
[SPEAKER_03]: that fit that criteria you mentioned of
sort of more appealing to you with the
[SPEAKER_03]: creamy sweetness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a gosh, now I'm going to
be there was a there was a cut we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost it in the 17 fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some seeds of it still.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a cut we called the tangerine
and it it was very citrusy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it had this this sweetness on the back
end that sort of like it's almost like in
[SPEAKER_00]: food, you know, when you have something
and you need something to like cut the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor and add some depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like when I smoke lemon tree,
it smells like someone just sprayed lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner in my mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's good for one or two hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, I'm like,
it's not so much for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can't think besides that
tangerine, I can't think of you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get a bunch of depth on citrus
from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Citrus is I could I could tell you
something funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That when we just had that event,
CSI brought a bunch of various seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: give away to the friends that were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the night, he dumped a
bunch of stuff on the ground and just let
[SPEAKER_00]: people pick what they wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stuff that was left was all Calio
hybrids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha ha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like out of the eight or 10 or 12 packs
that were that were left and nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: grabbed at the end, it was all something
by Calio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you have it, friends.
