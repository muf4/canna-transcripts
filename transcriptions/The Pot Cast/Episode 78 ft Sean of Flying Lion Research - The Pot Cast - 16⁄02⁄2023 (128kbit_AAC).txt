[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, alright, alright, welcome back my
friends for the next episode of The
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast, a cannabis podcast for budding
enthusiasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, you're joined by your boy,
Heavy Days, here from the Upside Down
[SPEAKER_00]: Library.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as always, we couldn't make these
episodes happen without the Patreon Gang.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love and appreciate you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: On this episode today, we're joined by my
buddy, a true turp connoisseur,
[SPEAKER_00]: and our first auto breeder on the show,
Sean of Flying Lion Research, here to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: all things auto breeding, Californian
cannabis history, future predictions,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the low down on turps, concentrations,
extraction, this was a fun one guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty gang, we're here for another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this episode, we are joined today
by a friend who's been making some waves
[SPEAKER_00]: in both the concentrate and auto scene for
a good minute now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very thrilled to be able to talk to him
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Sean of Flying Lion
Research for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lovely to have you on my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: First question, we've been asking people
lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you been smoking on today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, we've been dabbing on the lemon fat
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the flavor I dreamed up long ago from
the lemon tree days.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always dreamed of something being so
lemony, but that actually would hit you
[SPEAKER_02]: like an OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where the original project
came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bodie, plant more seeds, finally fixed up
the whole lemon tree debacle by getting
[SPEAKER_02]: the original lemon G and hitting it with
his, you know, hash plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen like he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that was the lemon hash plant
version two seeds I got to test out and it
[SPEAKER_02]: had that smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit it with the fatso cut that I got
from finest first ever tissue cultured cut
[SPEAKER_02]: that anyone I've ever talked to was able
to hit nice pollen too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, you know, not wrapping any
diseases into the DNA from making seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: for the first time available.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great tool for breeders really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all the progeny have been high
yielding and do what we want to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is yield for fresh frozen live rosin
and, you know, those 90 U heads and have
[SPEAKER_02]: that lemon turp flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really hard to capture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the main reason is, you know,
it's like you're doing work all day and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a, it's a work high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps you going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds delightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love how many different avenues you
gave me to go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's quickly start off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some Bodie love.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was cruising through your
Instagram, I saw you got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different experience with various Bodie
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the memorable ones to
you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it all started out with his,
um, Afghani crosses with his, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: G 13 88 hash plant pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically anything that we've always
run from him for the fresh frozen process,
[SPEAKER_02]: the flavor lingers in your mouth longer
than we've ran 20, 30 breeders at my farm
[SPEAKER_02]: over many, many years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so many of his things were just
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone asked for it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see the wookie orgasmic Ron was
a real winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, he's got lots of far out names.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, his Jalalabad star, uh, his strawberry
mill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, just so many winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's endless ones we could go
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just referenced, you know,
flavors that linger and I guess to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: tie it back to the lemon tree,
I would have to say lemon tree is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: up there with some of like, you know,
in terms of flavors that linger,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got to be in the top five for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think there are others that are
better than it, or is it likewise for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those really standout ones?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I mean, I always thought the lemon
tree was amazing until I grew the lemon G,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, myself and saw that it had no real
structure as a nice fuzz ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect for extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect for what I was working,
you know, looking for really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to hear Bodie worked with it to
increase its potency was exactly the kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of seeds I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think the sour diesel cut that,
um, the lemon tree is made out of really
[SPEAKER_02]: watered down the like lemon tree high that
is like supposedly kind of in the
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just good to actually bring that
terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people are like, Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unmistakable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, I'm not super up to date with the
origins of the lemon G, but from what I
[SPEAKER_00]: read, people say like, it might just be
like a Colombian or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that sort of matches some of the
descriptions you hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on the origin of the
lemon G?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, it's pretty common knowledge
that people say it came from Ohio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the Ohio lemon G cut, which was
passed around in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would need to do the whole,
you know, genome mapping and terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis and then look at, you know,
stuff like that and actually deduce where
[SPEAKER_02]: the actual land race came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to rewind for a moment,
you were talking about how hoplite and
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid is sort of everywhere and you were
able to get that tissue cultured fat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to hear your perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause obviously, you know, being in
California, you're surrounded by how bad
[SPEAKER_00]: is the situation in your mind in regards
to the hoplite and virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people are finding it in plants
that they think are healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a big, like, you know,
scary thought like, oh, there's nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong and experienced growers are getting
lab tests and finding it's not in the
[SPEAKER_02]: unhealthy plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just needed more minerals.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just kind of sitting there hidden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds real scary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, can't look at it with a
microscope.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to take tissue samples to
figure out if you have this virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, most everyone in the last five
years, I would say 95% of people I've
[SPEAKER_02]: talked to have had to eliminate their mom
rooms and reset everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it'll come to a point where
we have to, everyone tries to start fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it's just going to be one
of those things that's just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: persist forever now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think just like anything, you know,
the genetics are here to adapt and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: here for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like what I did this year, putting
seeds out and letting things succumb to
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases and, you know, that's the real
breeding work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can eventually breed away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been wondering that one myself,
but that's that's an angle I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to come back to the very start of
all of this way, you were saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, this this are the lemon hybrid
you've been enjoying today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good work strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea of work strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the exact sort of things I want to
smoke myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sort of things lend themselves to
that category in your mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides obviously just saying,
you know, sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any specific sorts of strains
you think really fit that category?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's really the combination of
limonene and alpha pionene being high in
[SPEAKER_02]: the extract that's going to tighten up all
your blood vessels faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vasoconstrictor versus vasodilator
associated with indica effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that constrictive action causes your
heart to pump harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel like you're ready to do pushups
or run a mile.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great thing when you're worked
all day the day before or worked all
[SPEAKER_02]: night, push yourself and your body's sore
in the morning, but yet the plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to get in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that the plants are ready to get in
the freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me more about your fresh frozen
activities because I'll be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have a lot to learn about fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you sell it to me?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've been fresh freezing here on
our farm for seven years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been doing it longer than most
anyone I've talked to.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done the dry ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done the scientific freezers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done generators in the back of the
truck.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I was going to sell it to you,
I would say, hey, if you're a farmer,
[SPEAKER_02]: you only get paid for the total weight of
cannabinoids that you produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those finer cannabinoids are
evaporating in your curing room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it smells good in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're okay with burning some of the
finest effort that you ever had every
[SPEAKER_02]: year, go ahead and cure your crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be here fresh freezing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a Zen monk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I noticed on your Instagram,
you had something that I had never heard
[SPEAKER_00]: of before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was what you called fresh frozen,
fresh frozen pressurized rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about the pressurized component.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems like quite innovative to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people do cold cure or what's
known as fresh pressed rosin, where they
[SPEAKER_02]: just take it out of the rosin press and
put it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a way to actually conceal some of
the qualities of your rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if you know what you're doing,
you can squeeze out your rosin and then
[SPEAKER_02]: freeze it and keep it fresh pressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of hides if it'll char the dab
nail later, or if it'll be harsh,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just all looks clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you whip your 90U, which is like
what West Coast Alchemy does, that's kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of the brand that sets the standards right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got this wet look on your 90U and
that's the terpenes coating the THCA in
[SPEAKER_02]: this nice kind of achievable quality where
you're like, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the indoor or really organic outdoor
from experienced growers, that'll have
[SPEAKER_02]: this really wet look because it has a high
amount of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what people want is a lot of
flavor with their rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to find a lot of flavor in
rosin because you know, only a few
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars work for that process
genetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of, a lot of details that I'm going
to have to go over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me, how do you think we can get more
of the general public onto these higher
[SPEAKER_00]: types of concentrates such as hash,
90U, things like that, because I think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a conundrum in that like you need
to show people, of course, but like
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not a lot of it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the price of rosin is dropping and
people are learning to fresh freeze and
[SPEAKER_02]: the collapse of the flower market with the
overproduction on the white market and the
[SPEAKER_02]: cartels has pushed small craft growers
into understanding fresh frozen whether
[SPEAKER_02]: they wanted to or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you've got a family and you've got a
big grow set up and you've got everything
[SPEAKER_02]: rolling, if you dried everything last
year, you're still sitting on it and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking at selling it at a loss if
you want any cash whatsoever before the
[SPEAKER_02]: next flood comes in 20 days, two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with all that excess stock from the
white market, do you think eventually a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of it will get turned into just like
simple concentrates and that'll have like
[SPEAKER_00]: a big flood on the market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why all your white market
investors are pushing for interstate
[SPEAKER_02]: commerce because we're at the breaking
point in the next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: 95% of cannabis companies didn't turn a
profit last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've either got billionaires who want
to keep losing money to prepare for
[SPEAKER_02]: federal legalization so that their brand
is ready or you got to make some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: lobbying effort between a state that's
just coming online and doesn't have a good
[SPEAKER_02]: environment to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you foresee that federal legalization
and those opening of borders happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: the near future?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many things at play and so many
things distracting from worldwide weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: as I call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, this amazing resource that can
unite the world, the first multi-trillion
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar industry that could unite third
world countries and first world countries
[SPEAKER_02]: and put everyone on a different playing
field as far as global terpene production
[SPEAKER_02]: and a global blockchain to, you know,
honestly take care of all the logistics,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like people want to buy weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the worldwide web.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why isn't it just, you can just go on
there and see like, Hey, I'm a farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do these are the soil tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my terroir.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the terpenes that grass valley
produces better than anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's other areas that are
going to produce unique terpenes,
[SPEAKER_02]: but here in grass valley, we can produce a
wide variety of nice ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that terroir will be understood on the
world market.
[SPEAKER_02]: If everyone can just get over themselves
and see that we can employ millions of
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been thinking about this because I've
been getting more into wineries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, and I was wondering,
do you think that will be the end state we
[SPEAKER_00]: get to where like, for example,
if you're in France in the Loire,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll probably grow in Chenin Blanc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's what will happen to
like what you're describing where like,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're in grass valley, you'll probably
grow in X strain because it's just the
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir matches or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think it'll be more variable
than say wine where it's quite homogenous?
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be more variable than wine,
but it will become more homogenous,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that will lead to like the ultimate
experience for the consumer because as the
[SPEAKER_02]: real small market farmers survive,
then they'll have to use the lab and the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil tests to differentiate themselves and
have genetics being made on site to make
[SPEAKER_02]: true land races for our place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like everyone else has done.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the whole colony colonization of weed
that's been happening, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like skunk man Sam and that whole crew
from Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I grew up in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm familiar with where blue dream was
created over in last chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some smart hippies, you know,
who were like, oh wait, like these tribes
[SPEAKER_02]: have already done thousands of years of
work to hybridize their unique cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have airplanes or breeding
sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like let's go to Thailand and collect
their seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to Oaxaca.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's cross all those together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where they made blue dream the
number one weed ever sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet those tribes still don't have running
water or solar panels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the real next step, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The ethics of genetics worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hugely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't deny that the funds are not
getting back to a lot of these indigenous
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be interested to know in this like
sort of future situation we describe,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think people would be growing like
more likely modern stuff that's refined to
[SPEAKER_00]: suit the area?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think certain places will just
literally go back to land race?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think with the global understanding of
worldwide weed and the market potential
[SPEAKER_02]: and the pharmaceutical understanding and
then that joining hopefully in a good way,
[SPEAKER_02]: it will lead to labs being built
everywhere where weed has been
[SPEAKER_02]: indigenously bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: For thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got Israel, a big corporation
willing to buy $40 million worth of weed
[SPEAKER_02]: from Canada, just to research,
not to smoke, just to put in their gas
[SPEAKER_02]: chromatography machines and genetic
analysis machines, then we've got this
[SPEAKER_02]: onus on us as humans to build those labs
and get that information to those local
[SPEAKER_02]: tribes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll find some unique terpene in
there that's going to heal all these
[SPEAKER_02]: diseases that are caused from our modern
society.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then those people will have something
valuable to hold onto.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've never really brought that topic up
on the show, but I'd be interested to
[SPEAKER_00]: know, do you think anyone is even remotely
close to Israel in terms of their research
[SPEAKER_00]: or interest in cannabis, like medically?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no one has the investment potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've put more in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they've only released that they
have had the bioreactor last week to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce cannabinoids without plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was reading that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that has massive like
scalability production and they could just
[SPEAKER_00]: be pumping that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, the whole thing about like
the ethics of CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people who maybe weren't involved
in cannabis grew and overproduced CBD and
[SPEAKER_02]: then went bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of magical cannabis spirit
protects herself from being too taken
[SPEAKER_02]: advantage of.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, but the real goal, right,
is to have CBD super cheap so that these
[SPEAKER_02]: $40 CBD bombs don't have 30 milligrams of
CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have 3000 milligrams because it just
costs $3 for that much now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we want is for everyone to
have these things available so everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: can benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the price point won't alienate
most people who aren't into cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: already as far as.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting more people to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, while we're on the topic
quickly, are there any minor cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're particularly passionate or a
fan of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having great results with CBG from
the Matterhorn strain from the hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pure CBG distillate has about 80%
naturally occurring CBG and 10% CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been giving it to all sorts of my
friends and people tell me from all walks
[SPEAKER_02]: of life, from all different diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: My one friend has a gastrointestinal
disease where he throws up unexpectedly
[SPEAKER_02]: and then he has lots of nausea and he
would spend a lot of time trying to find
[SPEAKER_02]: certain weeds that would help that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes he would.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sometimes the same strain
wouldn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And make it worse and he finally found
CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: He told me every time he adds it to
cannabis, his nausea is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same with a 50 year old basketball
aficionado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will call him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He loves basketball, but he's getting old
and the joints, the pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: He tells me all about how he just can only
play for 1020 minutes before his legs and
[SPEAKER_02]: knees hurt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after I gave him CBG came up to me and
he says, this is ethylcolic.
This is ecstatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Sean, like the CBG, like it went
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a two hour game.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done this in 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those kinds of experiences,
you know, they keep me dedicated to the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole cannabis realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can give that sort of relief to someone
and improve their quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your personal experience, do you feel
like the individual pharmacology is like
[SPEAKER_00]: person to person, or do you think it is
like, oh, if you have this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: issue, CBG will work well for everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say CBG has a higher efficacy for
most people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does have specific uses, just like
anything, and there's CBN and other minor
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids that do have other,
you know, pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for CBG, it's, I would say the
panacea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's known as the mother
cannabinoid, from what I've been told from
[SPEAKER_02]: chemists, all the other acetates are
created from CBG within the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it creates CBD and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's really cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to rewind for a moment, I forgot to
ask you, so I want to quickly do it before
[SPEAKER_00]: we move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that future scenario we were talking
about where, you know, there's like more
[SPEAKER_00]: federal and maybe even international
legalization of things, where do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh frozen would sit in that realm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it would be like one of the
top dogs or still something which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, upper echelon, you know,
like your high tier whiskey equivalent of
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol, something like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the concentrate market is
growing steadily.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at any of the sales on the
white market and any of the trends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, to take a nice dab requires a
laser thermometer and a quartz bucket and
[SPEAKER_02]: a torch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's going to be a slow
adaptation when there's a complicated tool
[SPEAKER_02]: set to anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why you see a big push to
rosin disposable pens or cartridges.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that technology is going to keep
getting better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So someone can just literally suck on a
tube and taste the best rosin ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: More people are always going to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we had a big reggae show here in
Grass Valley and all the guys who breathe
[SPEAKER_02]: and grow cannabis here were excited to be
backstage to give their rosin pen to
[SPEAKER_02]: Marlon Asher or, you know, Stefan Marley
or all the guys, you know, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: fun, my cannabis thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we have the best rosin pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you think about it,
right, the worldwide weed market happens
[SPEAKER_02]: like people want a bunch of pens for like
birthday or a party, big wedding
[SPEAKER_02]: celebration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like we fell in love over this
cannabis flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're having it made up in pens so
everyone at our wedding gets one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like natural, like it's the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be easier for an
inexperienced consumer to articulate the
[SPEAKER_02]: differences of the cannabis high with
rosin or live resin diamonds, as opposed
[SPEAKER_02]: to normal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fresh frozen allows for those terpenes to
really tip the scales of is this super
[SPEAKER_02]: exciting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this super grounding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I super tired?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this cannabis super narcotic?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you gave just a beginner, you know,
sour diesel and some lemon G, it'd be hard
[SPEAKER_02]: for them to just totally articulate,
oh, okay, this one's super racy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with that amount of terpenes hitting
your brain at the right time, without any
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon in there, it's nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: No cough if it's done right, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the smooth thing for a lot of new
consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want it to be harsh or to burn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so all those things are remedied by
doing the fresh frozen harvest and going
[SPEAKER_02]: through that work to extract it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, what a beautiful answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wholeheartedly agree with all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've, I've got to like tell you this
quick story now, because I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ever told you this, but at one of the
Emerald Cups one year, I think it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017, 2018, you came up to me and you gave
me a dab of this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what it was, but to this
day, it's still the terpiest thing I've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, it really, it really helped
me understand how like some guys can get
[SPEAKER_00]: full into like that whole I'm the Terp
Slurper dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was like the light bulb moment for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my question is, do you remember
what that dab was by any chance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, what was your light bulb moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you had like a little elephant
rig that was what I took a hit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a little elephant,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was definitely the Grape Crinkle
diamonds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because I, you know, wanted to be known
as doing something unique in my lane,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was breeding and I still am breeding
Otto Flowers, also known as Ruderalis for
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wanted to explore all the new
terpenes that were within that whole realm
[SPEAKER_02]: since at the time there was just Blue
Dream, OG, Sour D, Cherry Pie,
[SPEAKER_02]: diamonds that everyone had already tried,
you know, along with your million
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties of gelato diamonds that all
tasted the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Ruderalis seemed to make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was totally organic, unlike light
depth, which requires you to build massive
[SPEAKER_02]: infrastructure and have greenhouses,
PVC, tarps, nine yards.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really put seed into the earth if
you're going to farm resin, which is what
[SPEAKER_02]: I do and breed resin for the consumer,
right, to have unique experiences.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that Grape Crinkle really put me
on the map because it was, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I could just bring the frozen weed
pre-Prop 64 to companies and then they
[SPEAKER_02]: would make live resin because they knew I
didn't use pesticides and I had a permit
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my diamonds really got out there and I
heard a lot of cool feedback because no
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers had ever tried a Ruderalis
diamond.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they didn't even know what that
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a great, you know, kind of
mystery to explore now that I'm seven
[SPEAKER_02]: years deep in that mystery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a whole world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot more to go.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me, tell me a bit more about your
first experiences growing autos and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: was you came to be like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I'm going to launch into.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first time I saw autos was 2007 and
it was right around the time where we had
[SPEAKER_02]: gotten good at, you know, selling weed in
San Francisco and we had our art gallery
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything was going good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, right around a certain time
in summer, all the depths would sell out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'd be no more depths and it'd be
like, Oh, you have to wait till October
[SPEAKER_02]: for outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, no one's got indoor in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this girl showed up and she had the
most lemony big buds I had seen in a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they just looked so fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, when were these cured?
[SPEAKER_02]: She's like, Oh, two weeks ago,
I grew them in my backyard in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just was so amazed of the quality
and the taste and the high and the timing
[SPEAKER_02]: at the market, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When everyone was willing to pay whatever
and she had it perfectly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked her about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bought a bunch of seeds from
different auto flower companies and I had
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed results and finally found a good
breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a Fisto from Spain, great,
great guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with them and sent them pictures
and say, you know, made seeds and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, made extracts, sent them lab
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, wow, this guy really
takes our seed seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they sent me their experimental seeds
so I could get ahead of the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: ruderalis wave so I could have my own
flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I've just been surfing ever
since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's so neat to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you know, Mephisto is regarded
in the industry as a really top notch auto
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: What of the sort of unreleased lines that
they sent you caught your attention?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you decide to run with?
[SPEAKER_02]: So about six or nine months before they
released their pink Panama and their glue
[SPEAKER_02]: strains, their orange glue and their
orange sunshine strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, I had these testers and I was
able to breed with them for, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the live resin process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because the THC was so fresh and there
was no diseases or spray or anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the auto flowers are so fast,
the bugs just couldn't figure it out and
[SPEAKER_02]: climb onto them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hearing from the lab, they would say,
oh, the diamonds crashed out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're thinking like four days,
it usually takes three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would breed those varieties that
worked for the process of live resin into
[SPEAKER_02]: the experimental ones they gave me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people love the pink Panama.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so awesome to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got me thinking, is there like any
differences in like selection in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: how you do autos versus females?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you sort of eluded that like you
use the lab to help guide you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just also use the general
principles of breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, this is sort of my
criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see how does it differ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's you can't hold on to a trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like riding a wave.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're reversing your winner,
which you're guessing is a winner from the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed stock that you've already ran,
you're making educated the guess and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing that guess with a few things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then now you have a few different
seed stocks from a few reversed females,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then you test those out and then you
can compare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that has the trait I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you move one into production and
you hold on to the seeds that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: produce more of what you want,
just like a hundred.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you have that hundred, then you can
make more of those ones and find more of
[SPEAKER_02]: something you like, or cross it into
something new.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't actually hold mom stock at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to hold seeds of the
winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, you know, out of every
plant, each one has to be uniquely marked
[SPEAKER_02]: and you have to like get the biggest seeds
out of there and test those out uniquely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You answered the next question I was going
to ask, which was like, technically,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you breed autos?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess you just sort of did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know of any other ways?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I can't remember who, but someone
said there's like a chemical you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll like stop the plant from
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know anything about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as far as breeding autos,
like obviously you can have a regular auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers, but Mephisto doesn't really let
out regular autos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause then it's easy for you to produce a
lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I won one pack of white stomper from
Mephisto in an auction.
[SPEAKER_02]: One time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're feminizing seeds,
you're using silver thiosulfate and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: a mixture of chemicals that are going to
block the femininity from being expressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your feminine plant is going to grow
balls and those balls don't have a man
[SPEAKER_02]: sheen in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have the chromosome to make a
male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the seeds are going to be
feminized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a great process if you want to
lock in a trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, if you read genetic, you know,
warnings after four to seven generations
[SPEAKER_02]: of feminizing, you can end up in a genetic
dead end and have lots of hermaphrodism
[SPEAKER_02]: and problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you kind of want to zip up your gene
with feminization and then unzip it with a
[SPEAKER_02]: regular auto flower seed, which is the
work I've recently been doing after doing
[SPEAKER_02]: five generations of feminization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I have hit it with male auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then is the plan then to work like
sort of fresh feminized stock forward
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not in that bottleneck or do you
want to work the male female stuff just
[SPEAKER_00]: out from there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you unzip it, then you can zip it
back up in a direction that you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the direction that I'm going is to
make full melt trichomes that fall off to
[SPEAKER_02]: make live rosin a hundred percent in the
genome of the auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once right now, it's like 60 percent,
you know, have the nice tacky wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, 40 percent are going to be greasy
still and you're going to work better for
[SPEAKER_02]: live resin and be BHO or butane
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess while we're here, what are
your thoughts on some of the other forms
[SPEAKER_00]: of concentrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I'm sure you don't hate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have like a hierarchy of like
concentration traits in terms of like
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe fresh rosins at the top and then
other stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you've got your BHO diamonds and
you've got your live rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those two things are premium extracts
when done with the genetics that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can express flavors that you can never
capture in rosin in live resin diamonds
[SPEAKER_02]: because butane can capture more terpenes
in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: In another way, really good rosin has a
unique flavor and a unique high compared
[SPEAKER_02]: to the diamonds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as they're done right and from
the right genetics, it's an amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your tiny trichomes on all your
gelato flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone's going to grow that to an A
plus, like in apples and bananas,
[SPEAKER_02]: that makes amazing diamonds and the flavor
comes through.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're not going to get that deep
flavor if you try and wash that strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: But banana OG and, you know, strains like
that, they're going to make the amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: banana flavor for rosin that new consumers
love because that banana terpene is so
[SPEAKER_02]: smooth and candy like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your thoughts on straight water
hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some of the heads, you know,
they still regard really nice,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, dry sieve or water hash to be in
that premier tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been making full melt for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, since I've had my farm and moved
into genetics, I've moved away from making
[SPEAKER_02]: my own full melt and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before FreshFrozen was invented,
we were all about the full melt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the best hash you could get from,
let's see, 2005 to 2014, maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, focusing on strains that
worked with that process and made really
[SPEAKER_02]: big heads, made for a great experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had glassblowers design me,
you know, glass rods and things like this
[SPEAKER_02]: before dabbing invented.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had our own ways to like smoke it in
a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But since the rosin was invented and since
squishing it, I mean, I've squished my own
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And rosin, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like how you have to decarb some THC
to make it work for edibles and this whole
[SPEAKER_02]: decarbing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it goes back to your original
question, maybe that I didn't get to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You asked about pressurized rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like there's the cold cure and you can
whip it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you have a lot of cold cure and
you're like, okay, we will have tried
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: People realize that you could put that
cold cure into a vacuum purge oven,
[SPEAKER_02]: which actually, you know, sucks out all
the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's what we used years ago when we
would make butane shatter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it creates like about 90 degrees
temperature and 180 moles of pressure,
[SPEAKER_02]: similar to, you know, out there in outer
space or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it causes a nucleation and the terpene
separation of the rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this causes a texture change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can load your rosin into
pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, you've caused the
terpenes to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're easy to get into your
brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a clearer, quicker high.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you turn your rosin into rosin jam,
there's like, that's the tech rosin jam
[SPEAKER_02]: tech, or there's rosin diamond tech,
but only certain strains are going to work
[SPEAKER_02]: for this process.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's certain finer terpenes that are
completely antagonized if you try to make
[SPEAKER_02]: jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I forget, I want to quickly ask,
you just described what sounds like making
[SPEAKER_00]: a really nice rosin that you said,
you know, you might be able to get into a
[SPEAKER_00]: pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested to know, like, obviously
the vape pens are here to stay,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always going to be a big sort of
casual market that really likes them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think they will get better over
time or do you think they will be limited
[SPEAKER_00]: at a certain point, just by sort of the
design or the inputs?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said this at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: When vape carts were, you know,
first invented that we needed a PhD
[SPEAKER_02]: thermodynamic guy in there to really
figure this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need some physics guys and they all
need to talk together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's a bunch of
corporations that are jumping on this and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're busting out pens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So far all their failure rates are too
high to, you know, put your valuable
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of hurts when, you know,
you got the failed hardware and your
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers like, well, shit, you're like,
all right, well, here's another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's so wasteful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, God damn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's some companies using hemp
plastic and the pressure's on right now
[SPEAKER_02]: for that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like they have enough money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've made enough money from selling us
the bullshit B grade carts and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have a new line in the next 10
years that are going to be the smoothest
[SPEAKER_02]: ever experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to make it so that more people
will dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, do you think in the long-term,
the overall market will move away from
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers and more towards concentrates
because as you've alluded to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like easy use, higher terpene sort of
expressions, if like the inputs are really
[SPEAKER_00]: good, where do you think we're heading in
general?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It matches up with global scalability,
global shipping, medical analysis,
[SPEAKER_02]: medical efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the raw materials is weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the real raw materials,
really good weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure your weed is the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have the best raw materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people will kill me if I don't
ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we better jump into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be able to give us a bit of an
overview of what your process is
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for making fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: For like harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of like from harvest to say when
you've got it in a jar, if you could just
[SPEAKER_00]: touch on some of the major dot points
here, you don't have to drill into super
[SPEAKER_00]: intense details, but just generally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it all starts with being in line with
the biodynamic calendar.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't work on off days.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work on flower days.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been scientifically illustrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get higher yields from flower crops
and the seed oils that come from flower
[SPEAKER_02]: seed crops if you harvest them on flower
days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're in line with the biodynamic
calendar and we got a crew of lovely
[SPEAKER_02]: ladies that comes and harvest the plants
every night.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants have to be cold to the touch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously if it's overcast and then it's
okay too, but you can't harvest lettuce in
[SPEAKER_02]: the sun and then go sell it at the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll melt into a pile of mush,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Same principles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to disconnect the plant from the
earth when it's cold to the touch,
[SPEAKER_02]: ideally at six in the morning,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can motivate your crew,
you cut down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when they have maximum terpene
production from defending themselves from
[SPEAKER_02]: insects all night.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right at 6 AM, you're going to have
that high terpene production.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as the light hits, then your
terpenes drop considerably on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day that cycle happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get in there when you can and then
get those plants into the freezer as fast
[SPEAKER_02]: as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't put it all into one freezer all
at a time because then it'll compost in
[SPEAKER_02]: the middle of itself because it's hot
plant matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to bag up 500 to a thousand
grams at a time, put it on dry ice or in a
[SPEAKER_02]: lonely freezer, not next to other fresh
frozen weed trying to get frozen and make
[SPEAKER_02]: a frozen block and then put it in the
other freezer with the frozen weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, essentially like if there was
someone listening who like grew up in a
[SPEAKER_02]: butchery, they would understand all the
principles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I tell people who are
trying to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, look at how you would treat a
Wagyu cow in Japan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at how Native Americans break down a
deer.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a way to eviscerate an animal and
get those vital nutrients and stakes and
[SPEAKER_02]: organs packed, sealed and in a freezer to
celebrate life later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the same kind of principles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got a big leaf beforehand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's not too much backlog while
you're trying to get it into the bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want a big leaf too much to
shock the plant while it's alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a balance there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously you want to look with your
microscope and see your trichomes and see
[SPEAKER_02]: where everything's at and make your
decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're freezing, you're right,
greasy or tacky to determine if it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to work for what process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many guys jump into it and think they
can make, Oh, I'm going to make full melt
[SPEAKER_02]: live rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I froze all my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what did you grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Oh, I grew like low pops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gelato cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to see like 1% of your
crop yield into hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's really going to pay
for anything, but you're welcome to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so much to go into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to quickly ask, what is the
tricolor you like to harvest at?
[SPEAKER_02]: 50% milky, 30% milky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on the weather, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's 20% milky and it's like seven days
of storm, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that because like it continues to
mature for a little bit after that or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sometimes it's easy to
underestimate how much labor is involved
[SPEAKER_02]: in the fresh frozen harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like it's easy to underestimate if
you never killed an animal and then broken
[SPEAKER_02]: down all its parts into meat, how much
work that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take me back to the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got the plants in the freezers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do we go from there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they're either labeled by strain
labeled by their date labeled with a paint
[SPEAKER_02]: pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you use a marker in the freezer,
it all rubs off and you don't know what's
[SPEAKER_02]: what.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a bunch of frozen bricks of weed
that you can guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you got to get it to your extractor,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you either got to buy dry ice and put
it in totes or a freezer that is frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you're driving 30 minutes,
you can just unplug a freezer,
[SPEAKER_02]: put it into your truck, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's yeah, it's dangerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're taking like a three hour
mission, you got to have an open bed,
[SPEAKER_02]: flat bed truck with a generator powering
your freezers while you drive or you're
[SPEAKER_02]: buying a bunch of dry ice to load into
something to keep it cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, you know, you don't want your
meat to rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you get to your spot,
you're either going to bring stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to crush up and load in for
gas and for butane extraction,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you're going to throw it into your cold
room for your water extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, you want to work with an
extractor who has, you know, good ice
[SPEAKER_02]: cubes, good understanding of trichomes,
the cement mixer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's some people who do it by
hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of options as far as that
goes, but there's a lot of details.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you really want to be on it with
your extractor about like what your
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage is and how much you're getting
back.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many guys and there's only so
much you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I do is I grow a bunch of the same
thing and I give fresh frozen to say,
[SPEAKER_02]: resin ranch, full flavor and gold country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now they all know they have the same
frozen weed for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've created like a little mini
competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's going to yield the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's going to make the terpiest out of
all the same material?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see a huge variance, a huge
variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we jump into those co-labs,
because I noticed them and they look cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that like it seems like
you're one of the guys who I might be
[SPEAKER_00]: going out on a limb here, but it seems
like you recognize the limits of where you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to spread yourself too thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I'm not the guy who does
the extraction because you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really knowledgeable in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've got a lot of overlapping
knowledge, but is that largely how you see
[SPEAKER_00]: it where you're like, I can't do
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just be spreading myself too
thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to have like a sort of demarcation
of where my skill set is going to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to focus on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how you view it or have I just
confused it a bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I got into hash before anyone was
in hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in 2001, right, I got kilos of hash
that I, you know, help people out in
[SPEAKER_02]: college with in a medical setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Under prop two 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this hash was from soldiers who were
coming back from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this shit was pressed with a gold
seal, probably five, 10% opium in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these kind of full melts from
the international market were the first
[SPEAKER_02]: hashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone was like, wow, this is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most people didn't know what it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't know what it was about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always been interested in resin
production and why cultures got into it
[SPEAKER_02]: and how long the history of all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, when rosin was came around
and I'd already been making full melts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew the amount of labor it takes to
produce weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked on many farms and seen many
failures go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm in an educated position to make a
decision for myself about how I can change
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis industry space for the
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's by focusing in my lane on what I
uniquely know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I spread myself too thin,
like you said, oh, I'm going to wash it
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm going to extract it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, then you can't focus on the
genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd love to get to a point where I can
just have more cuts and more genetics so
[SPEAKER_02]: that I can just work with that and move
actually out of resin production itself
[SPEAKER_02]: and into just looking at resin production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And choosing the best genetics for that
process 100% of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very admirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: A man honing his craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to jump back to what you
referenced before, you know, you work with
[SPEAKER_00]: these various extractors and I noticed you
had this, what I thought was a really
[SPEAKER_00]: impressive little collab box you put
together with Gold Country Resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I really found interesting about
it was each of those six different
[SPEAKER_00]: offerings in that box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was like a different sort of terpene
dominate concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're really giving people all the
base colors to see what like the primary
[SPEAKER_00]: colors are basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to know what inspired you to do
this because it's such a neat idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, what was the thinking behind
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had the first test at SC Labs with a
rare terpene long ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: My friend Alec, he was one of the guys who
started that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to college with him at UC Santa
Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I first got into the ruderalis
plants and I had my own ruderalis nugs,
[SPEAKER_02]: I obviously brought it to SC Labs and I
was like, wow, you can do a terpene test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they called me back and they were
like, we've never seen this terpene before
[SPEAKER_02]: at a 3% level.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of flower is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting that feedback really did
inspire me and send me on the journey I am
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just going on like, cause I was like,
oh shit, this is a discovery and there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of rare kind of things out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like you said at the beginning,
how do we get more people excited about
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're at this point where because
the market and the government don't get
[SPEAKER_02]: along, it's harder for the consumer to
understand what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because the white market people are
losing money and the dispensaries are
[SPEAKER_02]: losing money and the government is making
it harder for those people.
[SPEAKER_02]: The effect is the consumers are confused
about one of the largest growing markets
[SPEAKER_02]: with so many products being invented
daily.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's very confusing for someone to
go into a store and see something called
[SPEAKER_02]: live resin and it's super harsh and it's
made from trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no regulations in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they use like CRC clays and filters
and then blast a bunch of trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then call that live resin at the
store.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then people have like these bad
experiences, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the test, you know, the test on
the side, it's like 90% THC with a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of other numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's super like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Confusing like, okay, well, I guess I'll
have the 90% instead of the 88%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But consumers are just getting,
you know, literally confused by that
[SPEAKER_02]: information because the government doesn't
require a terpene test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did is I terpene tested a bunch
of black market Rosins that I felt like
[SPEAKER_02]: people wouldn't really understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if they just put their nose over it,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I got the terpene test and showed
how all these things were different and
[SPEAKER_02]: how Rosin can, you know, bring you up,
help with workouts, help with sex,
[SPEAKER_02]: help with cooking, help with appetite,
help with all these random things,
[SPEAKER_02]: according to the terpenes, then people
could start seeing, Oh, Oh, the mercy and
[SPEAKER_02]: that works for me when I get home from
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's in papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like papaya because it has alpha
pining.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then people can start making these
decisions for themselves, as opposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly be can being confused about THC
percentages, which have little to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: the high or how the high affects you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just had a curious question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just out of curiosity, do you think that
these really single dominant terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles are sort of more interesting from
your point of view?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you think like a really mixed
variable one can be equally as
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that's kind of the world that I
want people to explore, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of the world that we want
to create to create the understanding of
[SPEAKER_02]: the terroir.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to create this language where
people understand that like the first
[SPEAKER_02]: three terpenes are going to very much
dictate the effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got those first four on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, most people were very surprised.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even gold country himself.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, wow, I can't believe so many
rosins are just high in limonene.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that GMO and papaya were so
different, but they're both have limonene
[SPEAKER_02]: as the dominant terpene, but the secondary
terpene is different in both of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of teaches people about like
their nose and what our sense of smell is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that's really important in
this world is our sense of smell is our
[SPEAKER_02]: sense of instinct.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's connected to our memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things trying to
disconnect us from our sense of smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And having this terpene kit allowed people
to do their own self research,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: A bio essay, like the medical term for how
you felt when you took your dab,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like, and then people can
actually have a language like Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they can go into the club and say,
Hey, so I got this research kit and this
[SPEAKER_02]: one with mercine and beta cariophylline in
equal amounts really actually worked the
[SPEAKER_02]: best out of all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the kind of nuanced question
that will put pressure on the bud tenders
[SPEAKER_02]: to put pressure on the growers to get the
terpene test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some growers and rosin manufacturers
are already doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: One company out of Oregon would put a
little terpene chart in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was really impressed with that with
each gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but not much explanation about that
effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where we need to flesh
everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it becomes a more mainstay of
the labeling and you can get a better idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of what's going on under the hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you mentioned it twice and it's sort
of been on my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do you think papaya is getting such a
big resurgence at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, the drop in the market
value of dried flour is going to change
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to push people to look for
cuts that work for hash and papaya has an
[SPEAKER_02]: amazing flavor and it always hits above
four or 5% if you get the good papaya cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're going to get, you know,
your economic value out of that and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get your rosin yields so that
your washer gets his percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And globally speaking, most people haven't
had a papaya, you know, like it's still
[SPEAKER_02]: exotic as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you tell people, oh, hey,
like I remember saying, oh, I've got
[SPEAKER_02]: papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, after saying it to however
many people who come up to my booth,
[SPEAKER_02]: one person's like, what's a papaya?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause papaya is so exotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people to just had like the fruits
that they know of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just, it's just going to keep
spreading papaya and oh, and personally,
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel that the high is like, you know,
like similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a little bit more relaxation on
the muscles, but it's got a lot of mind
[SPEAKER_02]: engagement and will keep you going in the
day and help with sore muscles.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been talking a bit about the
papaya strain and I wanted to ask you
[SPEAKER_00]: about your durian strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: My buddy, Osgrohe and Exotic shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he wants a durian strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his heart set on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me about yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it like?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the durian project is hitting onion
fritter into the papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, we have like the shallot sashimi
from T Beasel and that's a good rosin
[SPEAKER_02]: strain that gives it a savory,
uh, terp profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you hit that with papaya,
we think that within that seed stock that
[SPEAKER_02]: will find like the true durian expression.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you reckon you're just a little more
hunting and you'll be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the goal right now is we're trying
to find the durian and passion fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The passion fruit project is forbidden
fruit, legendary OG hit with Bodhi's lemon
[SPEAKER_02]: hash plant version two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the durian project is the shallot,
sashimi and papaya cross together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, you just made my day that
you're doing a passion fruit project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half the time when I talk to people about
passion fruit, they don't, they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: what you said earlier, it's an exotic
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people aren't like, they're not
familiar with it and whatnot, but I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: a passion fruit line I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to trade seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, my one is a triangle pupil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like TK by Pakistani star pupil by
raspberry mama, which is like a pink
[SPEAKER_00]: champagne sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you remember that from back in the day,
Oh, I love pink champagne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to remember that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to send you some seeds because
yeah, I too have long been looking for a
[SPEAKER_00]: passion fruit strain and sometimes you get
close, but you're not quite there and it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be really neat to find one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just talking today with the village
guys who found like the Amorello.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there some phenos within the Amorello
or expressing passion fruit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them more pineapple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I haven't been able to find the
Amorello cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing my breeding project here
starting hopefully before the ego clash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got lots of winners lined up from
this year that I've made into clones and
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, we're going to do the honey bananas
since it's my favorite rosin and it won
[SPEAKER_02]: the ego clash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're reversing the honey bananas into as
many winning cuts as I can find.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally, if I can do the honey bananas
into Amorello, I think we'll find
[SPEAKER_02]: something there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the Satsuma Sherbert and the Purple
Rain, which is a Masonics Trop Wilson
[SPEAKER_02]: phenohunted and the Tropical Drank,
which is a pineapple Hindu skittle crossed
[SPEAKER_02]: into orange skittle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many avenues to dive down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we jump off the topic, we've been
talking about some Australian stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was interested to know what your
experience with the Australian genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I had one worker did come back from
Australia.
[SPEAKER_02]: She met an aboriginal guy and he gave her
seeds and I crossed that onto like Gelato
[SPEAKER_02]: and Anxion OG and a few others to make
Ossilado and yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask you specifically about
that because you gave me a pack of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ossilado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I brought it back to Australia and I think
my buddy grew it out on his farm in the
[SPEAKER_00]: far northern rivers, like near that real
hotspot of Australia, like that Nimbun
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I wanted to ask you,
do you remember much about that Australian
[SPEAKER_00]: line you used?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it had super cool structure,
super vigorous growth and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: drought resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did it look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I imagine it might be similar to
what I was talking about because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal plants outdoors, but it's just
the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really my thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had the structure of, yeah,
kind of old school white widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not anything like we have here,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't round at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like no round big buds ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Small little bracts.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very interesting to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get my hands on a line in
Australia called Zoid Fuel, which was made
[SPEAKER_00]: by these guys back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were called the Wizards of Oz.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess the interesting thing about
this line is it's the only really notable
[SPEAKER_00]: line where there's any info on it,
where it was bred from 100% non-European
[SPEAKER_00]: or American stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just made from three land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made from a Chinese Yuan,
a PNG gold and like an Australian sort of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, heirloom sativa sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it looks like a real modern strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's one of those sort of like,
I think Neville spoke about it once where
[SPEAKER_00]: he was like, I could never do something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like spin together a couple of land races
to make something that looks like modern
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's this line Zoid Fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's meant to be super racy from the PNG
gold high, like just real anxiety
[SPEAKER_00]: inducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, give me more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm trying to get my hands on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I ever do, I'll be sure to get you
some, cause I reckon it'd be right up your
[SPEAKER_00]: alley as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of land races, we've got a 16
footer that just made it through three
[SPEAKER_02]: rain storms, completely unharmed,
zero mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had my mother, she was going to Tanzania
and I was like, Oh, I want the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you meet anyone, give me the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she met these tribal people who gave
her real wild Tanzanian seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found a mail that, you know,
dropped pollen on like November 10th,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I was like, Oh, it opened up
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I had my farm manager at the time
had gone over to yoga school in Southern
[SPEAKER_02]: India to Karnataka.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she got wild weed that was amazingly
purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: She picked the purplest, you know,
and brought it back to seeds, just real
[SPEAKER_02]: land race from India.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I made a Tanzanian India cross and
that's, that's what's growing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be done by Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You getting any interesting sniffs of it
yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I forgot like, well,
I grew those and they were just getting so
[SPEAKER_02]: big and had zero smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, wow, they are amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They smell nothing like anything in my
garden, nothing even close.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've done this before, you know,
everyone knows you're not going to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of biomass or bud off of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be low yielding,
but from experience, you put 20,
[SPEAKER_02]: 30% of that biomass in with something
regular and then make your live present
[SPEAKER_02]: diamonds.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent of the consumers notice
they're like this land race turf.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never felt anything like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remind me of a, like a, a talking
point Bodhi mentioned to me years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like, just like not, not
restricted to one specific area,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in general, the whole art of blending
is not really been explored that much in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, whether we're talking about like
blending strains or blending like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: With other plants, what's your thoughts on
blending?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's got a spot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been dealing with blending from
the beginning since I've been fresh
[SPEAKER_02]: freezing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a minimum batch size for
your diamonds, 6,000 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's your minimum batch size
for water hash, sometimes 20,000 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to think about what's going
to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I have blended stuff and then I
tried it and I was like, Ooh, dang it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally blended that.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the terpenes is now completely
overpowered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you remember those mistakes because
you kind of know intuitively, like how
[SPEAKER_02]: much people would have been impressed if
that had been pulled off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're like, people will never
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's going to be winners and there's
going to be losers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you basically want to do like your
cakey strains with like a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: lemon, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to mix super fruity,
unique strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you wouldn't want to mix apples and a
papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you wouldn't, if I had apple fritter
and papaya, I would mix them both rather
[SPEAKER_02]: with like a kush mints or something
instead of together, because then they
[SPEAKER_02]: would antagonize each other's flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dosey dough is a good background for any
of the fruity ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just even listening to this makes me
realize like I don't have anything
[SPEAKER_00]: meaningful to say because I've got no idea
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a novel field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, last year at the ego clash,
a blend won.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that's kind of like standard where
people are like putting it on the label,
[SPEAKER_02]: like, okay, this is my new flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's 30% this 30% that and 30%
this, you know, so it's telling you that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're putting three flavors together
that they think will work good together.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have been blending rainbow belts
and Dosey dough a lot and the moon bow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blending that into pure rainbow belts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like more moon bow ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the idea of blending in
general, a, you know, it's been proven as
[SPEAKER_00]: a, an effective concept in other
industries, like, you know, wine and
[SPEAKER_00]: spirits, but, but also it lends itself,
as you were saying earlier to the scale up
[SPEAKER_00]: of massive ag and being able to acquire a
bunch of concentrates and blend them
[SPEAKER_00]: together to make your Jack Daniel's number
seven, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that is the ultimate goal,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The one Rosin corporation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: All small farmers were in the one Rosin
corporation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all have our name is one legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So none of us can be taxed and we can
produce the best Rosin because we all have
[SPEAKER_02]: so much of everything that we can do huge
terpene analysis and then always make the
[SPEAKER_02]: most potent of each of the thing the same
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is, is there's a huge
variance in terpene expression grow to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow because of the seasonal change of
temperatures, even within indoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: the outside affects that and the soil and
the grow technique and the water pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're seeing a still wide variety
of that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the nutrient companies working
with the breeders is going to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to bring it back to the last
question, you mentioned working with
[SPEAKER_00]: Masonic and I saw that you'd done some
collabs with Big Mace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit about that and what
sort of things we can expect from those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this year we ended up with lots of seed
stock from last year's biodynamic project,
[SPEAKER_02]: where we tried to, you know, torture the
hell out of all the males and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, put them next to Russet mite
infected plants and the whole nine year
[SPEAKER_02]: and break them in half, rip off their
balls, time the days it takes for the
[SPEAKER_02]: balls to regenerate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start with the hundred males.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so last year, the Wilson's cake
crasher just had an amazing vigor,
[SPEAKER_02]: no matter what you did, ripped it down,
broke it in half.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still was growing just like normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had already had experience with
females making good Rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had my nice fruity, you know,
lemon Fatmans that I'm wanting to increase
[SPEAKER_02]: their Rosin yield and hold onto that lemon
turp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured the Wilson cake crasher is a
good project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the whole wedding crasher Wilson
name, you know, and then the lemon Fatman,
[SPEAKER_02]: we figured of calling it like Owen Wilson
or just Owen after that movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically we'll have the different
costumes that Owen has played throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: his like Hollywood career as the different
pheno hunts, as we go through the
[SPEAKER_02]: different frozen plants of this seed
variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people will get to try a sour Owen,
offensive Owen, lemon Owen, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I obviously I'm pretty
undogmatic as far as like seed guys go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I go to places where I trade seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to the seed swaggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've been going to Emerald Cup
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, Masonic was just always down to
trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it came time to like put seeds in
the earth, like I must've grown 30
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders my first year here on the farm in
2015.
And.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you just freeze them and then
you look at the numbers, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you look at who survived,
who just fell over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the bugs ate you up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, Masonic's always hit of up 4%
for our live rosin process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even ones that, you know, didn't look
that healthy still made good rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like other plants, you know,
they would look pretty good and then give
[SPEAKER_02]: us 2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So eliminated those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so we need someone who's
passionate and excited about keeping the
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pass the test and he's a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all the information I need.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've seen so many people say that
their seeds are so fancy and charge so
[SPEAKER_02]: much for them and they look good too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they just don't perform.
[SPEAKER_02]: So proofs in the pudding, you know,
I think everyone needs more science in
[SPEAKER_02]: their life and less dogma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely proofs in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to factor that more into
my explanation of things, but I'd love to
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that trop flavor is on like
oranges in general, I think are coming
[SPEAKER_00]: back into focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they died off for a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they're coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know, because I think you
would have your finger on the pulse more
[SPEAKER_00]: than most anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: What flavor do you think is going to be
the next big thing to hit the scene?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you think in general of the
scene at the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know how Bloom Seed Co.,
you know, you're familiar with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got their drop, you know,
of the strawberry guava tropicana cookies
[SPEAKER_02]: and their pink marshmallow across the
strawberry guava.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as, yeah, trop cookies,
man, I had this indoor trop cookie from
[SPEAKER_02]: Heads That Roll, who won the ego clash the
last few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen pink rosin until now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was bright pink.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, I've never seen anything
like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They pressed it such a low temp to
preserve some of the purple anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it made this pink rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my God, the high was the strongest,
most effective for like athletic
[SPEAKER_02]: performance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I hit this before the skate park and
I had the best skate of my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I put away that gram and would
only hit it right before I was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: the skate park forever after.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to be growing the trop cookie
crosses this 2023 here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just reminded me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember that last video you posted of
you shredding it up at the skate park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it made my day to just see someone
crushing it on the blades.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long you been doing it for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It started at 14.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: More than 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can still go higher in the air than all
the skateboarders or scooters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm strapped in and I can do flips.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be 40 in January.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know many 40 year olds who don't
have any gray hair and still do flips with
[SPEAKER_02]: a skateboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's something to me giving
up smoking weed and shifting my whole life
[SPEAKER_02]: to the future of dabs and fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I can be that example, I am right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I am the living example.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're falling apart because you
switched to 100% dabs, no one's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: follow you down that road.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I forget, I got to encourage
everyone to go to your page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to follow up on what you just said,
that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're no flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just dabs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you like low temp only?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any other components to sort of
this lifestyle you adhere to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seven years, low temp dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some, you know, vape pens, no desolate,
you know, nothing weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only stuff from my farm or from my
friend's farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say everyone, man, woman,
especially if you're in your thirties,
[SPEAKER_02]: please get a testosterone test,
get a hormone test, figure out where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you need to change your diet
because you're too dogmatic, maybe it's
[SPEAKER_02]: time and listen to science because that's
what helped me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had insomnia, I had all sorts of issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I run my own business with five
employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have seeds going to all over the world,
Peru, Austria recently, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it takes health to make a healthy,
successful business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot within yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a lot of people get successful and
then the next year just falls apart
[SPEAKER_02]: because they can't maintain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to invest always with
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've eaten a lot of my investments.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've made money and then I'll
just eat really good food, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: and get really healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can do a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is some incredibly sage advice,
which I would urge everyone to take on
[SPEAKER_00]: board for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely is an investment in yourself
that's worth doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask quickly if you had
theoretically unlimited resources or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're even a bit in the future
where, you know, there's like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more technology than what currently
exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think will be the absolute
ultimate way to extract cannabis resin in
[SPEAKER_00]: a sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you got me thinking, you know,
with the pink rosin you spoke about,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, okay, that's like the next
level up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've done like a bit of a game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Changer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think theoretically will be
like the ultimate you can foresee?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you talk to some scientists and some
extraction artists, they say the ultimate
[SPEAKER_02]: thing would be like, like a cold tube,
like a cold trap, like without water or
[SPEAKER_02]: without anything, just a conveyor belt and
a tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the time the weed, the product gets
to the end, it's gone through pure
[SPEAKER_02]: sublimation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you could sublimely separate those
THC parts, it would be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're talking hundreds of millions of
dollars and engineers, but yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could extract THC through sublimation
through the process of the temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: changing itself rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it would, it would essentially
go from being in the tricone to just
[SPEAKER_00]: turning into gas and then collecting it
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you could get it to absolute
zero super quick, then everything might
[SPEAKER_02]: just fall apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was just on a conveyor belt with a
90u micron screen underneath, with
[SPEAKER_02]: nanotechnology, you know, to separate all
the little bits, to capture the bits
[SPEAKER_02]: before that part, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it is cool to think, yeah,
what's, what's possible, but there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food for thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really interested to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To take us back to just a question before,
when you were talking about growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: various breeders out door, I would love to
ask who are some breeders who you've
[SPEAKER_00]: generally been impressed by their work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, obviously third gen Brandon,
all his amazing Skittles stuff is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, super time tested from his farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has that genetic work.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the guys who's moved into the
consulting space, Dragon with matches,
[SPEAKER_02]: always had outstanding genetics,
Bodie's your staple guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he's going to be mainstream because of
his burner deal, which I think is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He needs to get paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's done so much work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for so long, you know,
there's a Bloom seed Co is just killing it
[SPEAKER_02]: because they were breeding for a full melt
before rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just making dank full melt
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so they have a headstart on a
lot of people right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bloom seed Co just took, you know,
the smoking jacket with cannabis Chris's
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction and growing skills.
[SPEAKER_02]: They found like a pineapple empanada,
Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, I've been putting seeds
in the earth and seeing, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: who does well, like for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I was able to give that Aussie
Lotto to Jigga because he came to the ego
[SPEAKER_02]: clash one year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully Cookies realizes that,
you know, they should start a tribal fund
[SPEAKER_02]: for Aborigines and grow that strain out
and they can make a bunch of PR and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to quickly ask, because you
referenced Brandon there and in past
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, you referenced the ego clash.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on the current state
of the cups?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've noticed, like, more and more
people seem to be more excited for these
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller, more organic based events like
the ego clash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the general trend is that things like
the Emerald Cup sort of feel like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: dying off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your analysis of the state of the
industry in that respect?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was heartbreaking to see because I've
had fun with you there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've given you a mind blowing dab that
changed your mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, that's why I went to Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it existed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that shit is gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: That shit has changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that shit is no more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year was the ultimate slap in the
face of like, let's allow a huge beer
[SPEAKER_02]: garden from the biggest corporate beer
thing we can think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's push all the small farmers into
one area so no one can actually see how
[SPEAKER_02]: cool they are spread out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's harass them with their displays
because they're showing people weed that
[SPEAKER_02]: they would smell in a jar and then they
could buy in a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's harass them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the fucking Bureau of Cannabis
Control came out there all Karen like,
[SPEAKER_02]: like super Karen's like, let's stop this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are these guys trading hash or are you
selling it?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have to confiscate this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like so different than all the
years before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could tell, like, they didn't even
know what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was like this whole, you know,
social media blitz with the Humboldt local
[SPEAKER_02]: and got a shot of them being all fucking
shady and harassing everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we're just people, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just you're the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're supposed to help us.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, get the fuck out of here,
dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we are good people and we make
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not the cartel you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are they producing all this pounds?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're here at the Emerald Cup,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, come on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole thing fell apart and went
corporate and there was so much douchery
[SPEAKER_02]: and so much trickery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, you could go up to like a booth
and be like, oh, like, hey, what could I
[SPEAKER_02]: see the weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, no, like, you can't
smell the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't smell the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, and like some booths would be
like, OK, fuck it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to break the rule here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can like smell the weed, but you can't
hold it or you can't like see it up close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Jesus Christ, dude, do you know how
to do business or do you just like and
[SPEAKER_02]: then like all the free giveaways couldn't
give away something free.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had like this ridiculous penny jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like one penny jars filled with
pennies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another one's filled with like
nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you take one penny and put it in
the other jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're like, no, here's a free
joint to pay like all these wastes of time
[SPEAKER_02]: bureaucracy, like absolutely horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: These people from Sacramento who made up
these laws have never taken the time to
[SPEAKER_02]: farm anything in their fucking lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish they would.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish that the governor had made it so
that agronomists and like people with
[SPEAKER_02]: degrees in university studies within our
system would hire people who knew about
[SPEAKER_02]: plants to work for the Bureau of Cannabis
Control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, they hired people who knew
nothing about anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now we're left with this space of
unelected officials, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially stopping the largest global
cannabis market in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: What an apt analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's fair to say you won't be
going to the Emerald Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're going to do the ego clash.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to serve waffles at the ego
clash, and then we're going to go to T.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beasle's birthday for the next day and
serve waffles again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking going to the Emerald Cup,
but I was like, I can't bring myself to
[SPEAKER_02]: buy a ticket like even the scene has
changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like last year, I even wanted to see the
headliner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this year, the headliner is like E 40
and all these gangster rappers who aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: that good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole thing is, yeah, gone down to
I mean, I'd love to hear in general your
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis and sort of thoughts on the
current state of the legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of people feel like small
farmers are perpetually being pushed out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to have a small scale operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see the need for change in
the laws?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you like to see changed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, as I've said before, you know,
fucking worldwide weed blockchain analysis
[SPEAKER_02]: of the terpenes to market the information,
the genetic analysis is to show the
[SPEAKER_02]: terroir to show the pharmaceutical
industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then boom, I can sell my specific
thing to Israel.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they want to research it, I can sell it
to some sick person in Germany.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's a lab here actually able
to just bring them the pound, they can
[SPEAKER_02]: process it, give me the magic stamp,
give it to an exportation business that
[SPEAKER_02]: deals with the state to interstate to
intercountry commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And boom, there you go, everyone gets paid
and small farming continues.
[SPEAKER_02]: There needs to be stricter regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like what I said before,
the there's no agronomists, there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: people who are bought in this,
who are working within the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're actually allowing for all this
poison to like come out where people are
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding and spraying too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the pesticides that are
allowed on the white market will make for
[SPEAKER_02]: a shitty experience for the consumer in
the end run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they're prohibited, it would make
it harder to grow cannabis at scale,
[SPEAKER_02]: and thus less people would enter the
market or fail miserably.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's this whole thing where it's like
the ethics of organics can protect the
[SPEAKER_02]: small craft farmer because doing organics
at scale will never compete because it
[SPEAKER_02]: always goes crazy and falls down on its
face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's not what it's meant to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not meant to be scalable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of curiosity, what do you think is the
upper limit that an organic facility could
[SPEAKER_00]: operate at if someone was like,
you know, I'm happy to accept your advice,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't scale infinitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what do you think is the upper limit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've been having discussions with
friends about everyone wants to call
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like if you've got a certain,
you know, if you've got a 10 acre farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that craft?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a hundred acre, you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, where does craft end, I guess?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the upper limit for organic
indoor, in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, the whole craft thing and
small batch and nano batch and all these
[SPEAKER_02]: discussions are, you know, they're great
because that's what we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to define this kind of undefinable
thing that's gonna help perpetuate small
[SPEAKER_02]: craft farmers to thrive and help those who
don't want to stay that transition into
[SPEAKER_02]: something that will thrive that won't
compete with them, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would love it if I saw like,
you know, a five acre cap, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, if you've ever seen five acres
of production, like it doesn't look
[SPEAKER_02]: anything small or craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've seen 3.5 acres that looks
insane, like a wall to a, 3.5 acres takes
[SPEAKER_02]: a hundred people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, how many employees do you have to
manage?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, when is it small craft?
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like once you go above like,
if you get to like 20 people to like run
[SPEAKER_02]: the farm, that's not a small craft farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're having team meetings.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got multiple employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got multiple shift managers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's big.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to, yeah, it's hard to like,
if like 10 people can like manage all that
[SPEAKER_02]: and then have a crew come in and harvest,
then fuck more power to them, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the small craft farmer will
always be defined because that's what it
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can just literally take test all
the stuff and see that anything big does
[SPEAKER_02]: not make the good terpenes, anything fed
all the salts, doesn't have all the fancy
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's more about the market
understanding what it needs and thus
[SPEAKER_02]: demanding that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all the people who produce will
have to flex to that or realize that they
[SPEAKER_02]: can't flex to that and try something else
instead of competing with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't spoke about it much yet,
but obviously, you know, you're an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: biodynamic guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me, what's the difference between
like synthetic or salt-based concentrates?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the thing you notice is the
difference?
[SPEAKER_02]: So my friend started Growth Science
Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have an organic line and a
conventional line or synthetic line.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I ran my auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the opportunity to run the same
strain, completely organic and completely
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Freeze the material, label it,
extract it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the synthetic material made larger
diamonds, less terpenes and considerably
[SPEAKER_02]: less yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1.5% out of the total biomass weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the biomass growth was at least
40 to 30% more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the organics grew smaller, had smaller
flowering sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 3.5 and 4% yield versus a 1.5% yield
on your fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And smaller diamonds, more terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of people would sort of say
that that's very much in line with sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the conventional things we hear in terms
of organics, you know, maybe yields a
[SPEAKER_00]: little less, but higher quality,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to ask you, because you're so
involved in the sort of concentrates
[SPEAKER_00]: realm, does that spill over for you into
the edibles realm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we've been making, you know,
chocolates and gummies and taffies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been making chocolates for what,
20 years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always made edibles and love the
infusion and the difference between the
[SPEAKER_02]: edible high and the dabbing or smoking
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know, what's your go-to edible?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just recently gained a better
appreciation for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to hear what's your favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you make like, you know,
rosin, you get like the 45U is like the
[SPEAKER_02]: food grade, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like there's the 90U,
which is like the dabbing grade and like
[SPEAKER_02]: 120 is like still dabbing grade.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a few grades, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you make rosin, you have some
like food grade where it can, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: collect some particulates or some plant
matter and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But mostly the process is down where it
doesn't have anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still a smooth smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not, you know, as potent,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we would use for our
edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Gold Country collab we did came
out really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we like send, you know, all this 40U
rosin down to these master bakers in LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honey and Honey Chocolates Company and the
Starfire Edibles people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they, you know, use half of the
rosin for their edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they make a bunch of edibles with
the other half with us and then send it
[SPEAKER_02]: packaged back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then essentially we have all these like
gourmet donuts and vegan donuts and
[SPEAKER_02]: handmade marshmallows, handmade white
pumpkin spice chocolates, all with rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll send back 15 flavors of
chocolates.
[SPEAKER_02]: 17 flavors of donuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a plethora.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you find that you get different effects
based on the strain input or by the point
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're at like a donut, it's more of
a homogenous sort of feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a big discussion right now with
all the edible makers and all the rosin
[SPEAKER_02]: guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really glad you asked this because I
have a particular perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the rumor is, it's not confirmed,
is that West Coast Alchemy to achieve
[SPEAKER_02]: their wet look on 100% of their 90U,
not all cultivars will, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: release a 90U that looks wet, is that they
do a terpene separation on the 40U.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some cultivars produce amazing
terpenes that are caught in the 40U bag
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're making live rosin and making
bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically you can put the 40U and
squish it for like six hours at super low
[SPEAKER_02]: temp and put it at an angle and you'll
separate all the terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll drip out into a jar and the THCA
will be left.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can take those terpenes and then
add it to your 90U.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now your 90U looks super wet and
glistens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so basically most cooking processes
are going to destroy your volatile
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all these strains specific terpene,
we put the rosin in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, nah, like I've made gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made them with all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know about terpenes and
volatilization.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're boiling that sugar mixture
to make your gummies, all the terpenes are
[SPEAKER_02]: gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it doesn't make any sense for the rosin
makers to do it other than that it's extra
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's lazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like you have a bunch of 40U,
just give it to the edible maker and then
[SPEAKER_02]: give me some edible maker's back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can call it the strain that it is,
but really they should be separating the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes so that people can dab that and
then giving the edible makers pure
[SPEAKER_02]: decarbed THCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess maybe the underlying question
behind the last question was, do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: that the terpenes for the most part are
what dictates the effect?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, do you think if you stripped it all
away and you've just got the THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% there and maybe a few minor
cannabinoids that it's all going to seem
[SPEAKER_00]: quite generic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask you, I'm surprised I
haven't asked already.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the most unique terps you've ever
come across?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the unique terpene that I found was
when my mom was over in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting me some ruteralis seeds and she
actually got me unfeminized ruteralis on
[SPEAKER_02]: accident, some CBD one-to-one ruteralis
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we bred that into Mephisto's and I
brought that to the lab and they found
[SPEAKER_02]: this terpene called Borneal as the
dominant terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had never found this before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they had just had a meta data
scientist plot all 15,000 successful
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene tests that they have done on
cannabis into a chart to show them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they showed me how almost 80% is mercy
and dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's some piney ones and some
Jack ones and a few others and how mine
[SPEAKER_02]: was like, they've never seen Borneal at
3.3% as the dominant terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had always been a super, super small
amount, 0.0001 or 0.01 in the other
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that really sent me on my whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently I've seen lab results for the
cranberry Skittles cross and it's got some
[SPEAKER_02]: high amounts of eucalyptol, which I'm
absolutely in love with this flavor of
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I feel like that's a good Australia
kind of thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can get the cranberry Z there,
grow it under eucalyptus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will it express more eucalyptol?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the mad scientist experiments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to make them happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I'd love to hear like what 's
your advice for someone who wants to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into breeding some autos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you wish you could tell
yourself looking back with what you know
[SPEAKER_00]: now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Always save 10 C's of everything that you
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that if you grow everything out and you
find a winner and your pollination is not
[SPEAKER_02]: successful, you haven't lost that line
forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then always unzip and zip.
[SPEAKER_02]: So feminize one year and then unfeminize
the next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And know what to look for in males and
time your males, stress your males,
[SPEAKER_02]: look up close at the trichomes of your
males and keep track of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the hardest part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if you have seeds that don't get
labeled, they're like, ah, it's a lot to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep track of.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your characteristics for picking an
auto male?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you just mentioned some of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them have resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like do you, do you put a lot of weight or
emphasis on that in terms of that smell
[SPEAKER_00]: being a trait it passes on or is it more
complex?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm looking at branching.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at how many ball sacks and how
close together the ball sacks are growing
[SPEAKER_02]: and the internodal and the vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you're feminizing, you know,
oftentimes if you know the seed is a
[SPEAKER_02]: winner and you like know it's from an
established breeder who's won awards,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you spend a bunch of money on like
five fucking seeds and you want to make
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you just want to look for the
first one that expresses sexuality.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one that expresses that hair,
you fucking take that separately and you
[SPEAKER_02]: spray that down and start reversing her.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just so I understand it, basically all
auto strains, more or less like are
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what you've described where like
you have to just test out the progeny and
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't really get to know because the
parents get burnt up in the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And breeding long season into auto flowers
is five generation, four generation
[SPEAKER_02]: process because it's a recessive trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I hit something, you know,
male with an auto flower and only 10%,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe 5% will be auto flower out of that
seed stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first, F1 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then would you just F2 them for a
bunch more generations until you got close
[SPEAKER_00]: to a hundred percent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how would you go from that F1 cross to
the point of being like, Hey, I've now got
[SPEAKER_00]: gelato auto.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically you would have to start out
with some auto flower that you had,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hit it with something that you
wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that first generation of those seeds,
you basically would kill off 90% of the
[SPEAKER_02]: seed stock because you can tell that it's
not going to auto flower within the
[SPEAKER_02]: timing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're just like casting hell of seeds
being like, Oh, this is going long,
[SPEAKER_02]: kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So one out of 10 is going to like go
quick, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then it either have your feminized
pollen ready to paint on, or you're
[SPEAKER_02]: feminizing something actively so that it
times up with that release.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ovum and everything is ready so you
can make some seeds, but it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why feminized auto flowers are
expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've done successful runs three
times in a row, and then I failed three
[SPEAKER_02]: times in a row afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each time a unique thing happened that
stopped me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was so unique that I couldn't
perceive that it was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think by four or five
generations, you could have pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable certainty that when you do the
FEM reversal to sort of make the seeds you
[SPEAKER_00]: plan to sell, that they're all going to be
auto four or five generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, you know, 1000 seed, 2000 seed test
before I release them so that there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: herms and no autos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you think in general is going
to be the future of autos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's obviously this ongoing
discussion about like, is it ever going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be as good as a photo?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think we're almost there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you foresee them doing
primarily in the future as like a tool?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had this responded to this post
Dungeon Vault Genetics, who I really like
[SPEAKER_02]: all his work and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: He posted like, why does everyone grow
autos?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he's actually grown my autos.
[SPEAKER_02]: He likes them.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was just like posing this question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do people grow autos if like
everything else is so much better and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so much better weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, well, if you feel that
way, sounds like a business opportunity to
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a consumer opportunity to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consumers are constantly disappointed by
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like someone hasn't done the
fucking work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm willing to do that work.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hey, let's do it and let's use the lab,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's how Mephisto got famous is
they got a cut of the first lab tested
[SPEAKER_02]: proven above 22% THC to reverse into auto.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's literally how they did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't do it with fucking magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got the first lab tested cut that was
above 20% back in the day when you
[SPEAKER_02]: couldn't find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean they're auto tested at that or
they use that as a mother stock?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: To make their first auto, to get away from
all these low percentage autos that were
[SPEAKER_02]: all made from low rider.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone had a bad taste in their
mouth and autos.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got, I can't remember what it's the,
like one of the oldest guys you've had
[SPEAKER_02]: them on your show too.
[SPEAKER_02]: He passed away recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bog?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bog.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they, that's how they made their first
autos was a bog and a ruderalis that was
[SPEAKER_02]: not a, you know, the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shitty ones from before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they reversed his four
generations to make their first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What cool backstory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be curious to hear your thoughts
on low rider in general, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't really hear much from
that dude who made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, what's your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's just like the best he could do
at the time before gas chromatography and
[SPEAKER_02]: testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then it just didn't have ever above 12%
THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no one really wanted to grow it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once people started to see what potency
was and figure out light depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like no fucking reason, but it had
its place for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as they figured out of above
20% CHC and autos and it's on,
[SPEAKER_02]: and everyone was blown away when I would
bring it to the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were like, this isn't like depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what they were so impressed to make
diamonds out of the stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, all the guys who work at the
lab, they run through thousands of pounds
[SPEAKER_02]: of material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whenever they see mine, they're like,
Ooh, look at this unique smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the fresh rain turp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got the fresh, you know, this turp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you think that stock, the low rider
was unfortunately like backed into a
[SPEAKER_00]: corner in that it would be hard to salvage
it, so to speak?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've abandoned many of my genetics
already, you know, cause I marked them
[SPEAKER_02]: dead ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I can tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to abandon the seed stock of the
autos or just extract it all and not
[SPEAKER_02]: market for breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you understand the traits that it's
expressing or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to help the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what I said, the future of auto
flowers is full melt auto flowers from all
[SPEAKER_02]: the best breeders so that no one can copy
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everyone can get a little bit of bud,
a little bit of hash every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can make that culture from Amsterdam,
like for New York city, have that fucking,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, grow outside of my little
apartment on the windowsill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and do you plan to ever do some more
photo period breeding or do you think
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just going to stick to autos for
the moment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're, we're always doing auto
flowers and regulars just because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: way the market is right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like they're, we're not to the
point where we want the full melt auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to keep working with all the
nice full melt regular genetics and keep
[SPEAKER_02]: figuring out what the trending terpene
profiles are.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year I work with the Chile Verde male
and the 24 karat gold male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, resin ranches picked them out and they
passed a lot of my tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to see a lot of cool chili
pepper crosses like Shishito.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hit the cake bomb skittles with the
Chile Verde.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm most excited about our lemon cane
number 66 from Ashuk.
[SPEAKER_02]: He hunted the lemon cane to work for the
rosin process really well, kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: how I wanted my lemon fat man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hit the Chile Verde onto that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so right now there is a flavor trend
within Latin culture and within California
[SPEAKER_02]: of this flavor called tahin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you know about tahin,
but yeah, we'll be releasing, we'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: releasing lemon tahin at ego clash on the
ninth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have tahin flavored rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh dude, you're going to have to cross
that to, um, something watermelon flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the old staple tahin on
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the chamoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know about chamoy?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the other spice that you
actually put on watermelon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got the watermelon ice from Kanna
research, which is garlic cocktail and
[SPEAKER_02]: pineapple fizz cross together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got the freaking watermelon
turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hit that with Chile Verde.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're doing tahin and chamoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, beautiful, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got me excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, take me back the question we
normally ask people at the start of the
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your first experience with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: So my first experience getting high was at
the shoreline amphitheater at like a big
[SPEAKER_02]: concert where my friend who, um,
grew his own cannabis and everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, at 16 was like, here you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's this clay pipe I fired in my oven
and made myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's this weed I grew myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prepared myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And stuck little incense sticks in a
circle around me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized that everyone else,
the concert was fucking high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, Oh shit, everyone's doing
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Oh damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, no matter how old people are,
everyone's high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was a great 16 year old moment of
like realizing that like cannabis unites
[SPEAKER_02]: the world and all people and all cultures
and all ethnicities and all age groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's honestly, why I keep doing the sesh
in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the sesh, the pop-up seshes because
every race, every sexual orientation and
[SPEAKER_02]: every age group can come and ask me about
all my cannabis products and the farm and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone can learn and come together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets me the highest of anything is the
biodiversity of humanity and the
[SPEAKER_02]: biodiversity in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, a hundred percent, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only been to one of the seshes in
Oakland before, but like the vibe was
[SPEAKER_00]: popping, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like so fun just to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was exactly how you described.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, it was really diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what cannabis is about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the model that will be
sustainable in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a small little market pop-up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer, killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to me about how you went from that
shoreline experience to thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to plant my own seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was lucky enough to go to college and
grow up in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understood the lifestyle somewhat,
really started to unpeel the meaning of
[SPEAKER_02]: Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I went to UC Santa Cruz and sold
cannabis out of my little, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: apartment dorm room there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned a lot and really brought
people together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was so inspired by all the growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a frat scene at UC Santa
Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just go to Burning Man, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like all these people who had come
before me had grown and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: successfully and sold their weed and made
successful companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were throwing big parties at
Burning Man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they told me how much this plant had
given to them, how much it provided and
[SPEAKER_02]: how much they had taught, you know,
just they had learned in general about
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves and the world and been able to
be a man with a plan and help the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was very inspiring to see a lot of
these psychedelic warriors out in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world and representing their Santa Cruz
vibe and teaching people about cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: and learning the science simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, just in the scene of
just smoking weed and living out,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, renting houses while finishing
your degree, you learn how to grow weed if
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you got roommates, they're growing
weeds that you're going to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of a sudden it's like, wait,
like this thing that really grows and it
[SPEAKER_02]: just brings people together and it's so
diverse and there's so many flavors and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so many highs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of like at the birth moment,
like from 2001 to 2006, where everyone
[SPEAKER_02]: started to really get into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched our 420 little party at UC Santa
Cruz go from like, you know, 420 people in
[SPEAKER_02]: like 2002.
[SPEAKER_02]: To 14,000 people by the time I graduated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're talking exponential growth
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff was growing so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was learning so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was making so much money and
throwing such cool parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just an amazing scene to grow
up in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was so inspired and I, you know,
made food for the parties as like a
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a side hustle, you know,
and would sell my chocolates and these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I basically, you know, went homeless
during college and lived on people's decks
[SPEAKER_02]: and live in the forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes had my stuff in lockers on
campus, bike around, sell weed at the
[SPEAKER_02]: skate park.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I really, really believed in
cannabis and it believed in me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew I had to sacrifice everything,
all my comforts, all the things that I
[SPEAKER_02]: knew were important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I had to sacrifice them so I could
learn about this new thing that no one
[SPEAKER_02]: knew about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I could be ahead when the time came.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that turned out to be really tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I needed a lot of help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And luckily, one day at a big rave where I
had made all the fanciest chocolate treats
[SPEAKER_02]: and sushi and all this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy came up to me and he's like,
bro, I got this weed grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You seem so awesome and smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I have all these people, like,
can you like feed us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're just up on the hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, can you feed us?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, okay, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I like built a yurt on this guy's
land after we got there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we got along, he ended up being the
direct descendant of Steiner, like his
[SPEAKER_02]: name's Matthew Steiner, like as of,
you know, Rudolf Steiner who made
[SPEAKER_02]: biodynamics, invented it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy who founded Waldorf School and
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to learn biodynamics from a
direct descendant of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So who was applying it to cannabis for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause he was the black sheep of the fam
with a very full debt to her and took
[SPEAKER_02]: acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like, oh shit, this is like the
opportunity of a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy's like breeding seeds and has a
degree in biology and like teaches me to
[SPEAKER_02]: collect the mycelial leaf litter to make
mushroom tea for the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, wow, I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I fucking did that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched him do really good and fail in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I helped at other farms and I got super
inspired and I saw so much waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I knew that moment when I could plant
my seed, I would be ready and I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: waste anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was, and I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I got the farm and we got the flavors
and we got employees and we got people
[SPEAKER_02]: believe in us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my t-shirt and you know,
new seeds coming out all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dream come true, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like hard work pays off and sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's beautiful to hear, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome to hear you've lived such
an interesting and varied life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something we referenced earlier that I
want to ask you about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's your plans to get your work more
widely available?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think you want to get yourself out
there at say more distributors,
[SPEAKER_00]: get more of your product out there,
or do you still want to keep it a small
[SPEAKER_00]: scale operation in a certain sense?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll still be a small scale operation,
but we want to expand our reach as far as,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, feminize seeds, we'll be doing
feminized seeds as well as feminized auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers in the future, all for resin
production for the white and black market
[SPEAKER_02]: so that people can produce resin on their
own independently or for big companies
[SPEAKER_02]: that want to like run with our flavors so
that more people can be aware of the cool
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors that I'm, you know, trying to make
for people, trying to make new experiences
[SPEAKER_02]: for people on the cannabis market to blow
their minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just got to keep up and do that
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you know, we're willing to make
those thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're never going to make like,
you know, multi-millions, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're never going to make multi-millions
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're always going to have that quality
seed and get that out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's the goal for the
future is to win some awards with my
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my next goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which award would be the one you'd be
most keen to achieve in your career?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, just, you know, something for the
rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just something that blows everyone's mind,
you know, so that people, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like if I could, ideally, this is what I
really want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make an auto flower rosin flavor
that wins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people don't know it's auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then people are like, oh shit,
I've always talked shit about auto flowers
[SPEAKER_02]: because I thought they were the same as
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I screwed it up when I grew it,
but maybe I should look into that again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brilliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, as a sort of just a rough
guess, how far off in time do you think we
[SPEAKER_00]: are from when that sort of thing might be
possible?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, only 12 months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working on this last five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just another year push.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think by this time next year we'll have
the full melt genetics that will be making
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin in 80 days from the seed germination
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to ask, is there anywhere
people can go to get your seeds now?
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now the website still hasn't
gotten built, but we're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically the plan for the next
three months.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so far we just, you know, just go on
Instagram and let me know where you're at
[SPEAKER_02]: and figure out if our local laws can make
it work.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in touch with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a question I love to ask all our
guests, from your perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't have to be from the general
public's perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be because of some special reason
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you, what's the rarest seeds in your
vault?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have, you know, just a few seeds
of land race, like pure land race that I
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't popped yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have those pure Tanzanian.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some pure Argentinian.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some pure Crimean from the Crimean
peninsula.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually grew those out this year and
I'm very excited about that because I
[SPEAKER_02]: found cannabis that I've never really
found before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did one post about it basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It flowered, it got seeded, and then it
flowered again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once it got the signal that it was
seeded, it grew four more branches from
[SPEAKER_02]: its root zone and started flowering again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that got seeded and then it
flowered again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it flowered five times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I hit that, I crossed that with the
Satsuma Sherb.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thinking about like the future of
cannabis where it's like a auto flower
[SPEAKER_02]: timing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in 80 days you get like a QP and then
100 days later you get a half pound and
[SPEAKER_02]: then October you get even more and you cut
it back three times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm most excited about for
genetic traits is something I've never
[SPEAKER_02]: seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard anything about that at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this next one is a general question,
but I'm wondering, what is your hope
[SPEAKER_00]: overall for the trajectory of the scene?
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that the legacy operators and like
those who care and have won awards
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-2016 who have families will continue
to thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I sincerely hope that the billionaires
and Canadian investors continue to go
[SPEAKER_02]: bankrupt because it's not helping
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't believe the facility they built
in Death Valley over here in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like over a hundred million dollar
glass house.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hot water that comes out of the earth
naturally there is like 110 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have all these chillers just to
get the water cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just couldn't help but think like
they could have just put cow poop on the
[SPEAKER_02]: earth and put a barbed wire fence and then
just gotten those Afghani genetics that
[SPEAKER_02]: can just withstand hot weather all year or
Moroccan and then just done a land race in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Death Valley instead of building a
hundred million dollar facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like anyone who's like kind of
like trying to like build their way to
[SPEAKER_02]: their empire needs to just stop and like
do something else and like realize that
[SPEAKER_02]: like, you know, there's people who care
and there's people who have done the
[SPEAKER_02]: business for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you can buy their IP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some guys will sell you their intellectual
property or whatever, but anyone who would
[SPEAKER_02]: do that doesn't really know or doesn't
really care about being in it long-term.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a, it's a tricky point right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of guys who are doing that
right now, my age who are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I've been in the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to sell all my information
to a rich guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I don't have to worry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can raise my family.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying I judge you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying like, man, it sucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like the paradigm shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, definitely a tough situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to blame people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to follow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned it a few times, the greasy
versus tacky feeling of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you often hear people talking
about greasy being good for concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I believe you broke it down into like
a further sort of subdivision.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you describe to people like the
way trichomes should feel for each style
[SPEAKER_00]: of production?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ones that leave a slippery grease
on your fingers are the ones that are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make good diamonds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are going to be antagonistic to
the water process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like the alpha pining turp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we thought this one would wash last
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we had 6,000 grams of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect rainbow smell, but it was a little
piney and I was worried we got like a 0.5
[SPEAKER_02]: wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like half a percent, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But not only that, like the texture of it
gummed up all the filters in the water
[SPEAKER_02]: rosin process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then they had to do an alcohol wash
just to clean, just to do another run.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not only does it like screw everything
up, it makes it a lot harder to like make
[SPEAKER_02]: water hash again if you use the wrong
starting material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, yeah, the greasy material is
not going to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your super tacky material that like
stretches like a spider web or sandy to
[SPEAKER_02]: the touch, that can work a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then obviously the whole jar tech,
everyone talking about where you put 20
[SPEAKER_02]: grams of fresh frozen in a mason jar and
then shake it with ice cold water and then
[SPEAKER_02]: see what knocks off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea is that if you got 20 grams
and you've got a 5 percenter, then you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: see one gram of trichomes fall off into
the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should be able to see what a pile
of one gram looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't have that, then you're
looking at not a rosin winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great breakdown.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why the resin dial was invented
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting, interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So onto the final five questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask all our guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the single most memorable
cannabis experience you've ever had?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be like the strongest
hit, but just most memorable for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, by far being the judge, Taylor T.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beasle chose chose me as a secondary judge
for the Emerald Cup before Skittles was
[SPEAKER_02]: known as a strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so before Rosin was in the Emerald
Cup, I got to dab full melt and put it in
[SPEAKER_02]: order.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came to the Airbnb at midnight and I
stayed for five hours or four twenty in
[SPEAKER_02]: the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was so high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been that high in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Cuban grower and all the
guys in the resin industry were like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, we've got these hashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to put them in order.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to figure out a winner.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just have numbers on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to write notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be a judge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I fucking took dabs of everything and
took notes and, you know, five stars,
[SPEAKER_02]: six star.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of flavors, multiple flavors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a flavor on the inhale,
in the mouth?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there an aftertaste?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it genetically similar to something
I've had or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I did all those things on 20 Rosins and
then put them in an order.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they made me dab them again and
make sure that the top five were the top
[SPEAKER_02]: five.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I voted for this number one that I
remember the note still multiple fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time I hit it, even the second
time, I found other fruit flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that ended up being the Skittles,
which is what made Brandon famous and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was definitely the best high
experience was like trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: the shit with no names and just numbers on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for clarification sake,
what do you think of the genetics in
[SPEAKER_00]: Skittles?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, everyone's fucking like,
oh, it's a pink grapefruit and oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a green sherbert.
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, it's like, I mean, I just like,
yo, let's see the turp test.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know how to grow it and it's high
in osamine, then it's going to have the
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant terpene that almost all Rosin
doesn't have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most Rosin has limonene, mercy,
rosin or beta karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you try that osamine flavor,
if you grow it correctly and it has high
[SPEAKER_02]: osamine and it's the dominant one,
that's the Skittles fucking amazing,
[SPEAKER_02]: awesome flavor.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other end of the spectrum,
what is something where everyone was
[SPEAKER_00]: hyping it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You were super keen to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you did, you were left a bit
disappointed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gorilla glue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've never really liked Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone swears by their old school 98
Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather have Malibu pure crush any day
over that Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, you know, astringent limes
versus like a floral rush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so many people try to market all
these crosses like the Gelato 33.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the original Sherbert is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cherry pie is pretty overhyped.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of sour diesels, you know,
because the original cut so lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like everyone's like, oh,
this prefix on sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, there ain't no sour gas and
rancidity in here, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's why we're it's like why
there's opportunity, right, for
[SPEAKER_02]: geneticists, because there's like kind of
a lot of like mishmash flavor flavors that
[SPEAKER_02]: have been re hybridized too many times.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't taste like anything in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to drop you off on a desert
island and you can take three strains with
[SPEAKER_00]: you for the rest of time, what three
things are you going to take?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take clones or seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Durban poison for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honey bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: To offset that, it's like completely
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the opposite, like Durban poison
is fucking not sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It ain't fruity and it ain't, you know,
sedating at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the honey bananas does all those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sweet, sedating, fruity as fuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the one that I freaking love
recently?
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew a Wilson cross that was like a mind
flare.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know the background, but it tasted
like pink marshmallows.
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, I guess the TROP cookies because
the TROP cookies hit me harder than any.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, because that I didn't really
realize how good TROP cookies was until,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, someone with like living soil
indoor LED who like wins awards,
[SPEAKER_02]: like touches that cut and like actually
cares.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, luckily, heads that roll like
relocated to our zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I get to trade with them and try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just taste the care in that orange
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then that's not in honey bananas or
Durban.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good list.
[SPEAKER_00]: In an alternative situation, we're going
to drop someone else off at the island,
[SPEAKER_00]: someone you're not a big fan of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to pick which three strains we
leave them with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to leave them with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so they OK, so they like need a
lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's up to you what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: What three things are you going to leave
them with?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would leave them with like the land race
from Tanzania that probably has like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, five percent THC maybe,
you know, so they can like earn some
[SPEAKER_02]: respect for all like the work of the
continent of Africa and the thousands of
[SPEAKER_02]: years that people have done without
credit, you know, and then like green
[SPEAKER_02]: crack just because it's like a horrible
weed with a horrible high and a horrible
[SPEAKER_02]: name.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's see what's like really bland
like that's like like the like blue dream
[SPEAKER_02]: cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like like not the real Santa Cruz
blue dream, but like the blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, that's like the like, oh,
yeah, like, oh, God, damn, that one is
[SPEAKER_02]: horrible, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so like, hey, and it produces the
best looking blue dream buds better than
[SPEAKER_02]: the original.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has no turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like this horrible cut that
got around because someone was insidious
[SPEAKER_02]: like and decided to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should stay there with that,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the person who should go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so final question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could give you a time machine,
you can go back to any period in history.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go anywhere to collect some seeds
or clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to collect?
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't have to go back far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I would just go back to like 92 and
just like have you could get all that seed
[SPEAKER_02]: stock from the 80s and then some of those
new OGs and these things like the real
[SPEAKER_02]: pure Kush and all that exclusive stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just start breeding with it the
way I knew how.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then buy Bitcoin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be set.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is this time machine?
Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get in on the crypto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that just about brings us to
the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any general comments or shout
outs you'd like to make?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just appreciate your always
considerate dedication to your questions
[SPEAKER_02]: and your show, putting it out there and
being detailed about who you put on your
[SPEAKER_02]: show and all the things you have to go
